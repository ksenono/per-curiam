    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTCAREY V. MUSLADIN549 U. S. ____ (2006)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-785THOMAS L. CAREY,Warden, PETITIONERv.MATHEW MUSLADINon writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit[December 11, 2006]Justice Thomas\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.This Court has\nrecognized that certain courtroom practices are so inherently\nprejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial.Estellev.Williams,425 U. S. 501, 503\u2013506\n(1976);Holbrookv.Flynn,475 U. S. 560, 568\n(1986). In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying\nthe victim\u2019s image worn by the victim\u2019s family during respondent\u2019s\ntrial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial. We must\ndecide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law, as determined by\nthis Court. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1). We hold that it was\nnot.IOn May 13, 1994,\nrespondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the\nhome of Musladin\u2019s estranged wife, Pamela. At trial, Musladin\nadmitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in\nself-defense. A California jury rejected Musladin\u2019s self-defense\nargument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related\noffenses.During Musladin\u2019s\ntrial, several members of Studer\u2019s family sat in the front row of\nthe spectators\u2019 gallery. On at least some of the trial\u2019s 14 days,\nsome members of Studer\u2019s family wore buttons with a photo of Studer\non them.[Footnote 1] Prior to\nopening statements, Musladin\u2019s counsel moved the court to order the\nStuder family not to wear the buttons during the trial. The court\ndenied the motion, stating that it saw \u201cno possible prejudice to\nthe defendant.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.Musladin appealed his\nconviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997. He argued\nthat the buttons deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth\nAmendment rights. At the outset of its analysis, the Court of\nAppeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent\nprejudice to succeed on his claim and citedFlynn,supra, at 570, as providing the test for inherent\nprejudice. The Court of Appeal, quoting part ofFlynn\u2019s\ntest, made clear that it \u201cconsider[ed] the wearing of photographs\nof victims in a courtroom to be an \u2018impermissible factor coming\ninto play,\u2019 the practice of which should be discouraged.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 75a (quotingFlynn,supra, at\n570). Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quotingFlynn,\nsupra, at 571, that the buttons had not \u201cbranded defendant\n\u2018with an unmistakable mark of guilt\u2019 in the eyes of the jurors\u201d\nbecause \u201c[t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have\nbeen taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief\noccasioned by the loss of [a] family member.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 75a.At the conclusion of the state\nappellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas\ncorpus in federal district court pursuant to \u00a72254. In his\napplication, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently\nprejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by\nholding that the Studers\u2019 wearing of the buttons did not deprive\nhim of a fair trial. The District Court denied habeas relief but\ngranted a certificate of appealability on the buttons\nissue.The Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ,\nfinding that under \u00a72254 the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). According to the Court of Appeals, this\nCourt\u2019s decisions inWilliamsandFlynnclearly\nestablished a rule of federal law applicable to Musladin\u2019s case.Musladinv.Lamarque, 427 F.\u00a03d 653, 656\u2013658\n(2005). Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent\nin support of its conclusion thatWilliamsandFlynnclearly established the test for inherent prejudice\napplicable to spectators\u2019 courtroom conduct. 427 F.\u00a03d, at\n657\u2013658 (citingNorrisv.Risley, 918 F.\u00a02d\n828 (CA9 1990)). The Court of Appeals held that the state court\u2019s\napplication of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the\none stated inWilliamsandFlynn\u201cwas contrary to\nclearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable\napplication of that law.\u201d 427 F.\u00a03d, at 659\u2013660. The Court of\nAppeals denied rehearing en banc. 427 F.\u00a03d 647 (2005). We\ngranted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now\nvacate.IIUnder the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat.\n1219:\u201c(d)\u2002An application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the\njudgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\nunless the adjudication of the claim\u2014\u201c(1)\u2002resulted in a decision that was contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).InWilliamsv.Taylor,529\nU. S. 362(2000), we explained that \u201cclearly established\nFederal law\u201d in \u00a72254(d)(1) \u201crefers to the holdings, as opposed to\nthe dicta, of this Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant\nstate-court decision.\u201dId.,at 412. Therefore, federal\nhabeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of\nAppeal\u2019s decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable\napplication of this Court\u2019s applicable holdings.AInEstellev.WilliamsandFlynn, this\nCourt addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants\u2019\nfair-trial rights. InWilliams, the Court considered\n\u201cwhether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison\nclothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal\nprotection of the laws.\u201d 425 U. S., at 502. The Court stated that\n\u201cthe State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment,\ncompel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in\nidentifiable prison clothes,\u201did.,at 512, but held that\nthe defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried\nin prison clothes by failing to object at trial,id.,at\n512\u2013513.InFlynn,\nthe Court addressed whether seating \u201cfour uniformed state troopers\u201d\nin the row of spectators\u2019 seats immediately behind the defendant at\ntrial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial. 475 U. S., at\n562. The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so\ninherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.Id.,at 571. In reaching that holding, the Court stated\nthat \u201cthe question must be \u2026 whether \u2018an unacceptable risk is\npresented of impermissible factors coming into play.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 570 (quotingWilliams,supra, at\n505).BothWilliamsandFlynndealt with government-sponsored practices: InWilliams, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial\nin prison clothes, and inFlynn, the State seated the\ntroopers immediately behind the defendant. Moreover, in both cases,\nthis Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial\nthat they must be justified by an \u201cessential state\u201d policy or\ninterest.Williams, supra, at 505 (concluding that the\npractice \u201cfurther[ed] no essential state policy\u201d);Flynn,\nsupra, at 568\u2013569 (holding that the practice was not of the\nsort that had to be justified by an \u201cessential state\ninterest\u201d).BIn contrast to\nstate-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendant\u2019s\nfair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin\nobjects is an open question in our jurisprudence. This Court has\nnever addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct\nwas so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a\nfair trial.[Footnote 2] And\nalthough the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that\napplies to state conduct inWilliamsandFlynn,\nwe have never applied that test to spectators\u2019 conduct. Indeed,\npart of the legal test ofWilliamsandFlynn\u2014asking whether the practices furthered an essentialstateinterest\u2014suggests that those cases apply only to\nstate-sponsored practices.Reflecting the\nlack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely\nin their treatment of defendants\u2019 spectator-conduct claims. Some\ncourts have appliedWilliamsandFlynnto\nspectators\u2019 conduct.Norrisv.Risley,918\nF.\u00a02d, at 830\u2013831 (applyingWilliamsandFlynnto hold spectators\u2019 buttons worn during a trial\ndeprived the defendant of a fair trial);In\u00a0re Woods,\n154 Wash. 2d 400, 416\u2013418, 114 P.\u00a03d 607, 616\u2013617 (2005) (en\nbanc) (applyingFlynnbut concluding that ribbons worn by\nspectators did not prejudice the defendant). Other courts have\ndeclined to extendWilliamsandFlynnto\nspectators\u2019 conduct.Billingsv.Polk, 441\nF.\u00a03d 238, 246\u2013247 (CA4 2006) (\u201cThese precedents do not\nclearly establish that a defendant\u2019s right to a fair jury trial is\nviolated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably\nconveys a message about the matter before the jury\u201d);Davisv.State, No. 07\u201303\u20130457\u2013CR, 2006 WL\n1211091, *6\u20137 (Tex. App., May 3, 2006) (\u201cAppellant does not cite\nany authority holding the display of this type of item by\nspectators creates inherent prejudice\u201d). Other courts have\ndistinguishedFlynnon the facts.Pachlv.Zenon, 145 Ore. App. 350, 360, n.\u00a01, 929 P.\u00a02d\n1088, 1093\u20131094, n.\u00a01 (1996) (in banc). And still other courts\nhave ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on,\ndiscussing, or distinguishingWilliamsorFlynn.Bucknerv.State, 714 So.\u00a02d 384, 388\u2013389\n(Fla. 1998)(per curiam);Statev.Speed, 265 Kan. 26, 47\u201348, 961 P.\u00a02d 13, 29\u201330\n(1998);Nguyenv.State, 977 S.\u00a0W. 2d 450,\n457 (Tex. App. 1998);Kenyonv.State, 58 Ark.\nApp. 24, 33\u201335, 946 S.\u00a0W. 2d 705, 710\u2013711 (1997);Statev.Nelson,96\u20130883, pp. 9\u201310 (La. App.\n12/17/97), 705 So.\u00a02d 758, 763.Given the lack of holdings from\nthis Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of\nspectators\u2019 courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot\nbe said that the state court \u201cunreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). No holding of this Court\nrequired the California Court of Appeal to apply the test ofWilliamsandFlynnto the spectators\u2019 conduct\nhere. Therefore, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or\nan unreasonable application of clearly established federal\nlaw.IIIThe Court of\nAppeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndecision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law as determined by this Court. For these\nreasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote\n1The record contains little\nconcrete information about the buttons. The buttons were apparently\ntwo to four inches in diameter and displayed only a photograph of\nStuder. It is not clear how many family members wore the buttons or\nhow many days of the trial they wore them.Footnote\n2This Court has considered\ncases in which the proceedings were a sham or were mob dominated.\nSeeMoorev.Dempsey,261 U. S. 86, 91 (1923)\n(describing allegations that \u201cthe whole proceeding [was] a\nmask\u2014that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an\nirresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts\nfailed to correct the wrong\u201d);Frankv.Mangum,237 U. S. 309,\n324\u2013325 (1915) (\u201c[T]he disorder in and about the court-room during\nthe trial and up to and at the reception of the verdict amounted to\nmob domination, that not only the jury but the presiding judge\nsuccumbed to it\u201d).",
