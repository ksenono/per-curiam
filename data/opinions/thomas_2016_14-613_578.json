    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u2013613_________________MARVIN GREEN, PETITIONERv.MEGAN J.\nBRENNAN, POSTMASTER GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the tenth circuit[May 23, 2016]Justice Thomas, dissenting.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nprohibits employers from engaging in discriminatory acts against\ntheir employees. Under a 1992 Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) regulation implementing Title VII, federal\nemployees \u201cwho believe they have been discriminated against\u201d \u201cmust\nconsult a[n] [EEOC] Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order\nto try to informally resolve the matter.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a71614.105(a)\n(2015). In particular, the aggrieved employee \u201cmust initiate\ncontact with a Counselor within 45 days of date of the matter\nalleged to be discriminatory.\u201d \u00a71614.105(a)(1).Today, the majority holds that a \u201cmatter alleged\nto be discriminatory\u201d includes a matter that is not\n\u201cdiscriminatory\u201d at all: a federal employee\u2019s decision to quit his\njob.Ante,at 5\u20136. The majority reaches this conclusion by\nadopting an atextual reading of the regulation that expands the\nconstructive-discharge doctrine. Consistent with the text of the\nregulation and history of the constructive-discharge doctrine, I\nwould hold that only an employ-er\u2019s actions may constitute a\n\u201cmatter alleged to be discriminatory.\u201d Because the only employer\naction alleged to be discriminatory here took place more than 45\ndays before petitioner Marvin Green contacted EEOC, his claims are\nuntimely. I therefore respectfully dissent.IThe meaning of a \u201cmatter alleged to be\ndiscriminatory\u201d refers to actions taken by the employer, not the\nemployee. This follows from the ordinary meaning of \u201cmatter\u201d and\n\u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d as well as this Court\u2019s precedents.AI begin with \u201c\u00a0\u2018the language [of the\nregulation] itself and the specific context in which that language\nis used.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMcNeillv.United States, 563\nU.\u00a0S. 816, 819 (2011) (brackets omitted). When a word or\nphrase is left undefined\u2014as \u201cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\u201d\nis\u2014we consider its \u201cordinary meaning.\u201dAsgrow Seed Co.v.Winterboer, 513 U.\u00a0S. 179, 187 (1995) . A \u201cmatter\u201d is\n\u201ca subject under consideration, esp. involving a dispute or\nlitigation\u201d or \u201c[s]omething that is to be tried or proved; an\nallegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 992 (7th ed. 1999); The Oxford English Dictionary 481\n(2d ed. 1989) (\u201cmatter\u201d means \u201c[a]n event, circumstance, fact,\nquestion, state or course of things, etc., which is or may be an\nobject of consideration or practical concern; a subject, an affair,\na business\u201d); seeante, at 5 (embracing this view). The term\n\u201cdiscriminatory\u201d means characterized by differential treatment that\nlacks a sound justification. See The Random House Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 564 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201cdiscriminatory\u201d means\n\u201ccharacterized by or showing prejudicial treatment esp. as an\nindication of racial, religious, or sexual bias\u201d); B. Garner, A\nDictionary of Modern Legal Usage 191 (1987) (\u201cdiscriminatory\u201d means\n\u201capplying discrimination in treatment, esp. on ethnic grounds\u201d);\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 479 (\u201cdiscrimination\u201d means characterized by\n\u201c[d]ifferential treatment; esp., a failure to treat all persons\nequally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those\nfavored and those not favored\u201d). Thus, a \u201cmatter alleged to be\ndiscriminatory\u201d means an employee\u2019s allegation that he was treated\nin an unjustifiably differential manner.In the context of employment discrimination,\nonly an employer can discriminate against\u2014or apply unjustifiable\ndifferential treatment to\u2014an employee.[1] An employee cannot plausibly be said to discriminate\nagainst himself. It therefore makes no sense to say that an\nemployee\u2019s act of quitting constitutes an action in which he was\ntreated in a differential manner that lacked a sound\njustification.And, it does not make any more sense to say that\nan employee\u2019s decision to quit is itself \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d simply\nbecause it may result from antecedent discriminatory conduct. As\ntwo of our precedents\u2014National Railroad Passenger\nCorporationv.Morgan, 536 U.\u00a0S. 101 (2002) , andDelaware State Collegev.Ricks, 449 U.\u00a0S. 250\n(1980) \u2014illustrate, the \u201cmatter alleged to be discrimina-tory\u201d is\nthereasonthe employee quit, and not the quitting\nitself.InMorgan, we rejected the argument that\na phrase similar to \u201cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\u201d\u2014namely,\nan \u201calleged unlawful employment practice\u201d\u2014\u201cconnotes an ongoing\nviolation that can endure or recur over a period of time.\u201d 536\nU.\u00a0S., at 109\u2013111. We held that discrete discriminatory acts\nof the employer occurring outside a filing period were not\nactionable, even if connected to other acts within the period.Id.,at 113. The word \u201cpractice,\u201d we explained, did not\n\u201cconver[t] related discrete acts into a single unlawful practice\nfor the purposes of timely filing.\u201dId.,at 111. The same is\ntrue of the word \u201cmatter.\u201d See,e.g.,EEOC Compliance\nManual: Threshold Issues \u00a72\u2013IV(C)(1), n. 179 (equating \u201cmatter\nalleged to be discriminatory\u201d with \u201cthe alleged discriminatory\nemploymentpractice\u201d), online at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/ threshold.html (as last visited\nMar. 29, 2016) (equating \u201cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\u201d with\n\u201cthe alleged discriminatory employment practice\u201d).RickscomplementsMorganby\nholding that discrimination occurs when an employer takes some\nadverse action against the employee, and not when the employee\nfeels the consequences of that action. 449 U.\u00a0S., at 257\u2013258.\nInRicks, we considered the timeliness of an EEOC complaint\nthat a professor filed after he was allegedly denied tenure on\naccount of his national origin.Id.,at 252\u2013254. The\nemployer offered him a contract to teach one more year after it\ndenied tenure.Id., at 255. The professor contended that his\nclaim did not accrue until his 1-year contract expired, because the\noffer of the contract constituted a \u201c\u00a0\u2018continuing\nviolation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 257. We rejected that argument\nand explained that \u201c[m]ere continuity of employment, without more,\nis insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for\nemployment discrimination.\u201dIbid.; see alsoChardonv.Fernandez, 454 U.\u00a0S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam)\n(holding that claims of administrators of the Puerto Rican\nDepartment of Education were untimely because their claims accrued\nwhen they received notice that they would be fired and not on the\neffective date of their terminations).Next PageThe alleged employer conduct that most\nimmediately prompted Green\u2019s decision to quit was the Postal\nService\u2019s request on or about December 15, 2009, that he sign a\nsettlement agreement. See App. 17, \u00b672; App. 19, \u00b683. It is\nirrelevant whether Green\u2019s decision to quit \u201cg[a]v[e] present\neffect to the past illegal act[s] and therefore perpetuate[d] the\nconsequences of forbidden discrimination.\u201dRicks,supra, at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\nthe Postal Service\u2019s December 15 request is the\u201cmatter alleged to be discriminatory,\u201d Green had\n45 days from December 15 to initiate contact with EEOC.[2] Because he was 52 days late in doing\nso, his claim was untimely.BThe majority reaches the opposite conclusion\nfor three reasons. None withstands scrutiny.First, the majority observes that the text of\nthe regulation is \u201cnot particularly helpful\u201d because the word\n\u201cmatter\u201d simply means \u201c\u00a0\u2018an allegation forming the basis of a\nclaim or defense,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which \u201ccould readily apply to a\ndiscrimination-precipitated resignation.\u201dAnte, at 5. Thus,\nthe ma-jority contends, \u201cmatter\u201d could \u201creasonably be interpreted\nto include the factual basis for a claim,\u201d which, in its view,\nincludes Green\u2019s decision to resign.Ante, at 10. But, as\nexplained, that interpretation does not grapple with the entire\nphrase, \u201cmatteralleged to be discriminatory,\u201d which does\nnot encompass the subsequent nondiscriminatory actions that the\nemployee takes.Next PageSecond, the majority contends that the\n\u201cstandard rule for limitations periods\u201d informs its understanding\nof 29 CFR \u00a71614.105.Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Under this rule, the majority contends, a limitations\nperiod does not begin to run until there is a \u201ccomplete and present\ncause of action.\u201dAnte,at 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The majority concludes thatthere is no \u201ccomplete and present cause of\naction\u201d for constructive discharge until \u201can employee resigns.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).Even assuming that an employee\u2019s resignation was\nan essential part of a constructive discharge \u201cclaim\u201d (but see Part\nII,infra) the \u201cstandard rule\u201d is merely a \u201cdefault\u201d rule.Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist.v.United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.\u00a0S. 409, 418 (2005)\n. That \u201cdefault rule\u201d does not apply, however, where\u2014as here\u2014the\ntext confirms that the limitations period begins to runbeforethe cause of action accrues.Pillsburyv.United Engineering\nCo., 342 U.\u00a0S. 197 (1952) , confirms this point. In that\ncase, the Court considered a statute that provided that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he right to compensation for disability .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nshall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year\nafter the injury.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 197 (quoting 33\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7913(a) (1952)). The Court held that the 1-year\nperiod began at the time of injury, not when the employee later\nbecame disabled as a result of the injury and concluded that\n\u201cCongress meant what it said when it limited recovery to one year\nfrom date of injury, and \u2018injury\u2019 does not mean\n\u2018disability.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 342 U.\u00a0S., at 199\u2013200. Although that\nreading meant that \u201can employee [could] be barred from filing his\nclaim before his right to file it arises,\u201d the Court refused to\n\u201crewrite the statute of limitations\u201d to avoid that result.Ibid.; see also,e.g., Doddv.United States,\n545 U.\u00a0S. 353 \u2013360 (2005) (giving effect to the clear text of\na limitations provision even though that reading \u201cma[de] it\ndifficult\u201d for certain movants \u201cto obtain relief\u201d and could lead to\n\u201charsh results\u201d).Like the limitations provision inPillsbury, 29 CFR \u00a71614.105 makes clear that the limitations\nperiod could begin before any constructive-discharge claim accrues,\nlest \u201cwhat was intended to be a limitation [be] no limitation at\nall.\u201d 342 U.\u00a0S., at 200. The regulation instructs that the\nlimitations period begins to run when the \u201cmatter alleged to be\ndiscriminatory\u201d occurs\u2014i.e.,the discriminatory conduct of\nthe employer. To say that this includes Green\u2019s resignation could\n\u201chave the effect of extending the limitation indefinitely.\u201dIbid.; see Part I\u2013A,supra.Finally, the majority downplaysMorganandRicksby claiming that Green\u2019s resignation was \u201cnot\nmerely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered;\nit is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim.\u201dAnte, at 13. \u201c[A] claim that an employer constructively\ndischarged an employee,\u201d the majority contends, \u201cis no different\nfrom a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.\u201dAnte,at 7. This reasoning cannot be reconciled with the\nregulatory text and fails to grapple with our precedents.By\nisolating Green\u2019s late response to the settlement agreement rather\nthan his employer\u2019s alleged coercion of Green to sign that\nagreement, the majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows\non Green an advantage that other employees subject to wrongful\ndiscrimination do not have. Had Green signed termination papers\nrather than settlement papers, there would be no question about the\nuntimeliness of his claims. As inRicks, the time for\nGreen\u2019s claim would have begun to run when his employer\ndiscriminated against him, even if the termination was not\neffective until months later. 449 U.\u00a0S., at 257; see alsoChardon, 454 U.\u00a0S., at 8 (same). But today, the\nmajority decides that Green\u2019s claim is different. In doing so, the\nmajority elevates constructive discharge to the status of a super\ntermination capable of extending a limitations period far beyond\nthe time the employer acted discriminatorily.IIThe majority\u2019s error is not merely one of\nregulatory misinterpretation. By misreading the regulation, the\nmajority expands the constructive-discharge doctrine beyond its\noriginal bounds. In particular, the majority cements the (mistaken)\nnotion that constructive discharge is an independent cause of\naction\u2014and not a mere counterdefense\u2014by unjustifiably focusing on\nan employee\u2019s response to an employer\u2019s conduct. See,e.g.,\nante, at 6\u201314. In doing so, the majority exacerbates the\nproblems thatPennsylvania State Policev.Suders,\n542 U.\u00a0S. 129 (2004) , first created in adopting a capacious\ndefinition of \u201cconstructive discharge.\u201dAIn holding that a discrimination claim based\non constructive discharge accrues when an employee resigns, the\nmajority wrongly assumes that constructive discharge is a separate\nclaim equivalent to an actual discharge under Title VII.Ante, at 10\u201311. But the constructive-discharge doctrine is\nbest understood as \u201ca counter-defense to the employer[\u2019]s defense\nthat the worker [voluntarily] quit,\u201d and not a separate claim.EEOCv.R.\u00a0J. Gallagher Co., 959 F.\u00a0Supp.\n405, 408 (SD Tex. 1997), vacated in part on other grounds, 181\nF.\u00a03d 645 (CA5 1999).The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)\ndeveloped the constructive-discharge doctrine in the 1930\u2019s \u201cto\naddress situations in which employers coerced employees to resign,\noften by creating intolerable working conditions, in retaliation\nfor employees\u2019 engagement in collective activities.\u201dSuders,supra, at 141; see also Shuck, Comment, That\u2019s It, I Quit:\nReturning to First Principles in Constructive Discharge Doctrine,\n23 Berkeley J. Empl. & Lab. L. 401, 406\u2013407 (2002). An employee\nwho voluntarily quit usually lost the right to backpay and other\nremedies, whereas an employee who was fired for discriminatory\nreasons did not. Seeid.,at 403. The\nconstructive-discharge doctrine enabled courts to provide a remedy\nto those employees who voluntarily quit based on the fiction that\ntheir decision to quit was not actually voluntary. Seeibid.;Suders,supra, at 147, n.\u00a08. Thus,\nas it was originally conceived, constructive discharge was not an\nindepend-ent cause of action but instead a counterdefense to an\nemployer\u2019s contention that a resignation was voluntary, and thus,\nshould \u201cfactor into the damages.\u201dKnabev.Boury\nCorp., 114 F.\u00a03d 407, 408, n.\u00a01 (CA3 1997); see alsoRussv.Van Scoyoc Assoc., Inc., 122 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n29, 35\u201336 (DC 2000) (collecting cases). So understood, an\nemployee\u2019s resignation does not complete any cause of action, and\nthus does not trigger the limitations period.The majority contends thatSudersmarked\na departure from this original conception of constructive discharge\nby \u201cexpressly h[o]ld[ing] that constructive discharge is a claim\ndistinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\u201dAnte,at\n11. But, that case does not resolve the issue one way or the other.\nTo be sure,Suderscontains a few statements suggesting that\nconstructive discharge is a claim. As the majority points out, for\nexample,Sudersstates that a hostile work environment claim\nis less \u201cgrav[e]\u201d than a \u201cclaimof hostile-environment\nconstructive discharge,\u201d and \u201ca claim for constructive discharge\nlies under Title VII.\u201dAnte,at 11 (citingSuders,\n542 U.\u00a0S., at 142, 149; emphasis added); see alsoid.,\nat 133 (referring to \u201csexual harassment/constructive discharge\nclaim\u201d);id.,at 143 (referring to \u201cconstructive discharge\nclaims\u201d). At the same time, however, the question at issue inSuderswas the availability of affirmative defenses. In that\nvein,Sudersheld only that employers could avail themselves\nof those defenses if an \u201cofficial act\u201d of the company \u201cd[id] not\nunderlie the constructive discharge.\u201dId., at 148. There are\nalso statements throughout theSudersopinion that are\nflatly inconsistent with the reading that the majority suggests.\nFor example, it points out that an employee\u2019s resignation is\n\u201cassimilated to a formal discharge\u201d for \u201cremedial purposes,\u201d\nwithout mentioning liability.Id.,at 141 (emphasis\nadded); see alsoid.,at 147, n.\u00a08 (noting that \u201ca\nprevailing constructive discharge plaintiff is entitled to all\ndamages available for formal discharge,\u201d including \u201cbackpay\u201d and\nsometimes \u201cfrontpay\u201d);id.,at 148 (\u201ca constructive\ndischarge is functionally the same as an actual termination indamages-enhancing respects\u201d (emphasis added)). In short,Sudersdoes not resolve whether constructive discharge\ndepends on the underlying discriminatory act. And, it does not hold\nthat constructive discharge is a cause of action that is distinct\nfrom the underlying discrimination claim.BThe majority today not only exploitsSuders\u2019 imprecision about whether constructive discharge is\nan independent claim, but also takes advantage of that opinion\u2019s\nambig-uity as to what an employee must establish to invoke the\ndoctrine.InSuders, I objected to the Court\u2019s\nstatement that the constructive-discharge doctrine encompasses\nthose situations in which \u201cworking conditions become so intolerable\nthat a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would have felt\ncompelled to resign.\u201dId., at 141. That description does\n\u201cnot in the least resemble actual discharge\u201d because it permits an\nemployee \u201cto allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse\nemployment action\u201d and absent any employer intent to cause a\nresignation.Id.,at 153\u2013154 (Thomas, J., dissenting).Despite theSudersCourt\u2019s overly broad\ndescription of the doctrine, the Court at least retained some focus\non an employer\u2019s conduct. The Court inSudersexplained that\nwhether to \u201cassimilat[e]\u201d a constructive discharge \u201cto a formal\ndischarge for remedial purposes\u201d entailed an \u201cobjective\u201d inquiry\nthat focused on the \u201cworking conditions\u201d themselves.Id.,at\n141. And, it held that an employer could raise certain affirmative\ndefenses to stave off liability when no official action forced an\nemployee to resign.Id.,at 147.Today, the majority goes even further thanSudersin eviscerating the limitations on the\nconstructive-discharge doctrine. The majority\u2019s rule transforms\nconstructive discharge into a claim focused on the employee\u2019s\nconduct, instead of the employer\u2019s. Green does not allege that,\nafter he signed the settlement agreement, any other act\u2014by a\nsupervisor or even a co-worker\u2014occurred or otherwise immediately\nprecipitated his decision to quit. See App. 19, \u00b6\u00b683\u201385. The\nmajority\u2019s holding\u2014that Green\u2019s claim accrued when he resigned\u2014must\nrest then on Green\u2019s own subjective feelings about the forced\nsettlement. By ignoring the date on which an employer\u2019s\ndiscriminatory act occurred and instead focusing only on an\nemployee\u2019s subjective response to that discriminatory act (seeante,at 12\u201314), the majority dispenses with the function of\nan employer\u2019s conduct. The effect of the majority\u2019s analysis, then,\nis that constructive discharge no longer involves any sort of\nobjective inquiry.I cannot agree. The concept of constructive\ndischarge is already on tenuous footing. It is not based on the\ntext of Title VII but instead on the fiction that an employee\u2019s\nresignation can be attributed to his employer in limited\ncircumstances. As initially conceived by the NLRB, this fictitious\nattribution could be justified if an employer\u2019s unlawful employment\npractice \u201cstanding alone, render[ed] an employee\u2019s\nresignation reasonable and [thus] entitle[d] the employee to\nbackpay.\u201d Shuck, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. & Lab. L., at 409\n(emphasis added); see,e.g., In\u00a0re Waples-Platter Co.,\n49 N.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 1156, 1174\u20131175 (1943) (concluding\nthat it was reasonableper\u00a0sefor the employees to quit\nin light of the nature of the employer\u2019s intentional,\ndiscriminatory transfers). Such attribution cannot be justified,\nhowever, where\u2014as here\u2014the constructive discharge accrues based\nsolely on an employee\u2019s subjective response to alleged\ndiscrimination.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because Green has not proffered any evidence\nthat discrimination continued to occur after he signed the\nsettlement agreement, his contact with EEOC was untimely under 29\nCFR \u00a71614.105. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of the Appeals.Notes1Title VII defines the\nterm \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cagent[s]\u201d of the employer. 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(b).2Title VII does not\nprovide federal employees with a cause of action for retaliation.Ante,at 3, n.\u00a01. Title VII\u2019s federal-sector provision\nincorporates certain private-sector provisions related to\ndiscrimination but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting\nretaliation in the private sector. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u201316(d) (incorporating \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20135(f\u00a0) to (k) but not\n\u00a72000e\u20133(a), which forbids private-sector retaliation). In light of\nthis text, I have grave doubts that Green\u2014as a federal employee\u2014has\na claim for retaliation. But because the parties do not raise this\nissue, and the majority leaves it open, I need not resolve\nit.",
