To ensure the accuracy\nof those submissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties\non any person who, in connection with a firearm\u2019s acquisition,\nmakes false statements about \u201cany fact material to the lawfulness\nof the sale.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(a)(6). In this case, we\nconsider how that law applies to a so-called straw\npurchaser\u2014namely, a person who buys a gun on someone else\u2019s behalf\nwhile falsely claiming that it is for himself. We hold that such a\nmisrepresentation is punishable under the statute, whether or not\nthe true buyer could have purchased the gun without the straw.IAFederal law has for\nover 40 years regulated sales by licensed firearms dealers,\nprincipally to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. See\nGun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7921 et\u00a0seq.\nUnder \u00a7922(g), certain classes of people\u2014felons, drug addicts, and\nthe mentally ill, tolist a few\u2014may not purchase or possess any\nfirearm. And to ensure they do not, \u00a7922(d) forbids a licensed\ndealer from selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable\ncause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddleston v.\nUnited States, 415 U.\u00a0S. 814, 825 (1974) (\u201c[T]he focus of the\nfederal scheme,\u201d in controlling access to weapons, \u201cis the\nfederally licensed firearms dealer\u201d).The statute establishes\na detailed scheme to enable the dealer to verify, at the point of\nsale, whether a potential buyer may lawfully own a gun. Section\n922(c) brings the would-be purchaser onto the dealer\u2019s \u201cbusiness\npremises\u201d by prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale\nof a firearm \u201cto a person who does not appear in person\u201d at that\nlocation. Other provisions then require the dealer to check and\nmake use of certain identifying information received from the\nbuyer. Before completing any sale, the dealer must \u201cverif[y] the\nidentity of the transferee by examining a valid identification\ndocument\u201d bearing a photograph. \u00a7922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the\ndealer must procure the buyer\u2019s \u201cname, age, and place of\nresidence.\u201d \u00a7922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited\nexceptions not at issue here[1]) submit that informationto the National Instant\nBackground Check System (NICS) to determine whether the potential\npurchaser is forany reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See\n\u00a7\u00a7922(t)(1)(A)\u2013(B).The statute further\ninsists that the dealer keep certain records, to enable federal\nauthorities both to enforce the law\u2019s verification measures and to\ntrace firearms used in crimes. See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th\nCong., 2d Sess., 14 (1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying\ninformation mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in its\npermanent files. See \u00a7922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer must keep\n\u201csuch records of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sale[ ] or other disposi-tion of\nfirearms .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the Attorney General may by regulations\nprescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney General (or his\ndesignee) may obtain and inspect any of those records, \u201cin the\ncourse of a bona fide criminal investigation,\u201d to \u201cdetermin[e] the\ndisposition of 1 or more firearms.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(7).To implement all those\nstatutory requirements, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms\nand Explosives (ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp.\nApp. 1\u20136. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer\nrequests his name, birth date, and address, as well as certain\nother identifying information (for example, his height, weight, and\nrace). The form further lists all the factors disqualifying a\nperson from gun ownership, and asks the would-be buyer whether any\nof them apply (e.g., \u201c[h]ave you ever been convicted\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. of a felony?\u201d). Id., at 1. Most important here,\nQuestion 11.a. asks (with bolded emphasis appearing on the form\nitself):\u201cAre you the actual transferee/buyer of\nthe firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are not the actual\nbuyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another\nperson. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer\nthe firearm(s) to you.\u201d Ibid.The accompanying instructions for that question\nprovide:\u201cQuestion 11.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer:\nFor purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/buyer if\nyou are purchasing the firearm for yourselfor otherwise acquiring\nthe firearm for yourself .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You are also the\nactual transferee/buyer if you are legitimately purchasing the\nfirearm as a gift for a third party. ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER\nEXAM-PLES: Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a firearm for Mr.\nSmith. Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the money for the firearm. Mr.\nJones is NOT THE ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm and must\nanswer \u201cNO\u201d to question 11.a.\u201d Id., at 4.After responding to this and other questions,\nthe customer must sign a certification declaring his answers \u201ctrue,\ncorrect and complete.\u201d Id., at 2. That certification provides that\nthe signator \u201cunderstand[s] that making any false .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nstatement\u201d respecting the transaction\u2014and, particularly, \u201canswering\n\u2018yes\u2019 to question 11.a. if [he is] not the actual buyer\u201d\u2014is a crime\n\u201cpunishable as a felony under Federal law.\u201d Ibid. (bold typeface\ndeleted).Two statutory\nprovisions, each designed to ensure that the dealer can rely on the\ntruthfulness of the buyer\u2019s dis-closures in carrying out its\nobligations, criminalize certain false statements about firearms\ntransactions. First and foremost, \u00a7922(a)(6), provides as\nfollows:\u201cIt shall be unlawful .\u00a0.\u00a0. for\nany person in connection with the acquisition or attempted\nacquisition of any firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer]\nknowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written statement\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. , intended or likely to deceive such [dealer] with\nrespect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other\ndisposition of such firearm or ammunition under the provisions of\nthis chapter.\u201dThat provision helps make certain that a dealer\nwill receive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a\ngun sale\u2019s legality. In addition, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) prohibits\n\u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation with\nrespect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in\nthe records\u201d of a federally licensed gun dealer. The question in\nthis case is whether, as the ATF declares in Form 4473\u2019s\ncertification, those statutory provisions criminalize a false\nanswer to Question 11.a.\u2014that is, a customer\u2019s statement that he is\nthe \u201cactual transferee/buyer,\u201d purchasing a firearm for himself,\nwhen in fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone\nelse\u2019s behalf.BThe petitioner here\nis Bruce Abramski, a former police officer who offered to buy a\nGlock 19 handgun for his uncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he\ncould get the gun for a discount by showing his old police\nidentification, though the Government contends that because he had\nbeen fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer\nauthorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew\u2019s offer, Alvarez\nsent Abramski a check for $400 with \u201cGlock 19 handgun\u201d written on\nthe memo line. Two days later, Abramski went to Town Police Supply,\na federally licensed firearms dealer, to make the purchase. There,\nhe filled out Form 4473, falsely checking \u201cYes\u201d in reply to\nQuestion 11.a.\u2014that is, asserting he was the \u201cactual\ntransferee/buyer\u201d when, according to the form\u2019s clear definition,\nhe was not. He also signed the requisite certification,\nacknowledging his understanding that a false answer to Question\n11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski\u2019s name cleared the NICS\nbackground check, the dealer sold him the Glock. Abramski then\ndeposited the $400 check in his bank account, transferred the gun\nto Alvarez, and got back a receipt. Federal agents found that\nreceipt while executing a search warrant at Abramski\u2019s home after\nhe became a suspect in a different crime.A grand jury indicted\nAbramski for violating \u00a7\u00a7922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely\naffirming in his response to Question 11.a. that he was the Glock\u2019s\nactual buyer. Abramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued\nthat his misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not \u201cmaterial to\nthe lawfulness of the sale\u201d under \u00a7922(a)(6) because Alvarez was\nlegally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed that the false\nstatement did not violate \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) because a buyer\u2019s response\nto Question 11.a. is not \u201crequired .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be kept in\nthe records\u201d of a gun dealer. After the District Court denied those\nmotions, see 778 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski\nentered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to challenge\nthe rulings. The District Court then sentenced him to five years of\nprobation on each count, running concurrently.The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit affirmed the convictions. 706 F.\u00a03d 307\n(2013). It noted a division among appellate courts on the question\nAbramski raised about \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s materiality requirement: Of\nthree courts to have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski\nthat a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial if \u201cthe\ntrue purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully purchase a firearm\ndirectly.\u201d Id., at 315 (quoting United States v. Polk, 118\nF.\u00a03d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).[2] The Fourth Circuit, however, thought the majority\nposition correct: \u201c[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a\nfirearm is a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of\na firearm acquisition under \u00a7922(a)(6).\u201d 706 F.\u00a03d, at 316.\nThe court also held that Abramski\u2019s conviction under \u00a7924(a)(1)(A)\nwas valid, finding that the statute required a dealer to maintain\nthe information at issue in its records. Id., at 317.We granted certiorari,\n571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), principally to resolve the Circuit split\nabout \u00a7922(a)(6). In this Court, Abramski renews his claim that a\nfalse answer to Question 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is\nlegally eligible to purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on\na new and more ambitious argument, which he concedes no court has\npreviously accepted. See Brief for Petitioner i.[3] In brief, he alleges that a false response\nto Question 11.a. is never material to a gun sale\u2019s legality,\nwhether or not the actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin\nwith that fundamental question, next turn to what has become\nAbramski\u2019s back-up argument under \u00a7922(a)(6), and fi-nally consider\nthe relatively easy question pertaining to \u00a7924(A)(1)(a)\u2019s separate\nfalse-statement prohibition. On each score, we affirm Abramski\u2019s\nconviction.IIAbramski\u2019s broad\ntheory (mostly echoed by the dissent) is that federal gun law\nsimply does not care about arrangements involving straw purchasers:\nSo long as the person at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the\nsale to him is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski\ncontends, irrespective of any agreement that person has made to\npurchase the firearm on behalf of someone else\u2014including someone\nwho cannot lawfully buy or own a gun himself. Accordingly, Abramski\nconcludes, his \u201cfalse statement that he was the [Glock 19\u2019s]\n\u2018actual buyer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as that term was \u201cdefined in Question 11.a.,\nwas not material\u201d\u2014indeed, was utterly irrelevant\u2014\u201cto the lawfulness\nofthe sale.\u201d Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4\n(opinion of Scalia, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police Supply\ncould legally have sold the gun to him even if had truthfully\nanswered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he was a straw\u2014because,\nagain, all the federal firearms law cares about is whether the\nindividual standing at the dealer\u2019s counter meets the requirements\nto buy a gun.[4]At its core, that\nargument relies on one true fact: Fed-eral gun law regulates\nlicensed dealers\u2019 transactions with \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201ctransferees,\u201d\nwithout specifically referencing straw purchasers. Section 922(d),\nfor example, bars a dealer from \u201csell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing]\nof\u201d a firearm to any \u201cperson\u201d who falls within a prohibited\ncategory\u2014felons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See\nsupra, at 1\u20132; see also \u00a7922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a\n\u201cperson,\u201d the dealer must take down his name, age, and residence);\n\u00a7922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a \u201cperson,\u201d the dealer must run\na background check). Similarly, \u00a7922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer\nto verify the identity of the \u201ctransferee\u201d by checking a valid\nphoto ID. See supra, at 2; see also \u00a7922(c) (spelling out\ncircumstances in which a \u201ctransferee\u201d may buy a gun without\nappearing at the dealer\u2019s premises). Abramski contends that\nCongress\u2019s use of such language alone, sans any mention of \u201cstraw\npurchasers\u201d or \u201cactual buyers,\u201d shows that \u201c[i]t is not illegal to\nbuy a gun for someone else.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 15\u201316; Reply\nBrief 1; see also post, at 2\u20136.But that language\nmerely raises, rather than answers, the critical question: In a\nstraw purchase, who is the \u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee\u201d whom federal\ngun law addresses? Is that \u201cperson\u201d the middleman buying a firearm\non someone else\u2019s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient\ncould not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the transaction)?\nOr is that \u201cperson\u201d instead the individual really paying for the\ngun and meant to take possession of it upon completion of the\npurchase? Is it the conduit at the counter, or the gun\u2019s intended\nowner?[5] In answering that\ninquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not in a\nvacuum, but with reference to the statutory context, \u201cstructure,\nhistory, and purpose.\u201d Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of divining meaning\u2014not\nto mention common sense, which is a fortunate (though not\ninevitable) side-benefit of construing statutory terms\nfairly\u2014demonstrate that \u00a7922, in regulating licensed dealers\u2019 gun\nsales, looks through the straw to the actual buyer.[6]The overarching reason\nis that Abramski\u2019s reading would undermine\u2014indeed, for all\nimportant purposes, would virtually repeal\u2014the gun law\u2019s core\nprovisions.[7] As noted\nearlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system to verify a\nwould-be gun purchaser\u2019s identity and check on his background. See\nsupra, at 2. It also requires that the information so gathered go\ninto a dealer\u2019s permanent records. See supra, at 2\u20133. The twin\ngoals of this comprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the\nhands of criminals and others who should not have them, and to\nassist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes.\nSee Huddleston, 415 U.\u00a0S., at 824; supra, at 2\u20133. And no part\nof that scheme would work if the statute turned a blind eye to\nstraw purchases\u2014if, in other words, the law addressed not the\nsubstance of a transaction, but only empty formalities.To see why, consider\nwhat happens in a typical straw purchase. A felon or other person\nwho cannot buy or own a gun still wants to obtain one. (Or,\nalternatively, a person who could legally buy a firearm wants to\nconceal his purchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal\npurposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to\nhim.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an intermediary to\nhelp him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps he conscripts a loyal\nfriend or family member; perhaps more often, he hires a stranger to\npurchase the gun for a price. The actual purchaser might even\naccompany the straw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to\nbuy, give him the money to pay at the counter, and take possession\nas they walk out the door. See, e.g., United States v. Bowen, 207\nFed. Appx. 727, 729 (CA7 2006) (describing a straw purchase along\nthose lines); United States v. Paye, 129 Fed. Appx. 567, 570 (CA11\n2005) (per curiam) (same). What the true buyer would not do\u2014what he\nwould leave to the straw, who possesses the gun for all of a\nminute\u2014is give his identifying information to the dealer and submit\nhimself to a background check. How many of the statute\u2019s provisions\ndoes that scenario\u2014the lawful result of Abramski\u2019s (and the\ndissent\u2019s) reading of \u201ctransferee\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d\u2014render\nmeaningless?Start with the parts of\n\u00a7922 enabling a dealer to verify whether a buyer is legally\neligible to own a firearm. That task, as noted earlier, begins with\nidentification\u2014requesting the name, address, and age of the\npotential purchaser and checking his photo ID. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn permits a\nbackground check: The dealer runs the purchaser\u2019s name through the\nNICS database to discover whether he is, for example, a felon, drug\naddict, or mentally ill person. See \u00a7\u00a7922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2.\nAll those provisions are designed to accomplish what this Court has\npreviously termed Congress\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d in enacting the\nstatute\u2014\u201cto curb crime by keeping \u2018firearms out of the hands of\nthose not legally entitled to possess them.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Huddleston, 415\nU.\u00a0S., at 824 (quoting S.\u00a0Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d\nSess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski\u2019s reading, the statutory terms\nwould be utterly ineffectual, because the identification and\nbackground check would be of the wrong person. The provisions would\nevaluate the eligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every\ncriminal (and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment\nand walk away with a weapon.Similarly, Abramski\u2019s\nview would defeat the point of \u00a7922(c), which tightly restricts the\nsale of guns \u201cto a person who does not appear in person at the\nlicensee\u2019s business premises.\u201d See supra, at 2. Only a narrow class\nof prospective buyers may ever purchase a gun from afar\u2014primarily,\nindividuals who have already had their eligibility to own a firearm\nverified by state law enforcement officials with access to the NICS\ndatabase. See 27 CFR \u00a7478.96(b) (2014), 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(t)(3); n.\u00a01, supra. And even when an individual fits\nwithin that category, he still must submit to the dealer a sworn\nstatement that he can lawfully own a gun, as well as provide the\nname and address of the principal law enforcement officer in his\ncommunity. See \u00a7922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward notice of\nthe sale to that officer, in order to allow law enforcement\nauthorities to investigate the legality of the sale and, if\nnecessary, call a stop to it. See \u00a7\u00a7922(c)(2)\u2013(3). The provision\nthus prevents remote sales except to a small class of buyers\nsubject to extraordinary procedures\u2014again, to ensure effective\nverification of a potential purchaser\u2019s eligibility. Yet on\nAbramski\u2019s view, a person could easily bypass the scheme,\npurchasing a gun without ever leaving his home by dispatching to a\ngun store a hired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we\nsee no reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with less-than-pure\nmotives) would put himself through the procedures laid out in\n\u00a7922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by.And likewise, the\nstatute\u2019s record-keeping provisions would serve little purpose if\nthe records kept were of nominal rather than real buyers. As noted\nearlier, dealers must store, and law enforcement officers may\nobtain, information about a gun buyer\u2019s identity. See \u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5),\n923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious crime.\nWhen police officers retrieve a gun at a crime scene, they can\ntrace it to the buyer and consider him as a suspect. See National\nShooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v. Jones, 716 F.\u00a03d 200, 204\n(CADC 2013) (describing law enforcement\u2019s use of firearm tracing).\nToo, the required records enable dealers to identify certain\nsuspicious pur-chasing trends, which they then must report to\nfederal authorities. See \u00a7923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting\nobligation when a person buys multiple handguns within five days).\nBut once again, those provisions can serve their objective only if\nthe records point to the person who took actual control of the\ngun(s). Otherwise, the police will at most learn the identity of an\nintermediary, who could not have been responsible for the gun\u2019s use\nand might know next to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Juarez, 626 F.\u00a03d 246, 249 (CA5 2010) (straw\npurchaser bought military-style assault rifles, later found among\nMexican gang members, for a buyer known \u201conly as \u2018El Mano\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nAbramski\u2019s view would thus render the required records close to\nuseless for aiding law enforcement: Putting true numbskulls to one\nside, anyone purchasing a gun for criminal purposes would avoid\nleaving a paper trail by the simple expedient of hiring a\nstraw.To sum up so far: All\nthe prerequisites for buying a gun described above refer to a\n\u201cperson\u201d or \u201ctransferee.\u201d Read Abramski\u2019s way (\u201cthe man at the\ncounter\u201d), those terms deny effect to the regulatory scheme, as\ncriminals could always use straw purchasers to evade the\nlaw.[8] Read the other way\n(\u201cthe man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm\u201d), those\nterms give effect to the statutory provi-sions, allowing them to\naccomplish their manifest objects. That alone provides more than\nsufficient reason to understand \u201cperson\u201d and \u201ctransferee\u201d as\nreferring not to the fictitious but to the real buyer.And other language in\n\u00a7922 confirms that construction, by evincing Congress\u2019s concern\nwith the practical realities, rather than the legal niceties, of\nfirearms transactions. For example, \u00a7922(a)(6) itself bars material\nmisrepresentations \u201cin connection with the acquisition,\u201d and not\njust the purchase, of a firearm. That broader word, we have\npreviously held, does not focus on \u201clegal title\u201d\u2014let alone legal\ntitle for a few short moments, until another, always intended\ntransfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U.\u00a0S., at 820. Instead, the\nterm signifies \u201ccom[ing] into possession, control, or power of\ndisposal,\u201d as the actual buyer in a straw purchase does. Ibid.\nSimilarly, we have reasoned that such a substance-over-form\napproach draws support from the statute\u2019s repeated references to\n\u201cthe sale or other disposition\u201d of a firearm. \u00a7922(a)(6); see\n\u00a7922(d) (making it unlawful to \u201csell or otherwise dispose of\u201d a gun\nto a prohibited person). That term, we have stated, \u201cwas aimed at\nproviding maximum coverage.\u201d Id., at 826\u2013827. We think such\nexpansive language inconsistent with Abramski\u2019s view of the\nstatute, which would stare myopically at the nominal buyer while\nremaining blind to the person exiting the transaction with control\nof the gun.Finally, our reading of\n\u00a7922 comports with courts\u2019 standard practice, evident in many legal\nspheres and presumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when\nidentifying the parties to a transaction. In United States v. One\n1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial Credit Co., 307\nU.\u00a0S. 219 (1939) , for example, we considered the operation of\na statute requiring forfeiture of any interest in property that was\nused to violate prohibition laws, except if acquired in good faith.\nThere, a straw purchaser had bought a car in his name but with his\nbrother\u2019s money, and transferred it to the brother\u2014a known\nbootlegger\u2014right after driving it off the lot. See id., at 222\u2013223.\nThe Court held the finance company\u2019s lien on the car\nnon-forfeitable because the company had no hint that the straw was\na straw\u2014that his brother would in fact be the owner. See id., at\n224. But had the com-pany known, the Court made clear, a different\nresult would have obtained: The company could not have relied on\nthe formalities of the sale to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018straw\u2019 purchaser\u201d when\nit knew that the \u201creal owner and purchaser\u201d of the car was someone\ndifferent. Id., at 223\u2013224. We have similarly emphasized the need\nin other contexts, involving both criminal and civil penalties, to\nlook through a transaction\u2019s nominal parties to its true\nparticipants. See, e.g., American Needle, Inc. v. National Football\nLeague, 560 U.\u00a0S. 183, 193 (2010) (focusing on \u201csubstance\nrather than form\u201d in assessing when entities are distinct enough to\nbe capable of conspiring to violate the antitrust laws); Gregory v.\nHelvering, 293 U.\u00a0S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an\nintermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes because doing\notherwise would \u201cexalt artifice above reality\u201d). We do no more than\nthat here in holding, consistentwith \u00a7922\u2019s text, structure, and\npurpose, that using a straw does not enable evasion of the firearms\nlaw.Abramski, along with\nthe dissent, objects that such action is no circumvention\u2014that\nCongress made an intentional choice, born of \u201cpolitical\ncompromise,\u201d to limit the gun law\u2019s compass to the person at the\ncounter, even if merely acting on another\u2019s behalf. Reply Brief 11;\npost, at 10\u201311. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does\nnot regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the law\nmostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a purchaser can\n(within wide limits) subsequently decide to resell his gun to\nanother private party. See Reply Brief 11. And similarly, Abramski\nsays, a purchaser can buy a gun for someone else as a gift. See\nBrief for Petitioner 26\u201327, n.\u00a03. Abramski lumps in the same\ncategory the transfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer\u2014as\nsomething, like a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the\nstatute\u2019s (purported) standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer scope.\nSee Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7\u20139.But Abramski and the\ndissent draw the wrong conclusion from their observations about\nresales and gifts. Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers\u2019\nsales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely\nuntouched. As we noted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the\ndealer the \u201cprincipal agent of federal enforcement\u201d in \u201crestricting\n[criminals\u2019] access to firearms.\u201d 415 U.\u00a0S., at 824. And yes,\nthat choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely\na result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are not a part\nof the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer\u2019s sale.\nIn claiming as much, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken\nassumption that the \u201cperson\u201d who acquires a gun from a dealer in a\ncase like this one is the straw, rather than the individual who has\nmade a prior arrangement to pay for, take possession of, own, and\nuse that part of the dealer\u2019s stock. For all the reasons we have\nalready given, that is not a plausible construction of a statute\nmandating that the dealer identify and run a background check on\nthe person to whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun.\nSee supra, at 9\u201315. The individual who sends a straw to a gun store\nto buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in every way but\nthe most formal; and that distinguishes such a person from one who\nbuys a gun, or receives a gun as a gift, from a private\nparty.[9] The line Congress\ndrew between those who acquire guns from dealers and those who get\nthem as gifts or on the secondary market, we suspect, reflects a\nhost of things, including administrative simplicity and a view\nabout where the most problematic firearm transactions\u2014like criminal\norganizations\u2019 bulk gun purchases\u2014typically occur. But whatever the\nreason, the scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides\nno reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at the point\nof sale.Abramski claims further\nsupport for his argument from Congress\u2019s decision in 1986 to amend\n\u00a7922(d) to prohibit a private party (and not just, as originally\nenacted, a licensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows\nor reasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See Firearm\nOwners\u2019 Protection Act, \u00a7102(5)(A), 100 Stat. 451\u2013452. According to\nAbramski, the revised \u00a7922(d) should be understood as Congress\u2019s\nexclusive response to the potential dangers arising from straw\npurchases. See Brief for Petitioner 26\u201327. The amendment shows, he\nclaims, that \u201cCongress chose to address this perceived problem in a\nway other than\u201d by imposing liability under \u00a7922(a)(6) on a straw\nwho tells a licensed dealer that he is the firearm\u2019s actual buyer.\nReply Brief 14, n.\u00a02.But Congress\u2019s\namendment of \u00a7922(d) says nothing about \u00a7922(a)(6)\u2019s application to\nstraw purchasers. In en-acting that amendment, Congress left\n\u00a7922(a)(6) just asit was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress\nsome-how intended to contract that provision\u2019s reach. The amendment\ninstead performed a different function: Rather than ensuring that a\nlicensed dealer receives truthful information, it extended a\nminimal form of regulation to the secondary market. The revised\n\u00a7922(d) prevents a private person from knowingly selling a gun to\nan ineligible owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:\nIt thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an individual\nwho bought a gun for himself and later decided to resell it. At the\nsame time, \u00a7922(d) has nothing to say about a raft of cases\n\u00a7922(a)(6) covers, including all the (many) straw purchases in\nwhich the frontman does not know that the actual buyer is\nineligible. See supra, at 13. Thus, \u00a7922(d) could not serve as an\neffective substitute for \u00a7922(a)(6). And the mere potential for\nsome transactions to run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause\nto read \u00a7922(d) as limiting \u00a7922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Batchelder, 442 U.\u00a0S. 114 \u2013126\n(1979).[10]Abramski\u2019s principal\nattack on his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction therefore fails. Contrary to\nhis contention, the information Question 11.a. requests\u2014\u201c[a]re you\nthe actual transferee/buyer[?]\u201d or, put conversely, \u201care [you]\nacquir-ing the firearm(s) on behalf of another person[?]\u201d\u2014is\nrelevant to the lawfulness of a gun sale. That is because, for all\nthe reasons we have given, the firearms law contemplates that the\ndealer will check not the fictitious purchaser\u2019s but instead the\ntrue purchaser\u2019s identity and eligibility for gun ownership. By\nconcealing that Alvarez was the actual buyer, Abramski prevented\nthe dealer from transacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see \u00a7922(c),\nrecording his name, age, and residence, see \u00a7922(b)(5), inspecting\nhis photo ID, see \u00a7922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identifying\ninformation to the background check system, see \u00a7922(t)(1)(B), and\ndetermining whether he was prohibited from receiving a firearm, see\n\u00a7922(d). In sum, Abramski thwarted application of essentially all\nof the firearms law\u2019s requirements. We can hardly think of a\nmisrepresentation any more material to a sale\u2019s legality.IIIAbramski also\nchallenges his \u00a7922(a)(6) conviction on a narrower ground. For\npurposes of this argument, he assumes that the Government can make\nits case when a straw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who\nis legally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us, that\nis not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a gun for\nhimself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims that a false\nresponse to Question 11.a. is not material. See Brief for\nPetitioner 28\u201330. Essentially, Abramski contends, when the hidden\npurchaser is eligible anyway to own a gun, all\u2019s well that ends\nwell, and all should be forgiven.But we think what we\nhave already said shows the fallacy of that claim: Abramski\u2019s false\nstatement was material because had he revealed that he was\npurchasing the gun on Alvarez\u2019s behalf, the sale could not have\nproceeded under the law\u2014even though Alvarez turned out to be an\neligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have\ncomplied with \u00a7922(c)\u2019s restrictions on absentee purchases. See\nsupra, at 11\u201312. If the dealer here, Town Police Supply, had\nrealized it was in fact selling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had\nto stop the transaction for failure to comply with those\nconditions. Yet more, the sale could not have gone forward because\nthe dealer would have lacked the information needed to verify and\nrecord Alvarez\u2019s identity and check his background. See\n\u00a7\u00a7922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)\u2013(C); supra, at 10\u201312. Those requirements, as\nwe have explained, pertain to the real buyer; and the\nafter-the-fact discovery that Alvarez would have passed the\nbackground check cannot somehow wipe them away. Accordingly, had\nTown Police Supply known Abramski was a straw, it could not have\ncertified, as Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was\n\u201cnot unlawful.\u201d Supp. App. 3.An analogy may help\nshow the weakness of Abramski\u2019s argument. Suppose a would-be\npurchaser, Smith, lawfully could own a gun. But further suppose\nthat, for reasons of his own, Smith uses an alias (let\u2019s say Jones)\nto make the purchase. Would anyone say \u201cno harm, no foul,\u201d just\nbecause Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under \u00a7922(d)? We\nthink not. Smith would in any event have made a false statement\nabout who will own the gun, impeding the dealer\u2019s ability to carry\nout its legal responsibilities. So too here.Abramski objects that\nbecause Alvarez could own a gun, the statute\u2019s core\npurpose\u2014\u201ckeeping guns out of the hands\u201d of criminals and other\nprohibited persons\u2014\u201cis not even implicated.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n29. But that argument (which would apply no less to the alias\nscenario) misunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier\nnoted, the federal gun law makes the dealer \u201c[t]he principal agent\nof federal enforcement.\u201d Huddleston, 415 U.\u00a0S., at 824, see\nsupra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally knowledgeable\nentity, possessing access to the expansive NICS database, which has\nthe responsibility to \u201c[e]nsure that, in the course of sales or\nother dispositions .\u00a0.\u00a0. , weapons [are not] obtained by\nindividuals whose possession of them would be contrary to the\npublic interest.\u201d 415 U.\u00a0S., at 825. Nothing could be less\nconsonant with the statutory scheme than placing that inquiry in\nthe hands of an unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be\nfamiliar with federal firearms law and has no ability to use the\ndatabase to check whether the true buyer may own a gun. And in any\nevent, keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals is not \u00a7922\u2019s\nonly goal: The statute\u2019s record-keeping provisions, as we have\nsaid, are also designed to aid law enforcement in the investigation\nof crime. See supra, at 2\u20133, 12\u201313. Abramski\u2019s proposed limitation\non \u00a7922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose because many would-be\ncriminals remain legally eligible to buy firearms, and thus could\nuse straws to purchase an endless stream of guns off-the-books.\nSee, e.g., Polk, 118 F.\u00a03d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used\nstraw purchasers to secretly accumulate an \u201carsenal of weapons\u201d for\na \u201cmassive offensive\u201d against the Federal Government).In addition, Abramski\nbriefly notes that until 1995, the ATF took the view that a straw\npurchaser\u2019s misrepresentation counted as material only if the true\nbuyer could not legally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner\n7\u20138; n.\u00a08, supra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two\ndecades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting on both\nappellate case law and changes in the statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, \u00a7103, 107Stat.\n1541 (codified at 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(t)). The critical\npoint is that criminal laws are for courts, not for the Government,\nto construe. See, e.g., United States v. Apel, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n(2014) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[W]e have never held that the\nGovernment\u2019s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any\ndeference\u201d). We think ATF\u2019s old position no more relevant than its\ncurrent one\u2014which is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the\nGovernment interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it\nsometimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in construing\n\u00a7922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its error. Here,\nnothing suggests that Congress\u2014the entity whose voice does\nmatter\u2014limited its prohibition of astraw purchaser\u2019s\nmisrepresentation in the way Abramski proposes.IVFinally, Abramski\nchallenges his conviction under \u00a7924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits\n\u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement .\u00a0.\u00a0. with\nrespect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in\nthe records\u201d of a federally licensed dealer. That provision is\nbroader than \u00a7922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that\nthe false statement at issue be \u201cmaterial\u201d in any way. At the same\ntime, \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from \u00a7922(a)(6): The\nfalse statement must relate to \u201cinformation required by this\nchapter to be kept in [a dealer\u2019s] records.\u201d Abramski notes that\nthe indictment in this case charged him with only one\nmisrepresentation: his statement in response to Question 11.a. that\nhe was buying the Glock on his own behalf rather than on someone\nelse\u2019s. And, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee\u2019s\n\u201cname, age, and place of residence,\u201d which he plausibly reads the\nindictment as not mentioning) was not required \u201cby this\nchapter\u201d\u2014but only by Form 4473 itself\u2014to be kept in the dealer\u2019s\npermanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.We disagree. Included\nin \u201cthis chapter\u201d\u2014Chapter 44 of Title 18\u2014is a provision, noted\nearlier, requiring a dealer to \u201cmaintain such records of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place\nof business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney\nGeneral may by regulations prescribe.\u201d \u00a7923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3.\nBecause of that statutory section, the information that the\nAttorney General\u2019s regulations compel a dealer to keep is\ninformation \u201crequired by this chapter.\u201d And those regulations (the\nvalidity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand that every\nlicensed dealer \u201cretain .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a part of [its] required\nrecords, each Form 4473 obtained in the course of\u201d selling or\notherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR \u00a7478.124(b). Accordingly,\na false answer on that form, such as the one Abramski made,\npertains to information a dealer is statutorily required to\nmaintain.[11]VNo piece of\ninformation is more important under federal firearms law than the\nidentity of a gun\u2019s purchaser\u2014the person who acquires a gun as a\nresult of a transaction with a licensed dealer. Had Abramski\nadmitted that he was not that purchaser, but merely a straw\u2014that he\nwas asking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a\nbackground check on, the wrong individual\u2014the sale here could not\nhave gone forward. That makes Abramski\u2019s misrepresentation on\nQuestion 11.a. material under \u00a7922(a)(6). And because that\nstatement pertained to information that a dealer must keep in its\npermanent records under the firearms law, Abramski\u2019s answer to\nQuestion 11.a. also violated \u00a7924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the Fourth Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1The principal exception\nis for any buyer who has a state permit that has been \u201cissued only\nafter an authorized government official has verified\u201d the buyer\u2019s\neligibility to own a gun under both federal and state law.\n\u00a7922(t)(3).2Compare , 118 F.\u00a03d,\nat 294\u2013295, withv, 687 F.\u00a03d 697, 700\u2013701 (CA6 2012) (a\nmisrepresentation about the true purchaser\u2019s identity is material\neven when he can legally own a gun); v, 605 F.\u00a03d 1271,\n1279\u20131280 (CA11 2010) (same).3Reflecting that prior\nconsensus, neither of Abramski\u2019s principal \u2014the National Rifle\nAssociation and a group of 26 States\u2014joins Abramski in making this\nbroader argument. They confine themselves to supporting the more\nlimited claim about straw purchases made on behalf of eligible gun\nowners, addressed , at 19\u201322.4The dissent reserves the\nquestion whether the false statement would be material if the straw\npurchaser knew that the true buyer was not eligible to own a\nfirearm. at 6, n. 2. But first, that reservation is of quite\nlimited scope: Unlike Abramski\u2019s back-up argument, which imposes\nliability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy a gun, the\ndissent\u2019s reservation applies only when the straw has knowledge of\n(or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as we will\nlater note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See , at\n12\u201313. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation)\nrests on an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a\nstraw buyer might violate \u00a7922(a)(6) if a dealer\u2019s sale to him aids\nand abets his violation of \u00a7922(d)\u2014a provision barring knowingly\ntransferring a gun to an ineligible person, see at 8, 17\u201318. But\nthat reasoning presupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the\nordinary course of business can ever have the intent needed to aid\nand abet a crime\u2014a question this Court reserved not six months ago.\nSee v, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12,\nn.\u00a08).5The dissent claims the\nanswer is easy because \u201cif I give my son $10 and tell him to pick\nup milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say that\nthe store \u2018sells\u2019 the milk and eggs to me.\u201d , at 4.But try a\nquestion more similar to the one the gun law\u2019s text raises: If I\nsend my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to\npurchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of\nthat device, am I the \u201cperson\u201d (or \u201ctransferee\u201d) who has bought the\nphone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer\neither way.6Contrary to the dissent\u2019s\nview, our analysis does not rest on mere \u201cpurpose-based arguments.\u201d\n. at 7. We simply recognize that a court should not interpret each\nword in a statute with blinders on, refusing to look at the word\u2019s\nfunction within the broader statutory context. As we have\npreviously put the point, a \u201cprovision that may seem ambiguous in\nisolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory\nscheme .\u00a0.\u00a0. because only one of the permissible meanings\nproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of\nthe law.\u201d v. , .7That reading would also,\nat a stroke, declare unlawful a large part of what the ATF does to\ncombat gun trafficking by criminals. See Dept. of Treasury, Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Following the Gun: Enforcing\nFederal Laws Against Firearms Traffickers, p. xi (June 2000)\n(noting that in several prior years \u201c[a]lmost half of all [ATF\nfirearm] trafficking investigations involved straw\npurchasers\u201d).8The dissent is mistaken\nwhen it says that the ATF\u2019s own former view of the statute refutes\nthis proposition. See at 11\u201312. As we will later discuss, see at\n21\u201322, the ATF for a time thought that \u00a7922(a)(6) did not cover\ncases in which the true purchaser could have legally purchased a\ngun himself. But Abramski\u2019s principal argument extends much\nfurther, to cases in which straws buy weapons for criminals, drug\naddicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons just\nstated, that interpretation would render the statute all but\nuseless. And although the dissent appeals to a snippet of\ncongressional testi-mony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that\nextreme view of the statute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well\nover three decades ago), ATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw\npurchases on behalf of prohibited persons.9The dissent responds:\n\u201cThat certainly distinguishes\u201d the individual transacting with a\ndealer through a straw from an individual receiving a gun from a\nprivate party; \u201cso would the fact that [the former] has orange\nhair.\u201d at 9. But that is an example of wit gone wrong. Whether the\npurchaser has orange hair, we can all agree, is immaterial to the\nstatutory scheme. By contrast, whether the purchaser has transacted\nwith a licensed dealer is integral to the statute\u2014because, as\npreviously noted, \u201cthe federal scheme .\u00a0.\u00a0. controls\naccess to weapons\u201d through the federally licensed firearms dealer,\nwho is \u201cthe principal agent of federal enforcement.\u201d v. , ; see at\n16. In so designing the statute, Congress chose not to pursue the\ngoal of \u201ccontroll[ing] access\u201d to guns to the nth degree; buyers\ncan, as the dissent says, avoid the statute\u2019s background check and\nrecord-keeping requirements by getting a gun second-hand. But that\npossibility provides no justification for limiting the statute\u2019s\nconsidered regulation of sales.10Nor\ndo we agree with the dissent\u2019s argument (not urged by Abramski\nhimself) that the rule of lenity defeats our construction. See at\n12\u201314. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies only\nif, \u201cafter considering text, structure, history and purpose, there\nremains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such\nthat the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d v.\n, 570 U.\u00a0S ___, ___ (2013) (slip op. at 26) (quoting v. , ).\nWe are not in that position here: Although the text creates some\nambiguity, the context, structure, history, and purpose resolve it.\nThe dissent would apply the rule of lenity here because the\nstatute\u2019s text, taken alone, permits a narrower construction, but\nwe have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appropriate test.\nSee, v. , ; v. , .11The\ndissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for a\nfalse answer even to an \u201cultra vires question,\u201d such as \u201cthe\nbuyer\u2019s favorite color.\u201d , at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on\nthat hypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we\nhave explained, see at 9\u201319, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but\ninstead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed,\npart and parcel of the dealer\u2019s determination of the (true) buyer\u2019s\n\u201cname, age, and place of residence,\u201d which \u00a7922(b)(5) requires the\ndealer to keep. That section alone would justify Abramski\u2019s\nconviction under \u00a7924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly\nalleged that, in addition to answering Question 11.a. falsely, he\nlied about that buyer\u2019s \u201cname, age, and place of\nresidence.\u201d",
