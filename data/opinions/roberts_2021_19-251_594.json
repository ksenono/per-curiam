The State\ncontends that having this information on hand makes it easier to\npolice misconduct by charities. We must decide whether California\u2019s\ndisclosure requirement violates the First Amendment right to free\nassociation.IThe California Attorney General\u2019s Office is\nresponsible for statewide law enforcement, including the\nsupervision and regulation of charitable fundraising. Under state\nlaw, the Attorney General is authorized to \u201cestablish and maintain\na register\u201d of charitable organizations and to obtain \u201cwhatever\ninformation, copies of instruments, reports, and records are needed\nfor the establishment and maintenance of the register.\u201d Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. \u00a712584 (West 2018). In order to operate and raise funds\nin California, charities generally must register with the Attorney\nGeneral and renew their registrations annually. \u00a7\u00a712585(a),\n12586(a). Over 100,000 charities are currently registered in the\nState, and roughly 60,000 renew their registrations each year.California law empowers the Attorney General to\nmake rules and regulations regarding the registration and renewal\nprocess. \u00a7\u00a712585(b), 12586(b). Pursuant to this regulatory\nauthority, the Attorney General requires charities renewing their\nregistrations to file copies of their Internal Revenue Service Form\n990, along with any attachments and schedules. See Cal. Code Regs.,\ntit. 11, \u00a7301 (2020). Form 990 contains information regarding\ntax-exempt organizations\u2019 mission, leadership, and finances.\nSchedule B to Form 990\u2014the document that gives rise to the present\ndispute\u2014requires organizations to disclose the names and addresses\nof donors who have contributed more than $5,000 in a particular tax\nyear (or, in some cases, who have given more than 2 percent of an\norganization\u2019s total contributions). See 26 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71.6033\u20132(a)(2)(ii)(f\u00a0), (iii) (2020).The petitioners are tax-exempt charities that\nsolicit contributions in California and are subject to the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s registration and renewal requirements. Americans for\nProsperity Foundation is a public charity that is \u201cdevoted to\neducation and training about the principles of a free and open\nsociety, including free markets, civil liberties, immigration\nreform, and constitutionally limited government.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner Foundation 10. Thomas More Law Center is a public\ninterest law firm whose \u201cmission is to protect religious freedom,\nfree speech, family values, and the sanctity of human life.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner Law Center\u00a04. Since 2001, each petitioner has\nrenewed its registration and has filed a copy of its Form 990 with\nthe Attorney General, as required by Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11,\n\u00a7301. Out of concern for their donors\u2019 anonymity, however, the\npetitioners have declined to file their Schedule Bs (or have filed\nonly redacted versions) with the State.For many years, the petitioners\u2019 reluctance to\nturn over donor information presented no problem because the\nAttorney General was not particularly zealous about collecting\nSchedule Bs. That changed in 2010, when the California Department\nof Justice \u201cramped up its efforts to enforce charities\u2019 Schedule B\nobligations, sending thousands of deficiency letters to charities\nthat had not complied with the Schedule B requirement.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity Foundationv.Becerra, 903\nF.3d 1000, 1006 (CA9 2018). The Law Center and the Foundation\nreceived deficiency letters in 2012 and 2013, respectively. When\nthey continued to resist disclosing their contributors\u2019 identities,\nthe Attorney General threatened to suspend their registrations and\nfine their directors and officers.The petitioners each responded by filing suit in\nthe Central District of California. In their complaints, they\nalleged that the Attorney General had violated their First\nAmendment rights and the rights of their donors. The petitioners\nalleged that disclosure of their Schedule Bs would make their\ndonors less likely to contribute and would subject them to the risk\nof reprisals. Both organizations challenged the disclosure\nrequirement on its face and as applied to them.In each case, the District Court granted\npreliminary injunctive relief prohibiting the Attorney General from\ncollecting their Schedule B information.Americans for\nProsperity Foundationv.Harris, 2015 WL 769778 (CD\nCal., Feb. 23, 2015); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013255,\npp.\u00a090a\u201396a. The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded.Americans for Prosperity Foundationv.Harris, 809\nF.3d 536 (2015) (per\u00a0curiam). The court held that it\nwas bound by Circuit precedent to reject the petitioners\u2019 facial\nchallenge.Id., at 538 (citingCenter for Competitive\nPoliticsv.Harris, 784 F.3d 1307, 1317 (2015)). And\nreviewing the petitioners\u2019 as-applied claims under an \u201cexacting\nscrutiny\u201d standard, the panel narrowed the injunction, allowing the\nAttorney General to collect the petitioners\u2019 Schedule Bs so long as\nhe did not publicly disclose them. 809 F.\u00a03d, at 538, 543.On remand, the District Court held bench trials\nin both cases, after which it entered judgment for the petitioners\nand permanently enjoined the Attorney General from collecting their\nSchedule Bs.Americans for Prosperity Foundationv.Harris, 182 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 1049 (CD Cal. 2016);Thomas More Law Centerv.Harris, 2016 WL 6781090 (CD\nCal., Nov. 16, 2016). Applying exacting scrutiny, the District\nCourt held that disclosure of Schedule Bs was not narrowly tailored\nto the State\u2019s interest in investigating charitable misconduct. The\ncourt credited testimony from California officials that Schedule Bs\nwere rarely used to audit or investigate charities. And it found\nthat even where Schedule B information was used, that information\ncould be obtained from other sources.The court also determined that the disclosure\nregime burdened the associational rights of donors. In both cases,\nthe court found that the petitioners had suffered from threats and\nharassment in the past, and that donors were likely to face similar\nretaliation in the future if their affiliations became publicly\nknown. For example, the CEO of the Foundation testified that a\ntechnology contractor working at the Foundation\u2019s headquarters had\nposted online that he was \u201cinside the belly of the beast\u201d and\n\u201ccould easily walk into [the CEO\u2019s] office and slit his throat.\u201d\n182 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 1056. And the Law Center introduced\nevidence that it had received \u201cthreats, harassing calls,\nintimidating and obscene emails, and even pornographic letters.\u201d\n2016 WL 6781090, *4.The District Court also found that California\nwas unable to ensure the confidentiality of donors\u2019 information.\nDuring the course of litigation, the Foundation identified nearly\n2,000 confidential Schedule Bs that had been inadvertently posted\nto the Attorney General\u2019s website, including dozens that were found\nthe day before trial. One of the Foundation\u2019s expert witnesses also\ndiscovered that he was able to access hundreds of thousands of\nconfidential documents on the website simply by changing a digit in\nthe URL. The court found after trial that \u201cthe amount of careless\nmistakes made by the Attorney General\u2019s Registry is shocking.\u201d 182\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 1057. And although California subsequently\ncodified a policy prohibiting disclosure, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11,\n\u00a7310(b)\u2014an effort the District Court described as \u201ccommendable\u201d\u2014the\ncourt determined that \u201c[d]onors and potential donors would be\nreasonably justified in a fear of disclosure given such a context\u201d\nof past breaches. 2016 WL 6781090, *5.The Ninth Circuit again vacated the District\nCourt\u2019s injunctions, and this time reversed the judgments and\nremanded for entry of judgment in favor of the Attorney General.\n903 F.3d 1000. The court held that the District Court had erred by\nimposing a narrow tailoring requirement.Id., at 1008\u20131009.\nAnd it reasoned that the disclosure regime satisfied exacting\nscrutiny because the up-front collection of charities\u2019 Schedule Bs\npromoted investigative efficiency and effectiveness.Id., at\n1009\u20131012. The panel also found that the disclosure of Schedule Bs\nwould not meaningfully burden donors\u2019 associational rights, in part\nbecause the Attorney General had taken remedial security measures\nto fix the confidentiality breaches identified at trial.Id., at 1013\u20131019.The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.Americans for Prosperity Foundationv.Becerra, 919\nF.3d 1177 (2019). Judge Ikuta dissented, joined by four other\njudges. In her view, the panel had impermissibly overridden the\nDistrict Court\u2019s factual findings and evaluated the disclosure\nrequirement under too lenient a degree of scrutiny.Id., at\n1184\u20131187.We granted certiorari. 592 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2021).IIAThe First Amendment prohibits government from\n\u201cabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of\nthe people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government\nfor a redress of grievances.\u201d This Court has \u201clong understood as\nimplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the\nFirst Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others.\u201dRobertsv.United States Jaycees,468 U.S.\n609, 622 (1984). Protected association furthers \u201ca wide variety\nof political, social, economic, educational, religious, and\ncultural ends,\u201d and \u201cis especially important in preserving\npolitical and cultural diversity and in shielding dissident\nexpression from suppression by the majority.\u201dIbid.\nGovernment infringement of this freedom \u201ccan take a number of\nforms.\u201dIbid. We have held, for example, that the freedom of\nassociation may be violated where a group is required to take in\nmembers it does not want, seeid., at 623, where individuals\nare punished for their political affiliation, seeElrodv.Burns,427 U.S.\n347, 355 (1976) (plurality opinion), or where members of an\norganization are denied benefits based on the organization\u2019s\nmessage, seeHealyv.James,408\nU.S. 169, 181\u2013182 (1972).We have also noted that \u201c[i]t is hardly a novel\nperception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups\nengaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on\nfreedom of association as [other] forms of governmental action.\u201dNAACPv.Alabama ex rel.Patterson,357 U.S.\n449, 462 (1958).NAACPv.Alabamainvolved this\nchilling effect in its starkest form. The NAACP opened an Alabama\noffice that supported racial integration in higher education and\npublic transportation.Id., at 452. In response, NAACP\nmembers were threatened with economic reprisals and violence.Id., at 462. As part of an effort to oust the organization\nfrom the State, the Alabama Attorney General sought the group\u2019s\nmembership lists.Id., at 452\u2013453. We held that the First\nAmendment prohibited such compelled disclosure.Id., at 466.\nWe explained that \u201c[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private\npoints of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably\nenhanced by group association,\u201did., at 460, and we noted\n\u201cthe vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in\none\u2019s associations,\u201did., at 462. Because NAACP members\nfaced a risk of reprisals if their affiliation with the\norganization became known\u2014and because Alabama had demonstrated no\noffsetting interest \u201csufficient to justify the deterrent effect\u201d of\ndisclosure,id., at 463\u2014we concluded that the State\u2019s demand\nviolated the First Amendment.B1NAACPv.Alabamadid not phrase\nin precise terms the standard of review that applies to First\nAmendment challenges to compelled disclosure. We have since settled\non a standard referred to as \u201cexacting scrutiny.\u201dBuckleyv.Valeo,424 U.S.\n1, 64 (1976) (per curiam). Under that standard, there\nmust be \u201ca substantial relation between the disclosure requirement\nand a sufficiently important governmental interest.\u201dDoev.Reed,561 U.S.\n186, 196 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo\nwithstand this scrutiny, the strength of the governmental interest\nmust reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First\nAmendment rights.\u201dIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSuch scrutiny, we have held, is appropriate given the \u201cdeterrent\neffect on the exercise of First Amendment rights\u201d that arises as an\n\u201cinevitable result of the government\u2019s conduct in requiring\ndisclosure.\u201dBuckley, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 65.The Law Center (but not the Foundation) argues\nthat we should apply strict scrutiny, not exacting scrutiny. Under\nstrict scrutiny, the government must adopt \u201cthe least restrictive\nmeans of achieving a compelling state interest,\u201dMcCullenv.Coakley,573 U.S.\n464, 478 (2014), rather than a means substantially related to a\nsufficiently important interest. The Law Center contends that only\nstrict scrutiny adequately protects the associational rights of\ncharities. And although the Law Center acknowledges that we have\napplied exacting scrutiny in prior disclosure cases, it argues that\nthose cases arose in the electoral context, where the government\u2019s\nimportant interests justify less searching review.It is true that we first enunciated the exacting\nscrutiny standard in a campaign finance case. SeeBuckley,\n424 U.\u00a0S., at 64\u201368. And we have since invoked it in other\nelection-related settings. See,e.g.,Citizens\nUnitedv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,558 U.S.\n310, 366\u2013367 (2010);Davisv.Federal Election\nComm\u2019n,554 U.S.\n724, 744 (2008). But exacting scrutiny is not unique to\nelectoral disclosure regimes. To the contrary,Buckleyderived the test fromNAACPv.Alabamaitself, as\nwell as other nonelection cases. See 424 U.\u00a0S., at 64 (citingGibsonv.Florida Legislative Investigation Comm.,372 U.S.\n539(1963);NAACPv.Button,371 U.S.\n415(1963);Sheltonv.Tucker,364 U.S.\n479(1960);Batesv.Little Rock,361 U.S.\n516(1960)). As we explained inNAACPv.Alabama,\n\u201cit is immaterial\u201d to the level of scrutiny \u201cwhether the beliefs\nsought to be advanced by association pertain to political,\neconomic, religious or cultural matters.\u201d 357 U.\u00a0S., at\n460\u2013461. Regardless of the type of association, compelled\ndisclosure requirements are reviewed under exacting scrutiny.2The Law Center (now joined by the Foundation)\nargues in the alternative that even if exacting scrutiny applies,\nsuch review incorporates a least restrictive means test similar to\nthe one imposed by strict scrutiny. The United States and the\nAttorney General respond that exacting scrutiny demands no\nadditional tailoring beyond the \u201csubstantial relation\u201d requirement\nnoted above. We think that the answer lies between those two\npositions. While exacting scrutiny does not require that disclosure\nregimes be the least restrictive means of achieving their ends, it\ndoes require that they be narrowly tailored to the government\u2019s\nasserted interest.The need for narrow tailoring was set forth\nearly in our compelled disclosure cases. InSheltonv.Tucker, we considered an Arkansas statute that required\nteachers to disclose every organization to which they belonged or\ncontributed. 364 U.\u00a0S., at 480. We acknowledged the importance\nof \u201cthe right of a State to investigate the competence and fitness\nof those whom it hires to teach in its schools.\u201dId., at\n485. On that basis, we distinguished prior decisions in which we\nhad found \u201cno substantially relevant correlation between the\ngovernmental interest asserted and the State\u2019s effort to compel\ndisclosure.\u201dIbid. But we nevertheless held that the\nArkansas statute was invalid because even a \u201clegitimate and\nsubstantial\u201d governmental interest \u201ccannot be pursued by means that\nbroadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be\nmore narrowly achieved.\u201dId., at 488; see alsoLouisiana\nex rel.Gremillionv.NAACP,366 U.S.\n293, 296 (1961) (quoting same).Sheltonstands for the proposition that a\nsubstantial relation to an important interest is not enough to save\na disclosure regime that is insufficiently tailored. This\nrequirement makes sense. Narrow tailoring is crucial where First\nAmendment activity is chilled\u2014even if indirectly\u2014\u201c[b]ecause First\nAmendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\u201dButton,\n371 U.\u00a0S., at 433.Our more recent decisions confirm the need for\ntailoring. InMcCutcheonv.Federal Election\nCommission,572 U.S.\n185(2014), for example, a plurality of the Court\nexplained:\u201cIn the First Amendment context, fit\nmatters. Even when the Court is not applying strict scrutiny, we\nstill require a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but\nreasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best\ndisposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest\nserved, that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means\nbut a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.\u201dId., at 218 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted).McCutcheonis instructive here. A\nsubstantial relation is necessary but not sufficient to ensure that\nthe government adequately considers the potential for First\nAmendment harms before requiring that organizations reveal\nsensitive information about their members and supporters. Where\nexacting scrutiny applies, the challenged requirement must be\nnarrowly tailored to the interest it promotes, even if it is not\nthe least restrictive means of achieving that end.The dissent reads our cases differently. It\nfocuses on the words \u201cbroadly stifle\u201d in the quotation fromSheltonabove, and it interprets those words to mean that\nnarrow tailoring is required only for disclosure regimes that\n\u201cimpose a severe burden on associational rights.\u201dPost,at\n13 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Because, in the dissent\u2019s view, the\npetitioners have not shown such a burden here, narrow tailoring is\nnot required.We respectfully disagree. The \u201cgovernment may\nregulate in the [ First Amendment] area only with narrow\nspecificity,\u201dButton, 371 U.\u00a0S., at 433, and compelled\ndisclosure regimes are no exception. When it comes to \u201ca person\u2019s\nbeliefs and associations,\u201d \u201c[b]road and sweeping state inquiries\ninto these protected areas .\u00a0.\u00a0. discourage citizens from\nexercising rights protected by the Constitution.\u201dBairdv.State Bar of Ariz.,401 U.S.\n1, 6 (1971) (plurality opinion). Contrary to the dissent, we\nunderstand this Court\u2019s discussion of rules that are \u201cbroad\u201d and\n\u201cbroadly stifle\u201d First Amendment freedoms to refer to the scope of\nchallenged restrictions\u2014their breadth\u2014rather than the severity of\nany demonstrated burden. That much seems clear to us fromShelton\u2019s statement (in the sentence following the one\nquoted by the dissent) that \u201c[t]he breadth of legislative\nabridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for\nachieving the same basic purpose.\u201d 364 U.\u00a0S., at 488; seeid., at 488, n.\u00a09 (citing sources that support this\nreading). It also seems clear from the immediately preceding\nparagraph, which stressed that \u201c[t]he scope of the inquiry required\nby [the law] is completely unlimited. .\u00a0.\u00a0. It requires\n[the teacher] to list, without number, every conceivable kind of\nassociational tie\u2014social, professional, political, avocational, or\nreligious. Many such relationships could have no possible bearing\nupon the teacher\u2019s occupational competence or fitness.\u201dId.,\nat 488. In other words, the law was not narrowly tailored to the\nState\u2019s objective.Nor does our decision inReedsuggest\nthat narrow tailoring is required only for laws that impose severe\nburdens. The dissent castsReedas a case involving only\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018modest burdens,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and therefore \u201ca correspondingly\nmodest level of tailoring.\u201dPost, at 12 (quoting 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 201). But it was only after we concluded that\nvarious narrower alternatives proposed by the plaintiffs were\ninadequate, see 561 U.\u00a0S., at 198\u2013199, that we held that the\nstrength of the government\u2019s interest in disclosure reflected the\nburden imposed, seeid., at 201. The point is that a\nreasonable assessment of the burdens imposed by disclosure should\nbegin with an understanding of the extent to which the burdens are\nunnecessary, and that requires narrow tailoring.IIIThe Foundation and the Law Center both argued\nbelow that the obligation to disclose Schedule Bs to the Attorney\nGeneral was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them.\nSee 903 F.\u00a03d, at 1007. The petitioners renew their facial\nchallenge in this Court, and they argue in the alternative that\nthey are entitled to as-applied relief. For the reasons below, we\nconclude that California\u2019s blanket demand for Schedule Bs is\nfacially unconstitutional.AAs explained, exacting scrutiny requires that\nthere be \u201ca substantial relation between the disclosure requirement\nand a sufficiently important governmental interest,\u201dReed,\n561 U.\u00a0S., at 196 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that\nthe disclosure requirement be narrowly tailored to the interest it\npromotes, seeShelton, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 488. The Ninth\nCircuit found that there was a substantial relation between the\nAttorney General\u2019s demand for Schedule Bs and a sufficiently strong\ngovernmental interest. 903 F.\u00a03d, at 1008\u20131020. Of particular\nrelevance, the court found that California had such an interest in\npreventing charitable fraud and self-dealing, and that \u201cthe\nup-front collection of Schedule B information improves the\nefficiency and efficacy of the Attorney General\u2019s important\nregulatory efforts.\u201dId., at 1011\u20131012. The court did not\napply a narrow tailoring requirement, however, because it did not\nread our cases to mandate any such inquiry.Id., at\n1008\u20131009. That was error. And properly applied, the narrow\ntailoring requirement is not satisfied by the disclosure\nregime.We do not doubt that California has an important\ninterest in preventing wrongdoing by charitable organizations. It\ngoes without saying that there is a \u201csubstantial governmental\ninterest[\u00a0] in protecting the public from fraud.\u201dSchaumburgv.Citizens for Better Environment,444 U.S.\n620, 636 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nAttorney General receives complaints each month that identify a\nrange of misconduct, from \u201cmisuse, misappropriation, and diversion\nof charitable assets,\u201d to \u201cfalse and misleading charitable\nsolicitations,\u201d to other \u201cimproper activities by charities\nsoliciting charitable donations.\u201d App. in No. 19\u2013255, p.\u00a0270\n(alteration omitted). Such offenses cause serious social harms. And\nthe Attorney General is the primary law enforcement officer charged\nwith combating them under California law. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n\u00a712598.There is a dramatic mismatch, however, between\nthe interest that the Attorney General seeks to promote and the\ndisclosure regime that he has implemented in service of that end.\nRecall that 60,000 charities renew their registrations each year,\nand nearly all are required to file a Schedule B. Each Schedule B,\nin turn, contains information about a charity\u2019s top donors\u2014a small\nhandful of individuals in some cases, but hundreds in others. See\nApp. in No. 19\u2013251, p.\u00a0319. This information includes donors\u2019\nnames and the total contributions they have made to the charity, as\nwell as their addresses.Given the amount and sensitivity of this\ninformation harvested by the State, one would expect Schedule B\ncollection to form an integral part of California\u2019s fraud detection\nefforts. It does not. To the contrary, the record amply supports\nthe District Court\u2019s finding that there was not \u201ca single, concrete\ninstance in which pre-investigation collection of a Schedule B did\nanything to advance the Attorney General\u2019s investigative,\nregulatory or enforcement efforts.\u201d 182 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at\n1055.The dissent devotes much of its analysis to\nrelitigating factual disputes that the District Court resolved\nagainst the Attorney General, seepost,at 16\u201320,\nnotwithstanding the applicable clear error standard of review, see\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a). For example, the dissent echoes the\nState\u2019s argument that, in some cases, it relies on up-front\nSchedule B collection to prevent and police fraud. Seepost,at 18\u201319. But the record before the District Court tells a\ndifferent story. See,e.g., App. in No. 19\u2013251, at\n397, 403, 417. And even if the State relied on up-front collection\nin some cases, its showing falls far short of satisfying the\nmeans-end fit that exacting scrutiny requires. California is not\nfree to enforceanydisclosure regime that furthers its\ninterests. It must instead demonstrate its need for universal\nproduction in light of any less intrusive alternatives. Cf.Shelton, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 488.The Attorney General and the dissent contend\nthat alternative means of obtaining Schedule B information\u2014such as\na subpoena or audit letter\u2014are inefficient and ineffective compared\nto up-front collection. Seepost, at 19. It became clear at\ntrial, however, that the Office had not even considered\nalternatives to the current disclosure requirement. See App. in No.\n19\u2013251, at\u00a0421 (\u201cI see no reason to change what we\u2019ve been\ndoing.\u201d). The Attorney General and the dissent also argue that a\ntargeted request for Schedule B information could tip a charity\noff, causing it to \u201chide or tamper with evidence.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 43; seepost,at 19\u201320. But again, the States\u2019\nwitnesses failed to substantiate that concern. See,e.g., App. in No. 19\u2013251, at 405\u2013406; see alsoBoard of Trustees of State Univ.of N.Y.\nv.Fox,492 U.S.\n469, 480 (1989) (\u201cthe State .\u00a0.\u00a0. must affirmatively\nestablish the reasonable fit we require\u201d). Nor do the actions of\ninvestigators suggest a risk of tipping off charities under\nsuspicion, as the standard practice is to send audit letters asking\nfor a wide range of information early in the investigative process.\nSee App. in No. 19\u2013251, at 406, 411, 418. Furthermore, even if\ntipoff were a concern in some cases, the State\u2019s indiscriminate\ncollection of Schedule Bs in all cases would not be justified.The upshot is that California casts a dragnet\nfor sensitive donor information from tens of thousands of charities\neach year, even though that information will become relevant in\nonly a small number of cases involving filed complaints. Seeid., at 307\u2013308. California does not rely on Schedule Bs to\ninitiate investigations, and in all events, there are multiple\nalternative mechanisms through which the Attorney General can\nobtain Schedule B information after initiating an investigation.\nThe need for up-front collection is particularly dubious given that\nCalifornia\u2014one of only three States to impose such a requirement,\nseeid., at 420\u2014did not rigorously enforce the disclosure\nobligation until 2010. Certainly, this is not a regime \u201cwhose scope\nis in proportion to the interest served.\u201dMcCutcheon, 572\nU.\u00a0S., at 218 (internal quotation marks omitted).In reality, then, California\u2019s interest is less\nin investigating fraud and more in ease of administration. This\ninterest, however, cannot justify the disclosure requirement. The\nAttorney General may well prefer to have every charity\u2019s\ninformation close at hand, just in case. But \u201cthe prime objective\nof the First Amendment is not efficiency.\u201dMcCullen, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 495. Mere administrative convenience does not\nremotely \u201creflect the seriousness of the actual burden\u201d that the\ndemand for Schedule Bs imposes on donors\u2019 association rights.Reed, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 196 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).BThe foregoing discussion also makes clear why\na facial challenge is appropriate in these cases. Normally, a\nplaintiff bringing a facial challenge must \u201cestablish that no set\nof circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid,\u201dUnited Statesv.Salerno,481\nU.S. 739, 745 (1987), or show that the law lacks \u201ca plainly\nlegitimate sweep,\u201dWashington State Grangev.Washington\nState Republican Party,552 U.S.\n442, 449 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the\nFirst Amendment context, however, we have recognized \u201ca second type\nof facial challenge, whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad\nif a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,\njudged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201dUnited Statesv.Stevens,559\nU.S. 460, 473 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nhave no trouble concluding here that the Attorney General\u2019s\ndisclosure requirement is overbroad. The lack of tailoring to the\nState\u2019s investigative goals is categorical\u2014present in every case\u2014as\nis the weakness of the State\u2019s interest in administrative\nconvenience. Every demand that might chill association therefore\nfails exacting scrutiny.The Attorney General tries to downplay the\nburden on donors, arguing that \u201cthere is no basis on which to\nconclude that California\u2019s requirement results in any broad-based\nchill.\u201d Brief for Respondent 36. He emphasizes that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s\nSchedule B requirement is confidential,\u201d and he suggests that\ncertain donors\u2014like those who give to noncontroversial\ncharities\u2014are unlikely to be deterred from contributing.Id., at 36\u201337. He also contends that disclosure to his\noffice imposes no added burdens on donors because tax-exempt\ncharities already provide their Schedule Bs to the IRS.Id.,\nat 37.We are unpersuaded. Our cases have said that\ndisclosure requirements can chill association \u201c[e]ven if there [is]\nno disclosure to the general public.\u201dShelton, 364\nU.\u00a0S., at 486. InShelton, for example, we noted the\n\u201cconstant and heavy\u201d pressure teachers would experience simply by\ndisclosing their associational ties to their schools.Ibid.\nExacting scrutiny is triggered by \u201cstate action whichmayhave the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate,\u201d and by the\n\u201cpossibledeterrent effect\u201d of disclosure.NAACPv.Alabama, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 460\u2013461 (emphasis added); seeTalleyv.California,362 U.S.\n60, 65 (1960) (\u201cidentification and fear of reprisalmightdeter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters\nof importance\u201d (emphasis added)). While assurances of\nconfidentiality may reduce the burden of disclosure to the State,\nthey do not eliminate it.[1]*It is irrelevant, moreover, that some donors\nmight not mind\u2014or might even prefer\u2014the disclosure of their\nidentities to the State. The disclosure requirement \u201ccreates an\nunnecessary risk of chilling\u201d in violation of the First Amendment,Secretary of State of Md. v.Joseph H.Munson\nCo.,467 U.S.\n947, 968 (1984), indiscriminately sweeping up the information\nofeverymajor donor with reason to remain anonymous. The\npetitioners here, for example, introduced evidence that they and\ntheir supporters have been subjected to bomb threats, protests,\nstalking, and physical violence. App. in No. 19\u2013251, at 256,\n291\u2013292. Such risks are heightened in the 21st century and seem to\ngrow with each passing year, as \u201canyone with access to a computer\n[can] compile a wealth of information about\u201d anyone else, including\nsuch sensitive details as a person\u2019s home address or the school\nattended by his children.Reed, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 208\n(Alito, J., concurring).The gravity of the privacy concerns in this\ncontext is further underscored by the filings of hundreds of\norganizations asamici curiaein support of the petitioners.\nFar from representing uniquely sensitive causes, these\norganizations span the ideological spectrum, and indeed the full\nrange of human endeavors: from the American Civil Liberties Union\nto the Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund; from the Council on\nAmerican-Islamic Relations to the Zionist Organization of America;\nfrom Feeding America\u2014Eastern Wisconsin to PBS Reno. The deterrent\neffect feared by these organizations is real and pervasive, even if\ntheir concerns are not shared by every single charity operating or\nraising funds in California.The dissent argues that\u2014regardless of the\ndefects in California\u2019s disclosure regime\u2014a facial challenge cannot\nsucceed unless a plaintiff shows that donors to a substantial\nnumber of organizations will be subjected to harassment and\nreprisals. Seepost,at 21, n.\u00a011. As we have\nexplained, plaintiffs may be required to bear this evidentiary\nburden where the challenged regime is narrowly tailored to an\nimportant government interest. Seesupra,at 10\u201311. Such a\ndemanding showing is not required, however, where\u2014as here\u2014the\ndisclosure law fails to satisfy these criteria.Finally, California\u2019s demand for Schedule Bs\ncannot be saved by the fact that donor information is already\ndisclosed to the IRS as a condition of federal tax-exempt status.\nFor one thing, each governmental demand for disclosure brings with\nit an additional risk of chill. For another, revenue collection\nefforts and conferral of tax-exempt status may raise issues not\npresented by California\u2019s disclosure requirement, which can prevent\ncharities from operating in the State altogether. SeeReganv.Taxation With Representation of Wash.,461 U.S.\n540, 545 (1983); see alsoSchaumburg, 444 U.\u00a0S., at\n633 ( First Amendment protects right to solicit charitable\ncontributions).We are left to conclude that the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s disclosure requirement imposes a widespread burden on\ndonors\u2019 associational rights. And this burden cannot be justified\non the ground that the regime is narrowly tailored to investigating\ncharitable wrongdoing, or that the State\u2019s interest in\nadministrative convenience is sufficiently important. We therefore\nhold that the up-front collection of Schedule Bs is facially\nunconstitutional, because it fails exacting scrutiny in \u201ca\nsubstantial number of its applications .\u00a0.\u00a0. judged in\nrelation to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.\u201dStevens, 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 473 (internal quotation marks omitted).The dissent concludes by saying that it would be\n\u201csympathetic\u201d if we \u201chad simply granted as-applied relief to\npetitioners based on [our] reading of the facts.\u201dPost,at\n25. But the pertinent facts in these cases are the same across the\nboard: Schedule Bs are not used to initiate investigations. That is\ntrue in every case. California has not considered alternatives to\nindiscriminate up-front disclosure. That is true in every case. And\nthe State\u2019s interest in amassing sensitive information for its own\nconvenience is weak. That is true in every case. When it comes to\nthe freedom of association, the protections of the First Amendment\nare triggered not only by actual restrictions on an individual\u2019s\nability to join with others to further shared goals. The risk of a\nchilling effect on association is enough, \u201c[b]ecause First\nAmendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\u201dButton,\n371 U.\u00a0S., at 433.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The District Court correctly entered judgment\nin favor of the petitioners and permanently enjoined the Attorney\nGeneral from collecting their Schedule Bs. The Ninth Circuit erred\nby vacating those injunctions and directing entry of judgment for\nthe Attorney General. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is\nreversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0Here the State\u2019s\nassurances of confidentiality are not worth much. The dissent\nacknowledges that the Foundation and Law Center \u201chave\nunquestionably provided evidence that their donors face a\nreasonable probability of threats, harassment, and reprisals if\ntheir affiliations are made public,\u201d but it concludes that the\npetitioners have no cause for concern because the Attorney General\n\u201chas implemented security measures to ensure that Schedule B\ninformation remains confidential.\u201dPost,at 15 (opinion of\nSotomayor, J.). The District Court\u2014whose findings, again, we review\nonly for clear error\u2014disagreed. After two full bench trials, the\ncourt found that the Attorney General\u2019s promise of confidentiality\n\u201crings hollow,\u201d and that \u201c[d]onors and potential donors would be\nreasonably justified in a fear of disclosure.\u201dThomas More Law\nCenterv.Harris, 2016 WL 6781090, *5 (CD Cal., Nov. 16,\n2016).",
