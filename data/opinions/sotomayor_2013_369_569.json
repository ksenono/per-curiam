She sought treatment in 1998 and 1999, but the diagnoses she\nreceived were inconclusive. By then, Dr. Cloer was experiencing\nnumbness in her face, arms, and legs, and she had difficulty\nwalking. She intermittently suffered these symptoms until 2003,\nwhen she began to experience the full manifestations of, and was\neventually diagnosed with, multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2004, Dr.\nCloer became aware of a link between MS and the Hepatitis-B\nvaccine, and in September 2005, she filed a claim for compensation\nunder the NCVIA, alleging that the vaccinations she received had\ncaused or exacerbated her MS.Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was sent by the clerk of\nthe Court of Federal Claims to the Chief Special Master, who went\non to adjudicate it. After reviewing the petition and its\nsupporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded that\nDr. Cloer\u2019s claim was untimely because the Act\u2019s 36-month\nlimitations period began to run when she first experienced the\nsymptoms of MS in 1997.Cloerv.Secretary of Dept. of\nHealth and Human Servs., No. 05\u20131002V, 2008 WL 2275574, *1, *10\n(Fed. Cl., May 15, 2008) (opinion of Golkiewicz, Chief Special\nMaster) (citing \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2) (NCVIA\u2019s limitations provision)).\nRelying on Federal Circuit precedent, the Chief Special Master also\nrejected Dr. Cloer\u2019s argument that the NCVIA\u2019s limitations period\nshould be subject to equitable tolling.Id.,at *9 (citingBricev.Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,240 F.3d 1367, 1373 (2001)). A divided panel of the Federal\nCircuit reversed the Chief Special Master, concluding that the\nNCVIA\u2019s limitations period did not commence until \u201cthe medical\ncommunity at large objectively recognize[d] a link between the\nvaccine and the injury.\u201dCloerv.Secretary of Health and\nHuman Servs., 603 F.3d 1341, 1346 (2010).The en banc court then reversed the panel\u2019s\ndecision,Cloerv.Secretary of Health and Human\nServs., 654 F.3d 1322 (2011), cert. denied, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012), and held that the statute\u2019s limitations period begins to\nrun on \u201cthe calendar date of the occurrence of the first medically\nrecognized symptom or manifestation of onset of the injury claimed\nby the petitioner.\u201d 654 F.\u00a03d,at 1324\u20131325. The Court\nof Appeals also held that the Act\u2019s limitations provision was\nnonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling in limited\ncircumstances, overruling its prior holding inBrice. 654\nF.\u00a03d,at 1341\u20131344. The court concluded, however, that\nDr. Cloer was ineligible for tolling and that her petition was\nuntimely.Id.,at 1344\u20131345.Following this decision, Dr. Cloer moved for an\naward of attorney\u2019s fees. The en banc Federal Circuit agreed with\nher that a person who files an untimely NCVIA petition \u201cassert[ing]\na reasonable limitations argument\u201d may re- cover fees and costs so\nlong as \u201c\u00a0\u2018the petition was brought in good faith and there\nwas a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was\nbrought.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 675 F.3d 1358, 1359\u20131361 (2012) (quoting\n\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1)). Six judges disagreed with this conclusion and\ninstead read the NCVIA to bar such awards for untimely petitions.Id.,at 1364\u20131368 (Bryson, J., dissenting). We granted the\nGovernment\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. 568 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012). We now affirm.IIAAs in any statutory construction case, \u201c[w]e\nstart, of course, with the statutory text,\u201d and proceed from the\nunderstanding that \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, statutory terms are\ngenerally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.\u201dBP America Production Co.v.Burton,549 U.S.\n84, 91 (2006). The Act\u2019s fees provision ties eligibility for\nattorney\u2019s fees broadly to \u201cany proceeding on such petition,\u201d\nreferring specifically to \u201ca petition filed under section\n300aa\u201311.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), (3). Section\n300aa\u201311 provides that \u201c[a] proceeding for compensation\u201d is\n\u201cinitiated\u201d by \u201cservice upon the Secretary\u201d and \u201cthe filing of a\npetition containing\u201d certain documentation with the clerk of the\nCourt of Federal Claims who then \u201cimmediately forward[s] the filed\npetition\u201d for assignment to a special master. \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). Seesupra,at 2.Nothing in these two provisions suggests that\nthe reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as its\nuntimeliness, nullifies the initial filing of that petition. We\nhave explained that \u201c[a]n application is \u2018filed,\u2019 as that term is\ncommonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the\nappropriate court officer for placement into the official record.\u201dArtuzv.Bennett,531 U.S.\n4, 8 (2000). When this ordinary meaning is applied to the text\nof the statute, it is clear that an NCVIA petition which is\ndelivered to the clerk of the court, forwarded for processing, and\nadjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a \u201cpetition\nfiled under section 300aa\u201311.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). And so long as such a petition was brought in good\nfaith and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.Ibid.If Congress had intended to limit fee awards to timely\npetitions, it could easily have done so. But the NCVIA instead\nauthorizes courts to award attorney\u2019s fees for those unsuccessful\npetitions \u201cbrought in good faith and [for which] there was a\nreasonable basis.\u201dIbid.[4]The Government argues that the Act\u2019s limitations\nprovision, which states that \u201cno petition may be filed for\ncompensation\u201d 36 months after a claimant\u2019s initial symptoms began,\n\u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2), constitutes \u201ca statutory prerequisite to the\nfiling of a petition \u2018for compensation under the Program,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 16. Thus, the Government contends, a petition\nthat fails to comply with these time limits is not \u201ca petition\nfiled under section 300aa\u201311\u201d and is therefore ineligible for fees\nunder \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). See 675 F.\u00a03d, at 1364\u20131366 (Bryson,\nJ., dissenting).The Government\u2019s argument lacks textual support.\nFirst, as noted, there is no cross-reference to the Act\u2019s\nlimitations provision in its fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e), or the\nother section it references, \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). When these two linked\nsections are read in tandem they simply indicate that petitions\nfiled with the clerk of the court are eligible for attorney\u2019s fees\nso long as they comply with the other requirements of the Act\u2019s\nfees provision. By its terms, the NCVIA requires nothing more for\nthe award of attorney\u2019s fees. A petition filed in violation of the\nlimitations period will not result in the payment of compensation,\nof course, but it is still a petition filed under\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1).[5]When the Act does require compliance with the\nlimitations period, it provides so expressly. For example,\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(2)(A) prevents claimants from bringing suit against\nvaccine manufacturers \u201cunless a petition has been filed,in\naccordance with section 300aa\u201316 of this title[the limitations\nprovision], for compensation under the Program for such injury or\ndeath.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have long held that \u201c[w]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits\nit in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate\ninclusion or exclusion.\u201dBatesv.United States,522 U.S.\n23, 29\u201330 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nabsence of any cross-reference to the limitations provision in\neither the fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), or the instructions for\ninitiating a compensation proceeding, \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1), indicates\nthat a petition can be \u201cfiled\u201d without being \u201cin accordance with\n[the limitations provision].\u201d Tellingly, nothing in \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1)\nrequires a petitioner to allege or demonstrate the timeliness of\nhis or her petition to initiate such a proceeding.[6]Second, to adopt the Government\u2019s position, we\nwould have to conclude that a petition like Dr. Cloer\u2019s, which was\n\u201cfiled\u201d under the ordinary meaning of that term but was later found\nto be untimely, was never filed at all because, on the Government\u2019s\nreading, \u201cno petition may befiledfor compensation\u201d late.\n\u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2) (emphasis added). Yet the court below identified\nnumerous instances throughout the NCVIA where the word \u201cfiled\u201d is\ngiven its ordinary meaning, 675 F.\u00a03d, at 1361, and the\nGovernment does not challenge this aspect of its decision. Indeed,\nthe Government\u2019s reading would produce anomalous results with\nrespect to these other NCVIA provisions. Consider \u00a7300aa\u201312(b)(2),\nwhich provides that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after the Secretary receives\nservice of any petition filed under section 300aa\u201311 of this title\nthe Secretary shall publish notice of such petition in the Federal\nRegister.\u201d If the NCVIA\u2019s limitations provision worked to void the\nfiling of an untimely petition, then one would expect the Secretary\nto make timeliness determinations prior to publishing such notice\nor to strike any petitions found to be untimely from the Federal\nRegister. But there is no indication that the Secretary does either\nof these things.[7]The Government asks us to adopt a different\ndefinition of the term \u201cfiled\u201d for a single subsection so that for\nfees purposes, and only for fees purposes, a petition filed out of\ntime must be treated retroactively as though it was never filed in\nthe first place. Nothing in the text or structure of the statute\nrequires the unusual result the Government asks us to accept. In\nthe NCVIA, the word \u201cfiled\u201d carries its common meaning. SeeArtuz, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 8. That \u201cno petition may be filed\nfor compensation\u201d after the limitations period has run does not\nmean that a late petition was never filed at all.Our \u201cinquiry ceases [in a statutory construction\ncase] if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory\nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u201dBarnhartv.Sigmon\nCoal Co.,534 U.S.\n438, 450 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The text of\nthe statute is clear: like any other unsuccessful petition, an\nuntimely petition brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis\nthat is filed with\u2014meaning delivered to and received by\u2014the clerk\nof the Court of Federal Claims is eligible for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees.BThe Government\u2019s position is also inconsistent\nwith the goals of the fees provision itself. A stated purpose of\nthe Act\u2019s fees scheme was to avoid \u201climit[ing] petitioners\u2019 ability\nto obtain qualified assistance\u201d by making fees awards available for\n\u201cnon-prevailing, good-faith claims.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep., at 22. The\nGovernment does not explain why Congress would have intended to\ndiscourage counsel from representing petitioners who, because of\nthe difficulty of distinguishing between the initial symptoms of a\nvaccine-related injury and an unrelated malady, see,e.g.,Smithv.Secretary of Dept. of Health and Human\nServs., No. 02\u201393V, 2006 WL 5610517, *6\u2013*7 (Fed. Cl., July 21,\n2006) (opinion of Golkiewicz, Chief Special Master), may have\ngood-faith claims with a reasonable basis that will only later be\nfound untimely.IIIThe Government offers two additional lines of\nargument for barring the award of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely\npetitions. It first invokes two canons of construction: the canon\nfavoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity and\nthe \u201c\u00a0\u2018presumption favoring the retention of long-established\nand familiar [common-law] principles.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n32 (quotingUnited Statesv.Texas,507 U.S.\n529, 534 (1993)). Similarly, the Government also argues that\nthe NCVIA should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly\nfees litigation. But as the Government acknowledges, such canons\nand policy arguments come into play only \u201c[t]o the extent that the\nVaccine Act is ambiguous.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. These \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d give way when \u201cthe words of a statute are unambiguous,\u201d as\nthey are here.Connecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain,503 U.S.\n249, 253\u2013254 (1992).Second, the Government argues that permitting\nthe recovery of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions will force\nspecial masters to carry out costly and wasteful \u201cshadow trials,\u201d\nwith no benefit to claimants, in order to determine whether these\nlate petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable\nbasis. We reiterate that \u201cwhen [a] statute\u2019s language is plain, the\nsole function of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition required\nby the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201dHartford Underwriters Ins. Co.v.Union Planters Bank,\nN.\u00a0A.,530 U.S.\n1, 6 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently,\neven if the plain text of the NCVIA requires that special masters\noccasionally carry out such \u201cshadow trials,\u201d that is not such an\nabsurd burden as to require departure from the words of the Act.\nThis is particularly true here because Congress has specifically\nprovided for such \u201cshadow trials\u201d by permitting the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees \u201cinanyproceeding [on an unsuccessful]\npetition\u201d if such petition was brought in good faith and with a\nreasonable basis, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1) (emphasis\nadded), irrespective of the reasons for the petition\u2019s failure,\nsee,e.g., Cavesv.Secretary of Health and Human\nServs., No. 07\u2013443V, 2012 WL 6951286, *2, *13 (Fed. Cl., Dec.\n20, 2012) (opinion of Moran, Special Master) (awarding attorney\u2019s\nfees despite petitioner\u2019s failure to prove causation).In any event, the Government\u2019s fears appear to\nus exaggerated. Special masters consistently make fee deter-\nminations on the basis of the extensive documentation required by\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(c) and included with the petition.[8] Indeed, when adjudicating the timeliness of a\npetition, the special master may often have to develop a good sense\nof the merits of a case, and will therefore be able to determine if\na reasonable basis exists for the petitioner\u2019s claim, including\nwhether there is a good-faith reason for the untimely filing. In\nthis case, for example, the Chief Special Master conducted a\n\u201creview of the record as a whole,\u201d including the medical evidence\nthat would have supported the merits of Dr. Cloer\u2019s claim, before\ndetermining that her petition was untimely.Cloer, 2008 WL\n2275574, *1\u2013*2, *10.The Government also argues that permitting\nattorney\u2019s fees on untimely petitions will lead to the filing of\nmore untimely petitions. But the Government offers no evidence to\nsupport its speculation. Additionally, this argument is premised on\nthe assumption that in the pursuit of fees, attorneys will choose\nto bring claims lacking good faith or a reasonable basis in\nderogation of their ethical duties. There is no basis for such an\nassumption. Finally, the special masters have shown themselves more\nthan capable of discerning untimely claims supported by good faith\nand a reasonable basis from those that are specious.Supra,\nat 12.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that an NCVIA petition found to be\nuntimely may qualify for an award of attorney\u2019s fees if it is filed\nin good faith and there is a reasonable basis for its claim.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0Justice Scalia and\nJustice Thomas join all but Part II\u2013B of this opinion.2The relevant paragraph\nprovides: \u201c(1) In awarding compensation on a petition filed under\nsection 300aa\u201311 of this title the special master or court shall\nalso award as part of such compensation an amount to cover\u2014 \u201c(A)\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and \u201c(B) other costs, \u201cincurred in any\nproceeding on such petition. If the judgment of the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims on such a petition does not award\ncompensation, the special master or court may award an amount of\ncompensation to cover petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and\nother costs incurred in any proceeding on such petition if the\nspecial master or court determines that the petition was brought in\ngood faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which\nthe petition was brought.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201315(e).3For simplicity, we refer\nto attorney\u2019s fees and costs as simply attorney\u2019s\nfees.4The en banc dissent\nreasoned that a dismissal for untimeliness does not constitute a\njudgment on the merits of a petition. See 675 F.3d 1358, 1365 (CA\nFed. 2012) (opinion of Bryson, J.). That argument is not pressed\nhere by the Government, which acknowledged at oral argument that\ndismissals for untimeliness result in judgment against the\npetitioner. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313.5The Government suggests\nthat giving the words of their statute their plain meaning would\nproduce incongruous results; notably, it might indicate that \u201ca\nfailure to comply with the limitations provision would not even bar\nrecovery under the Compensation Program itself because 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. 300aa-13 (\u2018Determination of eligibility and\ncompensation\u2019) does not expressly cross-reference the limitations\nprovision.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 18. The Government\u2019s argument\nassumes that both sections are equivalently affected by absence of\na cross-reference. This is incorrect. The Government is right that\nbecause \u201cthe law typically treats a limitations defense as an\naffirmative defense,\u201dJohn R. Sand & Gravel Co.v.United States,552 U.S.\n130, 133 (2008), a failure to apply the limitations provision\nto the section outlining the conditions under which compensation\nshould be awarded would be \u201ccontrary to [the Act\u2019s] plain meaning\nand would produce an absurd result,\u201dMilavetz, Gallop &\nMilavetz, P.\u00a0A.v.United States,559 U.S.\n229, 252 (2010). In contrast, giving the Act\u2019s fees provision\nits plain meaning would produce no such absurd result. It would\nsimply allow petitioners to recover attorney\u2019s fees for untimely\npetitions.6If the NCVIA\u2019s\nlimitations period were jurisdictional, then we might reach a\ndifferent conclusion because the Chief Special Master would have\nlacked authority to act on Dr. Cloer\u2019s untimely petition in the\nfirst place. But the Government chose not to seek certiorari from\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s en banc decision holding that the period is\nnonjurisdictional, seeCloerv.Secretary of Health and\nHuman Servs., 654 F.3d 1332, 1341\u20131344 (2011), and the\nGovernment now acknowledges that the NCVIA contains no \u201cclear\nstatement\u201d that \u00a7300aa\u201316\u2019s filing deadlines carry jurisdictional\nconsequences. See Reply Brief 7 (discussingSebeliusv.Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2013)).7Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was\npublished, and remains, in the Federal Register. See 70 Fed.
