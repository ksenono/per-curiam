S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-11206DEONDERY CHAMBERS, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[January 13, 2009]Justice Alito, with whom Justice\nThomas joins, concurring in the judgment.As I have previously explained, I\nbelieve that the Court\u2019s approach inBegay, like its\napproach in this case, \u201ccannot be reconciled with the statutory\ntext.\u201dBegayv.United States, 553 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 1) (dissenting opinion). I nonetheless\nrecognize that \u201cstare decisisin respect to statutory\ninterpretation has \u2018special force,\u2019\u00a0\u201dJohn R. Sand &\nGravel Co.v.United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 8), and I am sympathetic to the majority\u2019s\nefforts to provide a workable interpretation of the \u201cresidual\nclause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), while retaining\nthe \u201ccategorical approach\u201d that we adopted inTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575, 602\n(1990). In light ofTaylorandBegay, I agree\nthat this case should be remanded for resentencing. I write\nseparately, however, to emphasize that only Congress can rescue the\nfederal courts from the mire into which ACCA\u2019s draftsmanship andTaylor\u2019s \u201ccategorical approach\u201d have pushed us.In 1986, when Congress enacted ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), few could have foreseen\nthe difficulties that lay ahead.[Footnote 1] Only four months before Congress framed the\nresidual clause, this Court upheld a state sentencing provision\nthat imposed a mandatory minimum sentence where the judge found by\na preponderance of the evidence that the defendant visibly\npossessed a firearm during the commission of certain felonies\n(including robbery). SeeMcMillanv.Pennsylvania,477 U. S. 79(1986).\nLegislating against the background ofMcMillan, Congress\nmay have assumed that ACCA\u2019s residual clause would similarly\nrequire federal sentencing judges to determine whether the\nparticular facts of a particular case triggered a mandatory minimum\nsentence.But history took a different track. InTaylor, the Court held that ACCA requires \u201cthe sentencing\ncourt to look only to the fact that the defendant had been\nconvicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to\nthe facts underlying the prior convictions.\u201d 495 U. S., at 600.\nThus, we held that sentencing judges should apply a \u201ccategorical\napproach\u201d to determine whether an underlying state offense meets\nthe \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary that this Court\u2014not\nCongress\u2014created.Id., at 598. The Court justified its\ndecision with a 10-page discussion of ACCA\u2019s purpose and\nlegislative history,id., at 581\u2013590; see alsoid., at 603 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (criticizing the Court\u2019s approach), and explained that\nits conclusion was necessary to undo \u201can inadvertentcasualty [in ACCA\u2019s] complex drafting process,\u201did.,\nat 589\u2013590.ACCA\u2019s clarity has been the true\ninadvertent casualty. After almost two decades withTaylor\u2019s \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d only one thing is clear:\nACCA\u2019s residual clause is nearly impossible to apply consistently.\nIndeed, the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to predicate offenses has\ncreated numerous splits among the lower federal courts,[Footnote 2] the resolution of which\ncould occupy this Court for years. What is worse is that each new\napplication of the residual clause seems to lead us further and\nfurther away from the statutory text. Today\u2019s decision, for\nexample, turns on little more than a statistical analysis of a\nresearch report prepared by the United States Sentencing\nCommission.Ante, at 6\u20137; 10 (App. B).At this point, the only tenable,\nlong-term solution is for Congress to formulate a specific list of\nexpressly defined crimes that are deemed to be worthy of ACCA\u2019s\nsentencing enhancement. That is the approach that Congress took in\n1984, when it applied ACCA to two enumerated and expressly defined\nfelonies. See n.\u00a01,supra. And that approach is the\nonly way to right ACCA\u2019s ship.Footnote 1Congress originally enacted ACCA\nin 1984. See \u00a71802, 93 Stat. 2185, 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0App.\n\u00a71202(a) (1982 ed. and Supp. II) (repealed in 1986 by Firearms\nOwner\u2019s Protection Act, \u00a7104(b), 100 Stat. 459). That statute,\nhowever, applied a mandatory sentencing enhancement to only two\npredicate felonies\u2014robbery and burglary\u2014which the statute expressly\ndefined. 18 U. S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a7\u00a71202(c)(8)\u2013(9) (1982 ed., Supp.\nII). Congress did not add the undefined \u201cotherwise clause\u201d until\n1986. See Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402, 100 Stat.\n3207\u201339.Footnote 2For example, the lower courts\nhave split over whether it is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA\u2019s\nresidual clause to commit rape, compareUnited Statesv.Sawyers, 409 F.\u00a03d 732 (CA6 2005) (statutory rape not\ncategorically violent), withUnited Statesv.Williams, 120 F.\u00a03d 575 (CA5 1997) (inducement of\nminor to commit sodomy violent), andUnited Statesv.Thomas, 231 Fed. Appx. 765 (CA9 2007) (all rape violent);\nretaliate against a government officer, compareUnited\nStatesv.Montgomery, 402 F.\u00a03d 482 (CA5 2005)\n(not violent), withSawyers,supra(violent);\nattempt or conspire to commit burglary, compareUnited\nStatesv.Fell, 511 F.\u00a03d 1035 (CA10 2007) (even\nafterJamesv.United States,550 U. S. 192(2007),\nand even where statute requires an overt act, conspiracy to commit\nburglary not violent), withUnited Statesv.Moore, 108 F.\u00a03d 878 (CA8 1997) (attempted burglary\nviolent if statute requires proof of overt act); carry a concealed\nweapon, compareUnited Statesv.Whitfield, 907\nF.\u00a02d 798 (CA8 1990) (not violent), withUnited\nStatesv.Hall, 77 F.\u00a03d 398 (CA11 1996)\n(violent); and possess a sawed-off shotgun as a felon, compareUnited Statesv.Amos, 501 F.\u00a03d 524 (CA6\n2007) (not violent), withUnited Statesv.Bishop, 453 F.\u00a03d 30 (CA1 2006) (violent).
