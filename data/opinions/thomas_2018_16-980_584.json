    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u2013980_________________JON HUSTED, OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE,\nPETITIONERv.A. PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 11, 2018]Thomas, J., concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion in full. I write\nseparately to add that respondents\u2019 proposed interpretation of the\nNational Voter Registration Act (NVRA) should also be rejected\nbecause it would raise significant constitutional concerns.Respondents would interpret the NVRA to prevent\nStates from using failure to vote as evidence when deciding whether\ntheir voting qualifications have been satisfied. Brief for\nRespondents 25\u201330. The Court\u2019s opinion explains why that reading is\ninconsistent with the text of the NVRA. Seeante,at 7\u201318.\nBut even if the NVRA were \u201csusceptible\u201d to respondents\u2019 reading, it\ncould not prevail because it \u201craises serious constitutional doubts\u201d\nthat the Court\u2019s interpretation avoids.Jenningsv.Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at\n2).As I have previously explained, constitutional\ntext and history both \u201cconfirm that States have the exclusive\nauthority to set voter qualifications and to determine whether\nthose qualifications are satisfied.\u201dArizonav.Inter\nTribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.\u00a0S. 1, 29 (2013)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). The Voter-Qualifications Clause provides\nthat, in elections for the House of Representatives, \u201cthe Electors\nin each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors\nof the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\u201d U.\u00a0S.\nConst., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a72, cl.\u00a01. The Seventeenth Amendment\nimposes an identical requirement for elections of Senators. And the\nConstitution recognizes the authority of States to \u201cappoint\u201d\nPresidential electors \u201cin such Manner as the Legislature thereof\nmay direct.\u201d Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a02; seeInter Tribal\nCouncil of Ariz., 570 U.\u00a0S., at 35, n.\u00a02 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). States thus retain the authority to decide the\nqualifications to vote in federal elections, limited only by the\nrequirement that they not \u201c\u00a0\u2018establish special\nrequirements\u2019\u00a0\u201d for congressional elections \u201c\u00a0\u2018that do\nnot apply in elections for the state legislature.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 26 (quotingU.\u00a0S. Term Limits, Inc.v.Thornton, 514 U.\u00a0S. 779, 865 (1995) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting)). And because the power to establish requirements would\nmean little without the ability to enforce them, the Voter\nQualifications Clause also \u201cgives States the authority\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to verify whether [their] qualifications are\nsatisfied.\u201d 570 U.\u00a0S., at 28.Respondents\u2019 reading of the NVRA would seriously\ninterfere with the States\u2019 constitutional authority to set and\nenforce voter qualifications. To vote in Ohio, electors must have\nbeen a state resident 30 days before the election, as well as a\nresident of the county and precinct where they vote. Ohio Rev. Code\nAnn. \u00a73503.01(A) (Lexis 2015); see also Ohio Const., Art.\u00a0V,\n\u00a71. Ohio uses a record of nonvoting as one piece of evidence that\nvoters no longer satisfy the residence requirement. Reading the\nNVRA to bar Ohio from considering nonvoting would therefore\ninterfere with the State\u2019s \u201cauthority to verify\u201d that its\nqualifications are met \u201cin the way it deems necessary.\u201dInter\nTribal Council of Ariz.,supra,at 36. Respondents\u2019\nreading thus renders the NVRA constitutionally suspect and should\nbe disfavored. SeeJennings,supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2).Respondents counter that Congress\u2019 power to\nregulate the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of holding congressional\nelections includes the power to impose limits on the evidence that\na State may consider when maintaining its voter rolls. See Brief\nfor Respondents 51\u201355; see also Art.\u00a0I, \u00a74, cl.\u00a01 (\u201cThe\nTimes, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and\nRepresentatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the\nLegislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make\nor alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing\nSenators\u201d). But, as originally understood, the Times, Places and\nManner Clause grants Congress power \u201conly over the \u2018when, where,\nand how\u2019 of holding congressional elections,\u201d not over the question\nof who can vote.Inter Tribal Council of Ariz.,supra,at 29 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (quoting T. Parsons,\nNotes of Convention Debates, Jan. 16, 1788, in 6 Documentary\nHistory of the Ratification of the Constitution 1211 (J. Kaminski\n& G. Saladino eds. 2000) (Massachusetts ratification delegate\nSedgwick)). The \u201c\u00a0\u2018Manner of holding Elections\u2019\u00a0\u201d was\nunderstood to refer to \u201cthe circumstances under which elections\nwere held and the mechanics of the actual election.\u201d 570\nU.\u00a0S., at 30 (quoting Art.\u00a0I, \u00a74, cl.\u00a01). It does\nnot give Congress the authority to displace state voter\nqualifications or dictate what evidence a State may consider in\ndeciding whether those qualifications have been met. See 570\nU.\u00a0S., at 29\u201333. The Clause thus does not change the fact that\nrespondents\u2019 reading of the NVRA is constitutionally suspect.The Court\u2019s interpretation of the NVRA was\nalready the correct reading of the statute: The NVRA does not\nprohibit a State from considering failure to vote as evidence that\na registrant has moved. The fact that this reading avoids serious\nconstitutional problems is an additional reason why, in my view,\ntoday\u2019s decision is undoubtedly correct.",
