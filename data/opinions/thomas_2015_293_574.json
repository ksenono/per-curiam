I write separately to\nexpress my concern about the Court\u2019s eagerness to reach beyond the\nbounds of the present dispute to create a timing requirement that\nfinds no support in the text or structure of the statute. We have\nbeen unwilling to impose procedural requirements on federal\nagencies in the absence of statutory command, even while\nrecognizing that an agency\u2019s failure to make its decisions known at\nthe time it acts may burden regulated parties. See,e.g.,\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporationv.LTV Corp.,496\nU.\u00a0S. 633\u2013655 (1990). When a State vests its municipalities\nwith authority to exercise a core state power, those municipalities\ndeserve at least as much respect as a fed-eral agency. But today,\nthe majority treats them as less than conscripts in \u201cthe national\nbureaucratic army,\u201dFERCv.Mississippi,456\nU.\u00a0S. 742,775 (1982) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). I respectfully dissent.",
