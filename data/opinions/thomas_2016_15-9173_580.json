The Court today\ncorrectly observes that our decision inPaynev.Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808 (1991) , did not expressly\noverrule this aspect ofBooth. Because \u201cit is this Court\u2019s\nprerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents,\u201dState Oil\nCo.v.Khan, 522 U.\u00a0S. 3, 20 (1997) , the Oklahoma\nCourt of Criminal Appeals erred in holding thatPayneinvalidatedBoothin its entirety. In vacating the decision\nbelow, this Court says nothing about whetherBoothwas\ncorrectly decided or whetherPayneswept away its analytical\nfoundations. I join the Court\u2019s opinion with this\nunderstanding.",
