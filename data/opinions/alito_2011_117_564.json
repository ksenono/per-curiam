    "text": "OPINION OF ALITO, J.NEVADA COMM'N ON ETHICS V. CARRIGAN564 U. S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 10-568NEVADA COMMISSION ON ETHICS, PETITIONERv.MICHAEL A. CARRIGANon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nnevada[June 13, 2011]Justice Alito, concurring in part\nand concurring in the judgment.I concur in the judgment, but I\ndo not agree with the opinion of the Court insofar as it suggests\nthat restrictions upon legislators\u2019 voting are not restrictions\nupon legislators\u2019 speech.Ante, at 8. As respondent notes,\n\u201c[o]ur history is rich with tales of legislators using their votes\nto express deeply held and highly unpopular views, often at great\npersonal or political peril.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. To\nillustrate this point, respondent notes, among other famous\nincidents, John Quincy Adams\u2019 vote in favor of the Embargo Act of\n1807, a vote that is said to have cost him his Senate seat, and Sam\nHouston\u2019s vote against the Kansas-Nebraska Act, a vote that was\ndeeply unpopular in the South.Id., at 23\u201324 (citing J.\nKennedy, Profiles in Courage 48, 109 (commemorative ed. 1991)).In response to respondent\u2019s argument, the\nCourt suggests that the \u201cexpressive value\u201d of such votes is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that\naccompanies it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 9. This suggestion,\nhowever, is surely wrong. If John Quincy Adams and Sam Houston had\ndone no more than cast the votes in question, their votes would\nstill have spoken loudly and clearly to everyone who was interested\nin the bills in question. Voting has an expressive component in and\nof itself. The Court\u2019s strange understanding of the concept of\nspeech is shown by its suggestion that the symbolic act of burning\nthe American flag is speech but John Quincy Adams calling out \u201cyea\u201d\non the Embargo Act was not.Ibid.*A legislative vote is not speech, the Court\ntells us, because the vote may express, not the legislator\u2019s\nsincere personal view, but simply the view that is favored by the\nlegislator\u2019s constituents. Seeibid. But the same is\nsometimes true of legislators\u2019 speeches.Not only is the Court incorrect in its\nanalysis of the expressive character of voting, but the Court\u2019s\nposition is inconsistent with our reasoning just last Term inDoev.Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). There,\nrespondents argued that \u201csigning a petition is a legally operative\nlegislative act and therefore \u2018does not involve any significant\nexpressive element.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Brief for Respondent Reed 31). But the Court rejected this\nargument, stating:\u201cIt is true that signing a referendum petition may\nultimately have the legal consequence of requiring the secretary of\nstate to place the referendum on the ballot. But we do not see how\nadding such legal effect to an expressive activity somehow deprives\nthat activity of its expressive component, taking it outside the\nscope of the First Amendment.\u201d 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n6).But cf.id., at ___\n(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1) (\u201cI doubt\nwhether signing a petition that has the effect of suspending a law\nfits within \u2018the freedom of speech\u2019 at all\u201d).Our reasoning inReedis applicable\nhere. Just as the act of signing a petition is not deprived of its\nexpressive character when the signature is given legal\nconsequences, the act of voting is not drained of its expressive\ncontent when the vote has a legal effect. If an ordinary citizen\ncasts a vote in a straw poll on an important proposal pending\nbefore a legislative body, that act indisputably constitutes a form\nof speech. If a member of the legislative body chooses to vote in\nthe same straw poll, the legislator\u2019s act is no less expressive\nthan that of an ordinary citizen. And if the legislator then votes\non the measure in the legislative chamber, the expressive character\nof that vote is not eliminated simply because it may affect the\noutcome of the legislative process.In Part III of its opinion, the Court\ndemonstrates that legislative recusal rules were not regarded\nduring the founding era asimpermissiblerestrictions on\nfreedom of speech. On that basis, I agree that the judgment below\nmust be reversed.*\u00a0See 17 Annals of Congress 50 (1807); see\nalso 15id., at 201 (1806).",
