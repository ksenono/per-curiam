In my view, Texas\u2019 failure to timely obtain \u00a75\npreclearance of its new plans is no obstacle to their\nimplementation, because, as I have previously explained, \u00a75 is\nunconstitutional. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U.\u00a0S. 193, 212 (2009) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Although\nTexas\u2019 new plans are being challenged on the grounds that they\nviolate the Federal Constitution and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act,\nthey have not yet been found to violate any law. Accordingly,\nTexas\u2019 duly enacted redistricting plans should govern the upcoming\nelections. I would therefore vacate the interim orders and remand\nfor the United States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas to consider appellees\u2019 constitutional and \u00a72 challenges in\nthe ordinary course.",
