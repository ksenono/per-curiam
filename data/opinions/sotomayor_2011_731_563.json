ASHCROFT, PETITIONERv.ABDULLAH\nal-KIDDon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[May 31, 2011]Justice Sotomayor, with whom\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring in the\njudgment.I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment\nreversing the Court of Appeals because I agree with the majority\u2019s\nconclusion that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law. I\ncannot join the majority\u2019s opinion, however, because it\nunnecessarily \u201cresolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n] of\nconstitutional \u2026 interpretation that will \u2018have no effect on the\noutcome of the case.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 3 (quotingPearsonv.Callahan,555 U. S. 223, 237\n(2009)).Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the\npretextual use of a material witness warrant for preventive\ndetention of an individual whom the Government has no intention of\nusing at trial is, in my view, a closer question than the\nmajority\u2019s opinion suggests. Although the majority is correct that\na government official\u2019s subjective intent is generally \u201cirrelevant\nin determining whether that officer\u2019s actions violate the Fourth\nAmendment,\u201dBondv.United States,529 U. S. 334, 338,\nn.\u00a02 (2000), none of our prior cases recognizing that\nprinciple involved prolonged detention of an individual without\nprobable cause to believe he had committed any criminal offense. We\nhave never considered whether an official\u2019s subjective intent\nmatters for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel context,\nand we need not and should not resolve that question in this case.\nAll Members of the Court agree that, whatever the merits of the\nunderlying Fourth Amendment question, Ashcroft did not violate\nclearly established law.The majority\u2019s constitutional ruling is a\nnarrow one pre-mised on the existence of a \u201cvalid material-witness\nwarran[t],\u201dante, at 1\u2014a premise that, at the very least,\nis questionable in light of the allegations set forth in al-Kidd\u2019s\ncomplaint. Based on those allegations, it is not at all clear that\nit would have been \u201cimpracticable to secure [al-Kidd\u2019s] presence \u2026\nby subpoena\u201d or that his testimony could not \u201cadequately be secured\nby deposition.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73144; see First Amended Complaint\nin No. 05\u2013093\u2013EJL, \u00b655, App. 26 (\u201cMr. al-Kidd would have complied\nwith a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a deposition\u201d).\nNor is it clear that the affidavit supporting the warrant was\nsufficient; its failure to disclose that the Government had no\nintention of using al-Kidd as a witness at trial may very well have\nrendered the affidavit deliberately false and misleading. Cf.Franksv.Delaware,438 U. S. 154, 155\u2013156\n(1978). The majority assumes away these factual difficulties, but\nin my view, they point to the artificiality of the way the Fourth\nAmendment question has been presented to this Court and provide\nfurther reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding on the\nconstitutional question.I also join Part I of Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurring opinion. As that opinion makes clear, this case does not\npresent an occasion to address the proper scope of the material\nwitness statute or its constitutionality as applied in this case.\nIndeed, nothing in the majority\u2019s opinion today should be read as\nplacing this Court\u2019s imprimatur on the actions taken by the\nGovernment against al-Kidd.Ante, at 1 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cThe Court\u2019s holding is limited to the arguments\npresented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the\nGovernment\u2019s use of the Material Witness Statute in this case was\nlawful\u201d).",
