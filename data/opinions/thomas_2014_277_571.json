GINA FIORE\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[February 25, 2014]Justice Thomas\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.This case asks us to\ndecide whether a court in Nevada may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover a defendant on the basis that he knew his allegedly tortious\nconduct in Georgia would delay the return of funds to plaintiffs\nwith connections to Nevada. Because the defendant had no other\ncontacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff\u2019s con-tacts with the\nforum State cannot be \u201cdecisive in determining whether the\ndefendant\u2019s due process rights are violated,\u201d Rush v. Savchuk, 444\nU.\u00a0S. 320, 332 (1980) , we hold that the court in Nevada may\nnot exercise personal jurisdiction under these circumstances.IPetitioner Anthony\nWalden serves as a police officer for the city of Covington,\nGeorgia. In August 2006, petitioner was working at the Atlanta\nHartsfield-Jackson Airport as a deputized agent of the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA). As part of a task force,\npetitioner conducted investigative stops and other law enforcement\nfunctions in support of the DEA\u2019s airport drug interdiction\nprogram.On August 8, 2006,\nTransportation Security Administration agents searched respondents\nGina Fiore and Keith Gipson and their carry-on bags at the San Juan\nairport in Puerto Rico. They found almost $97,000 in cash. Fiore\nexplained to DEA agents in San Juan that she and Gipson had been\ngambling at a casino known as the El San Juan, and that they had\nresidences in both California and Nevada (though they provided only\nCalifornia identification). After respondents were cleared for\ndeparture, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport\nnotified petitioner\u2019s task force in Atlanta that respondents had\nboarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to catch a\nconnecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.When respondents\narrived in Atlanta, petitioner and another DEA agent approached\nthem at the departure gate for their flight to Las Vegas. In\nresponse to petitioner\u2019s questioning, Fiore explained that she and\nGipson were professional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the\ncash they were carrying was their gambling \u201c\u00a0\u2018bank\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\nwinnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to perform a\nsniff test, petitioner seized the cash.[1] Petitioner advised respondents that their funds would\nbe returned if they later proved a legitimate source for the cash.\nRespondents then boarded their plane.After respondents\ndeparted, petitioner moved the cash to a secure location and the\nmatter was forwarded to DEA headquarters. The next day, petitioner\nreceived a phone call from respondents\u2019 attorney in Nevada seeking\nreturn of the funds. On two occasions over the next month,\npetitioner also received documentation from the attorney regarding\nthe legitimacy of the funds.At some point after\npetitioner seized the cash, he helped draft an affidavit to show\nprobable cause for forfeiture of the funds and forwarded that\naffidavit to a United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia.[2] According to respondents, the\naffidavit was false and misleading because petitioner\nmisrepresented the encounter at the airport and omitted exculpatory\ninformation regarding the lack of drug evidence and the legitimate\nsource of the funds. In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed,\nand the DEA returned the funds to respondents in March 2007.Respondents filed suit\nagainst petitioner in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Nevada, seeking money damages under Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971) .\nRespondents alleged that petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights by (1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping\nthe money after concluding it did not come from drug-related\nactivity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable cause affidavit to\nsupport a forfeiture action while knowing the affidavit contained\nfalse statements; (4) willfully seeking forfeiture while\nwithholding exculpatory informa-tion; and (5) withholding that\nexculpatory information from the United States Attorney\u2019s\nOffice.The District Court\ngranted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. Relying on this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Calder v. Jones, 465 U.\u00a0S. 783 (1984) , the court\ndetermined that petitioner\u2019s search of respondents and his seizure\nof the cash in Georgia did not establish a basis to exercise\npersonal jurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if\npetitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while knowing they\nlived in Nevada, that fact alone did not confer jurisdiction.\nBecause the court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal\njurisdiction, it did not determine whether venue was proper.On appeal, a divided\npanel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nreversed. The Court of Appeals assumed the District Court had\ncorrectly determined that petitioner\u2019s search and seizure in\nGeorgia could not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada. The\ncourt held, however, that the District Court could properly\nexercise jurisdiction over \u201cthe false probable cause affidavit\naspect of the case.\u201d 688 F.\u00a03d 558, 577 (2011). According to\nthe Court of Appeals, petitioner \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d his submission\nof the allegedly false affidavit at Nevada by submitting the\naffidavit with knowledge that it would affect persons with a\n\u201csignificant connection\u201d to Nevada.[3] Id., at 581. After determining that the delay in\nreturning the funds to respondents caused them \u201cforeseeable harm\u201d\nin Nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over\npetitioner was otherwise reasonable, the court found the District\nCourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction to be proper.[4] Id., at 582, 585. The Ninth Circuit\ndenied rehearing en banc, with eight judges, in two separate\nopinions, dissenting. Id., at 562, 568.We granted certiorari\nto decide whether due process permits a Nevada court to exercise\njurisdiction over petitioner. 568 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013). We hold\nthat it does not and therefore reverse.[5]IIA\u201cFederal courts\nordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their\njurisdiction over persons.\u201d Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6). This is because a federal\ndistrict court\u2019s authority to assert personal jurisdiction in most\ncases is linked to service of process on a defendant \u201cwho is\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in\nthe state where the district court is located.\u201d Fed. Rule of Civ.\nProc. 4(k)(1)(A). Here, Nevada has authorized its courts to\nexercise jurisdiction over persons \u201con any basis not inconsistent\nwith .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Nev.\nRev. Stat. \u00a714.065 (2011). Thus, in order to determine whetherthe\nFederal District Court in this case was authorized to exercise\njurisdiction over petitioner, we ask whether the exercise of\njurisdiction \u201ccomports with the limits imposed by federal due\nprocess\u201d on the State of Nevada. Daimler, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).B1The Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment constrains a State\u2019s authority\nto bind a nonresidentdefendant to a judgment of its courts.\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 291\n(1980) . Although a nonresident\u2019s physical presence within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the court is not required, the\nnonresident generally must have \u201ccertain minimum contacts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. such that the maintenance of the suit does not\noffend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.\u2019\u00a0\u201d International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326\nU.\u00a0S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311\nU.\u00a0S. 457, 463 (1940) ).This case addresses the\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary to create specific\njurisdiction.[6] The inquiry\nwhether a forum State may assert specific jurisdiction over a\nnonresident defendant \u201cfocuses on \u2018the relationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Keeton v. Hustler\nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.\u00a0S. 770, 775 (1984) (quoting Shaffer v.\nHeitner, 433 U.\u00a0S. 186, 204 (1977) ). For a State to exercise\njurisdiction consistent with due process, the defendant\u2019s\nsuit-related conduct must create a substantial connection with the\nforum State. Two related aspects of this necessary relationship are\nrelevant in this case.First, the relationship\nmust arise out of contacts that the \u201cdefendant himself\u201d creates\nwith the forum State. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\nU.\u00a0S. 462, 475 (1985) . Due process limits on the State\u2019s\nadjudicative authority principally protect the liberty of the\nnonresident defendant\u2014not the convenience of plaintiffs or third\nparties. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 291\u2013292. We\nhave consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the\ndefendant-focused \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry by demonstrating\ncontacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the forum\nState. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\u00a0A. v. Hall,\n466 U.\u00a0S. 408, 417 (1984) (\u201c[The] unilateral activity of\nanother party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration\nwhen determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a\nforum State to justify an assertion of jurisdiction\u201d). We have thus\nrejected a plaintiff\u2019s argument that a Florida court could exercise\nper-sonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on\nthe contacts of the trust\u2019s settlor, who was domiciled in Florida\nand had executed powers of appointment there. Hanson v. Denckla,\n357 U.\u00a0S. 235 \u2013254 (1958). We have likewise held that Oklahoma\ncourts could not exercise personal jurisdiction over an automobile\ndistributor that supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\ndealers based only on an automobile purchaser\u2019s act of driving it\non Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volks-wagen Corp., supra, at 298.\nPut simply, however sig-nificant the plaintiff\u2019s contacts with the\nforum may be, those contacts cannot be \u201cdecisive in determining\nwhether the defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated.\u201d Rush, 444\nU.\u00a0S., at 332.Second, our \u201cminimum\ncontacts\u201d analysis looks to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum\nState itself, not the defendant\u2019s contacts with persons who reside\nthere. See, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process\n\u201cdoes not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in\npersonam against an individual .\u00a0.\u00a0. with which the state\nhas no contacts, ties, or relations\u201d); Hanson, supra, at 251\n(\u201cHowever minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a\ndefendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the\n\u2018minimal contacts\u2019 with that State that are a prerequisite to its\nexercise of power over him\u201d). Accordingly, we have upheld the\nassertion of jurisdiction over defendants who have purposefully\n\u201creach[ed] out beyond\u201d their State and into another by, for\nexample, entering a contractual relationship that \u201cenvisioned\ncontinuing and wide-reaching contacts\u201d in the forum State, Burger\nKing, supra, at 479\u2013480, or by circulating magazines to\n\u201cdeliberately exploi[t]\u201d a market in the forum State, Keeton,\nsupra, at 781. And although physical presence in the forum is not a\nprerequisite to jurisdiction, Burger King, supra, at 476, physical\nentry into the State\u2014either by the defendant in person or through\nan agent, goods, mail, or some other means\u2014is certainly a relevant\ncontact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773\u2013774.But the plaintiff\ncannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum.\nRather, it is the defendant\u2019s conduct that must form the necessary\nconnection with the forum State that is the basis for its\njurisdiction over him. See Burger King, supra, at 478 (\u201cIf the\nquestion is whether an individual\u2019s contract with an out-of-state\nparty alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts\nin the other party\u2019s home forum, we believe the answer clearly is\nthat it cannot\u201d); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal., City and County\nof San Francisco, 436 U.\u00a0S. 84, 93 (1978) (declining to \u201cfind\npersonal jurisdiction in a State .\u00a0.\u00a0. merely because\n[the plaintiff in a child support action] was residing there\u201d). To\nbe sure, a defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State may be\nintertwined with his transactions or interactions with the\nplaintiff or other parties. But a defendant\u2019s relationship with a\nplaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis\nfor jurisdiction. See Rush, supra, at 332 (\u201cNaturally, the parties\u2019\nrelationships with each other may be significant in evaluating\ntheir ties to the forum. The requirements of International Shoe,\nhowever, must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court\nexercises jurisdiction\u201d). Due process requires that a defendant be\nhaled into court in a forum State based on his own affiliation with\nthe State, not based on the \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\u201d\ncontacts he makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with\nthe State. Burger King, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 475 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).2These same principles\napply when intentional torts are involved. In that context, it is\nlikewise insufficient to rely on a defendant\u2019s \u201crandom, fortuitous,\nor attenuated contacts\u201d or on the \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of a\nplaintiff. Ibid. (same). A forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction\nover an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on\nintentional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary\ncontacts with the forum.Calder v. Jones, 465\nU.\u00a0S. 783 , illustrates the application of these principles.\nIn Calder, a California actress brought a libel suit in California\nstate court against a reporter and an editor, both of whom worked\nfor the National Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The\nplaintiff\u2019s libel claims were based on an article written and\nedited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the National\nEnquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a California circulation\nof roughly 600,000.We held that\nCalifornia\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over the defendants was\nconsistent with due process. Although we recognized that the\ndefendants\u2019 activities \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on the plaintiff, our\njurisdictional inquiry \u201cfocuse[d] on \u2018the relationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 788\n(quoting Shaffer, 433 U.\u00a0S., at 204). Specifically, we\nexamined the various contacts the defendants had created with\nCalifornia (and not just with the plaintiff) by writing the\nallegedly libelous story.We found those forum\ncontacts to be ample: The defendants relied on phone calls to\n\u201cCalifornia sources\u201d for the information in their article; they\nwrote the story about the plaintiff\u2019s activities in California;\nthey caused reputa-tional injury in California by writing an\nallegedly libelous article that was widely circulated in the State;\nand the \u201cbrunt\u201d of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in\nthat State. 465 U.\u00a0S., at 788\u2013789. \u201cIn sum, California [wa]s\nthe focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.\u201d Id.,\nat 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was \u201ctherefore proper in\nCalifornia based on the \u2018effects\u2019 of their Florida conduct in\nCalifornia.\u201d Ibid.The crux of Calder was\nthat the reputation-based \u201ceffects\u201d of the alleged libel connected\nthe defendants to California, not just to the plaintiff. The\nstrength of that connection was largely a function of the nature of\nthe libel tort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it\ncan lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to (and read\nand understood by) third persons. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7577, Comment b (1976); see also ibid. (\u201c[R]eputation is the\nestimation in which one\u2019s character is held by his neighbors or\nassociates\u201d). Accordingly, the reputational injury caused by the\ndefendants\u2019 story would not have occurred but for the fact that the\ndefendants wrote an article for publication in California that was\nread by a large number of California citizens. Indeed, because\npublication to third persons is a necessary element of libel, see\nid., \u00a7558, the defendants\u2019 intentional tort actually occurred in\nCalifornia. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777 (\u201cThe tort of libel is\ngenerally held to occur wherever the offending material is\ncirculated\u201d). In this way, the \u201ceffects\u201d caused by the defendants\u2019\narticle\u2014i.e., the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the\nestimation of the California public\u2014connected the defendants\u2019\nconduct to California, not just to a plaintiff who lived there.\nThat connection, combined with the various facts that gave the\narticle a California focus, sufficed to authorize the California\ncourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction.[7]IIIApplying the\nforegoing principles, we conclude that petitioner lacks the\n\u201cminimal contacts\u201d with Nevada that are a prerequisite to the\nexercise of jurisdiction over him. Hanson, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 251.\nIt is undisputed that no part of petitioner\u2019s course of conduct\noccurred in Nevada. Petitioner approached, questioned, and searched\nrespondents, and seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport.\nIt is alleged that petitioner later helped draft a \u201cfalse probable\ncause affidavit\u201d in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to a\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia to support a potential\naction for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688 F.\u00a03d, at 563.\nPetitioner never traveled to, conducted activities within,\ncontacted anyone in, or sent anything or anyone to Nevada. In\nshort, when viewed through the proper lens\u2014whether the defendant\u2019s\nactions connect him to the forum\u2014petitioner formed no\njurisdictionally relevant contacts with Nevada.The Court of Appeals\nreached a contrary conclusion by shifting the analytical focus from\npetitioner\u2019s contacts with the forum to his contacts with\nrespondents. See Rush, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 332. Rather than\nassessing petitioner\u2019s own contacts with Nevada, the Court of\nAppeals looked to petitioner\u2019s knowledge of respondents\u2019 \u201cstrong\nforum connections.\u201d 688 F.\u00a03d, at 577\u2013579, 581. In the court\u2019s\nview, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that respondents\nsuffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satisfied the \u201cminimum\ncontacts\u201d inquiry.[8] Id., at\n582.This approach to the\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis impermissibly allows a plaintiff\u2019s\ncontacts with the defendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional\nanalysis. Petitioner\u2019s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient\ncontacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed his\nconduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections. Such\nreasoning improperly attributes a plain-tiff\u2019s forum connections to\nthe defendant and makes those connections \u201cdecisive\u201d in the\njurisdictional analysis. See Rush, supra, at 332. It also obscures\nthe reality that none of petitioner\u2019s challenged conduct had\nanything to do with Nevada itself.Relying on Calder,\nrespondents emphasize that they suffered the \u201cinjury\u201d caused by\npetitioner\u2019s allegedly tortious conduct (i.e., the delayed return\nof their gambling funds) while they were residing in the forum.\nBrief for Respondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As\npreviously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a forum\nresident is not a sufficient connection to the forum. Regardless of\nwhere a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is jurisdictionally\nrelevant only insofar as it shows that the defendant has formed a\ncontact with the forum State. The proper question is not where the\nplaintiff experienced a particular injury or effect but whether the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful\nway.Respondents\u2019 claimed\ninjury does not evince a connection between petitioner and Nevada.\nEven if we consider the continuation of the seizure in Georgia to\nbe a distinct injury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered\nto Nevada in any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respondents)\nlacked access to their funds in Nevada not because anything\nindependently occurred there, but because Nevada is where\nrespondents chose to be at a time when they desired to use the\nfunds seized by petitioner. Respondents would have experienced this\nsame lack of access in California, Mississippi, or wherever else\nthey might have traveled and found themselves wanting more money\nthan they had. Unlike the broad publication of the forum-focused\nstory in Calder, the effects of petitioner\u2019s con-duct on\nrespondents are not connected to the forum State in a way that\nmakes those effects a proper basis forjurisdiction.[9]The Court of Appeals\npointed to other possible contacts with Nevada, each ultimately\nunavailing. Respondents\u2019 Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in\nGeorgia, but that is precisely the sort of \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of\na third party that \u201ccannot satisfy the requirement of contact with\nthe forum State.\u201d Hanson, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 253. Respondents\nallege that some of the cash seized in Georgia \u201coriginated\u201d in\nNevada, but that attenuated connection was not created by\npetitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada, when\npetitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventually returned\nto respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had nothing to do with\nthat return (indeed, it seems likely that it was respondents\u2019\nunilateral decision to have their funds sent to Nevada).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Well-established\nprinciples of personal jurisdiction are sufficient to decide this\ncase. The proper focus of the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry in\nintentional-tort cases is \u201c\u00a0\u2018the relationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Calder, 465\nU.\u00a0S., at 788. And it is the defendant, not the plaintiff or\nthird parties, who must create contacts with the forum State. In\nthis case, the application of those principles is clear:\nPetitioner\u2019s relevant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the\nmere fact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connectionsto\nthe forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdiction. We\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.Notes1Respondents allege that\nthe sniff test was \u201cat best, inconclusive,\u201d and there is no\nindication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue were ever\nfound on or with the cash. App. 21.2The alleged affidavit is\nnot in the record. Because this case comes to us at the\nmotion-to-dismiss stage, we take respondents\u2019 factual allegations\nas true, including their allegations regarding the existence and\ncontent of the affidavit.3The allegations in the\ncomplaint suggested to the Court of Appeals that petitioner\n\u201cdefinitely knew, at some point the seizure but providing the\nalleged false probable cause affidavit, that [respondents] had a\nsignificant connection to Nevada.\u201d 688 F.\u00a03d, at\n578.4Judge Ikuta dissented. In\nher view, the \u201cfalse affidavit/forfeiture proceeding aspect\u201d over\nwhich the majority found jurisdiction proper was not raised as a\nseparate claim in the complaint, and she found it \u201cdoubtful that\nsuch a constitutional tort even exists.\u201d ., at 593. After the court\ndenied rehearing en banc, the majority explained in a postscript\nthat it viewed the filing of the false affidavit, which effected a\n\u201ccontinued seizure\u201d of the funds, as a separate violation. at\n588\u2013589. Petitioner does not dispute that reading\nhere.5We also granted\ncertiorari on the question whether Nevada is a proper venue for the\nsuit under . Because we resolve the case on jurisdictional grounds,\nwe do not decide whether venue was proper in Nevada.6\u201cSpecific\u201d or\n\u201ccase-linked\u201d jurisdiction \u201cdepends on an \u2018affiliatio[n] between\nthe forum and the underlying controversy\u2019\u00a0\u201d (, an \u201cactivity or\nan occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore\nsubject to the State\u2019s regulation\u201d). v. , 564 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 2). This is in contrast to \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201call\npurpose\u201d jurisdiction, which permits a court to assert jurisdiction\nover a defendant based on a forum connection unrelated to the\nunderlying suit (domicile). Respondents rely on specific\njurisdiction only.7The defendants in argued\nthat no contacts they had with California were sufficiently\npurposeful because their employer was responsible for circulation\nof the article. See v. , . We rejected that argument. Even though\nthe defendants did not circulate the article themselves, they\n\u201cexpressly aimed\u201d \u201ctheir intentional, and allegedly tortious,\nactions\u201d at California be-cause they knew the National Enquirer\n\u201cha[d] its largest circulation\u201d in California, and that the article\nwould \u201chave a potentially devastating impact\u201d there. , at\n789\u20137908Respondents propose a\nsubstantially similar analysis. They suggest that \u201ca defendant\ncreates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum when he (1)\nintentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3) for\nimposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while\nshe is residing in the forum state.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n26\u201327.9Respondents warn that if\nwe decide petitioner lacks minimum contacts in this case, it will\nbring about unfairness in cases where intentional torts are\ncommitted via the Internet or other electronic means ( fraudulent\naccess of financial accounts or \u201cphishing\u201d schemes). As an initial\nmatter, we reiterate that the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry\nprincipally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not\nthe interests of the plaintiff. v.,444 U.\u00a0S., 286, 291\u2013292\n(1980). In any event, this case does not present the very different\nquestions whether and how a defendant\u2019s virtual \u201cpresence\u201d and\nconduct translate into \u201ccontacts\u201d with a particular State. To the\ncontrary, there is no question where the conduct giving rise to\nthis litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from\nrespondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and\nforwarded an affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual\ncontacts for another day.",
