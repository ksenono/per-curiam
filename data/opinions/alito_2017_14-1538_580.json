How much further is the question in this case, and the\ngenesis of \u00a7271(f) sheds no light on that question.I note, in addition, that while the Court holds\nthat a single component cannot constitute a substantial portion of\nan invention\u2019s components for \u00a7271(f)(1) purposes, I do not read\nthe opinion to suggest thatanynumber greater than one is\nsufficient. In other words, today\u2019s opinion establishes that more\nthan one component is necessary, but does not addresshow\nmuchmore.",
