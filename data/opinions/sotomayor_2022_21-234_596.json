GEORGE, PETITIONERv.DENIS R.\nMcDONOUGH, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRSon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[June 15, 2022]Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.I join all but Part II\u2013C of Justice Gorsuch\u2019s\ndissent. The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board) clearly and\nunmistakably violated a statutory command in its decision denying\npetitioner Kevin George\u2019s application for service-related benefits.\nAs Justice Gorsuch explains, in the context of this specific\nstatutory framework, the mere fact that the Board relied on a\nplainly invalid regulation does not shield its final decision from\nreview based on clear and unmistakable error.[1]The Court thinks otherwise. In support of its\nholding, the Court notes that Congress, when it enacted the\nclear-and-unmistakable-error statutes in 1997, codified a\npre-existing regulatory doctrine under which clear and unmistakable\nerror did not encompass a subsequent \u201cchange in interpretation of\nlaw.\u201d 38 CFR \u00a73.105 (Cum. Supp. 1963); seeante,at 5\u20136. I\nagree that Congress incorporated this pre-existing regulatory\ndoctrine based on its use of \u201cclear and unmistakable error,\u201d a\nlongstanding term of art. Seeante,at 5, 12.[2] I diverge from Justice Gorsuch on this\npoint. The question remains, however: What constitutes a \u201cchange in\ninterpretation of law\u201d excluded from clear and unmistakable error?\nIn George\u2019s view, a change in interpretation of law occurs where\n\u201can agency .\u00a0.\u00a0. choos[es] another permissible\nalternative construction\u201d of a statute, but not where, as here, a\ncourt invalidates a regulation that had egregiously violated the\ngoverning statute all along. Brief for Petitioner 18; see alsopost,at 4\u20135 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).The Court disagrees. It holds that under the\npre-existing doctrine, judicial invalidation of an unmistakably\nerroneous regulation was understood to constitute a \u201cchange in\ninterpretation of law\u201d for purposes of clear and unmistakable\nerror. Seeante,at 5\u20139. The Court\u2019s citations offer little\nsupport for this conclusion, however. InBergerv.Brown, 10 Vet. App. 166, 170 (1997), for example, the Court\nof Veterans Appeals (Veterans Court) stated that opinions from that\nbody \u201cthat formulate new interpretations of the law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncannot be the basis of a valid [clear-and-unmistakable-error]\nclaim.\u201d But the Veterans Court emphasized that the decision under\nattack, unlike the Board\u2019s decision in George\u2019s case, had followed\n\u201ca plausible interpretation of the law,\u201d precluded by \u201cnothing in\nthe plain language of the statute,\u201d and added that \u201c[t]he statute\nwas, and still is for that matter, susceptible of differing\ninterpretations.\u201dIbid.Similarly, inDamrelv.Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 246 (1994), the relevant change in\ninterpretation of law was a Veterans Court-created rule, not the\ninvalidation of a regulation as clearly contrary to the governing\nstatute. And although it was well established by 1997 that clear\nand unmistakable error \u201cmust be based on .\u00a0.\u00a0. the law\nthat existed at the time of the prior .\u00a0.\u00a0. decision,\u201dRussellv.Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 314 (1992) (en\nbanc), this is not inconsistent with George\u2019s request for review\nbased on the plain terms of a statute as it existed in 1977, when\nthe Board ruled against him.Other authorities relied upon by the Court are\nequivocal. The VA opined in 1994 that invalidation of a regulation\nby the Veterans Court constituted a \u201c\u00a0\u2018change in\ninterpretation of law,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but it also admitted \u201cthat VA\u2019s\nhistorical approach has not been entirely consistent.\u201d Op. Gen.\nCounsel Precedent 9\u201394, \u00b6\u00b66, 8, pp.\u00a04\u20135 (Mar. 25). Meanwhile,\nthe Veterans Court\u2019s 1992 decision inLookv.Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 157, while not a model of clarity,\nundeniably \u201capprov[ed of] collateral relief\u00a0\u201d based on \u201ca\nlater invalidated regulation,\u201d as the Court recognizes.Ante,at 8.My takeaway from these conflicting authorities\nis that the pre-existing doctrine Congress incorporated in 1997 was\nunsettled as to whether judicial invalidation of a regulation that\nsquarely contravened an unambiguous statute constituted a \u201cchange\nin interpretation of law.\u201d In other words, where the Court\nperceives certainty, I see at most confusion. Confronted with an\nambiguity in the scheme Congress codified into statute, I would\napply the venerable \u201c\u00a0\u2018canon that provisions for benefits to\nmembers of the Armed Services are to be construed in the\nbeneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHendersonv.Shinseki,562 U.S.\n428, 441 (2011) (quotingKingv.St. Vincent\u2019s\nHospital,502 U.S.\n215, 220\u2013221, n.\u00a09 (1991)). Accordingly, I would hold that\nGeorge may seek review based on clear and unmistakable error.For these reasons, as well as others set forth\nby Justice Gorsuch, I respectfully dissent.Notes1In my view, some invalid\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations might not be\nerroneous enough for reliance on them to constitute clear and\nunmistakable error. After all, by definition, not every error is\nclear and unmistakable. The Board\u2019s 1977 decision in George\u2019s case,\nhowever, meets this demanding standard. The\npresumption-of-soundness regulation the Board applied was clearly\nand unmistakably contrary to the unambiguous terms of 38\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71111, as even the VA eventually conceded. Seepost,at 2\u20133 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).2Were there any doubt,\nlegislative history would render the conclusion unavoidable. See\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 105\u201352, pp.\u00a01\u20132 (1997) (\u201cH.\u00a0R. 1090\nwould .\u00a0.\u00a0. codify existing regulations which make [VA]\ndecisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. subject to revision on the grounds of\nclear and unmistakable error\u201d); S.\u00a0Rep. No. 105\u201357, p.\u00a04\n(1997) (\u201cThe Committee bill .\u00a0.\u00a0. would codify, in\nstatute, the allowance currently specified by regulation\u201d for\nreview based on clear and unmistakable error).",
