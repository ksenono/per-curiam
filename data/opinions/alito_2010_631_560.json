S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-5327ALBERT HOLLAND, PETITIONERv.FLORIDAon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[June 14, 2010]Justice Alito, concurring in part\nand concurring in the judgment.This case raises two broad\nquestions: first, whether the statute of limitations set out in the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and\nsecond, assuming an affirmative answer to the first question,\nwhether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts that\nare sufficient to satisfy the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d prong\nof the equitable tolling test. I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat equitable tolling is available under AEDPA. I also agree with\nmuch of the Court\u2019s discussion concerning whether equitable tolling\nis available on the facts of this particular case. In particular, I\nagree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limiting the\nrelevant inquiry to the question whether \u201cgross negligence\u201d of\ncounsel may be an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable\ntolling. As the Court makes clear, petitioner in this case has\nalleged certain facts that go well beyond any form of attorney\nnegligence, seeante, at 3\u20134, 19, and the Court of Appeals\ndoes not appear to have asked whether those particular facts\nprovide an independent basis for tolling. Accordingly, I concur in\nthe Court\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment below and remand so\nthat the lower courts may properly apply the correct legal\nstandard.Although I agree that the Court of Appeals\napplied thewrongstandard, I think that the majority does\nnot do enough to explain therightstandard. It is of\ncourse true that equitable tolling requires \u201cextraordinary\ncircumstances,\u201d but that conclusory formulation does not provide\nmuch guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the many\nhabeas petitions filed every year. I therefore write separately to\nset forth my understanding of the principles governing the\navailability of equitable tolling in cases involving attorney\nmisconduct.I\u201cGenerally, a litigant seeking\nequitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements:\n(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that\nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\u201dPacev.DiGuglielmo,544 U. S. 408, 418\n(2005). The dispute in this case concerns whether and when attorney\nmisconduct amounts to an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that stands\nin a petitioner\u2019s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a\ntimely petition. I agree with the majority that it is not practical\nto attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation of the kinds of\nsituations in which attorney misconduct may provide a basis for\nequitable tolling. In my view, however, it is useful to note that\nseveral broad principles may be distilled from this Court\u2019s\nprecedents.First, our prior cases make it\nabundantly clear that attorney negligence is not an extraordinary\ncircumstance warranting equitable tolling. InLawrencev.Florida,549 U. S. 327, 336\n(2007), the Court expressly rejected the petitioner\u2019s contention\nthat \u201chis counsel\u2019s mistake in miscalculating the limitations\nperiod entitle[d] him to equitable tolling.\u201d \u201cAttorney\nmiscalculation,\u201d the Court held, \u201cis simply not sufficient to\nwarrant equitable tolling,particularly in the postconviction\ncontext where prisoners have no constitutional right to\ncounsel.\u201dId.,at 336\u2013337 (citingColemanv.Thompson,501 U. S. 722, 756\u2013757\n(1991) (emphasis added)).The basic rationale forLawrence\u2019s\nholding is that the mistakes of counsel are constructively\nattributable to the client, at least in the postconviction context.\nTheLawrenceCourt\u2019s reliance onColemanis\ninstructive. InColeman, the Court addressed whether\nattorney error provided cause for a procedural default based on a\nlate filing. See 501 U. S., at 752. Because \u201c[t]here is no\nconstitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction\nproceedings,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca petitioner cannot claim\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such\nproceedings.\u201dIbid.In such circumstances, the Court\nreasoned, there was \u201c\u00a0\u2018no inequity in requiring [the\npetitioner] to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a\nprocedural default.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingMurrayv.Carrier,477 U. S. 478, 488\n(1986)); accord,Coleman,501 U. S., at 753\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018[C]ause\u2019 under the cause and prejudice test must be\nsomethingexternalto the petitioner, something that\ncannot fairly be attributed to him\u201d);ibid.(\u201cAttorney\nignorance or inadvertence is not \u2018cause\u2019 because the attorney is\nthe petitioner\u2019s agent when acting, or failing to act, in\nfurtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must \u2018bear the\nrisk of attorney error\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at 754 (what matters\nis whether \u201cthe error [of counsel] must be seen as an external\nfactor,i.e., \u2018imputed to the State\u2019\u00a0\u201d);ibid.(\u201cIn the absence of a constitutional violation, the\npetitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors\nmade in the course of the representation\u201d);id., at 757\n(\u201cBecause Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in\nstate habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of\nColeman\u2019s claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse\nthe default in federal habeas\u201d). AsLawrencemakes clear,\nthe same analysis applies when a petitioner seeks equitable tolling\nbased on attorney error in the postconviction context. See 549 U.\nS., at 336\u2013337 (citingColeman).WhileLawrenceaddressed an\nallegation of attorney miscalculation, its rationale fully applies\nto other forms of attorney negligence. Instead of miscalculating\nthe filing deadline, for example, an attorney could compute the\ndeadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on time,\nmail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do the requisite\nresearch to determine the applicable deadline. In any case,\nhowever, counsel\u2019s error would be constructively attributable to\nthe client.Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline\ninvolves \u201cgross negligence\u201d on the part of counsel does not by\nitself establish an extraordinary circumstance. As explained above,\nthe principal rationale for disallowing equitable tolling based on\nordinary attorney miscalculation is that the error of an attorney\nis constructively attributable to the client and thus is not a\ncircumstance beyond the litigant\u2019s control. SeeLawrence,supra,at 336\u2013337;Coleman,supra,at\n752\u2013754; see alsoPowellv.Davis, 415 F.\u00a03d\n722, 727 (CA7 2005);Johnsonv.McBride, 381\nF.\u00a03d 587, 589\u2013590 (CA7 2004);Harrisv.Hutchinson, 209 F.\u00a03d 325, 330 (CA4 2000). That\nrationale plainly applies regardless whether the attorney error in\nquestion involves ordinary or gross negligence. SeeColeman, 501 U. S., at 754 (\u201c[I]t is not the gravity of\nthe attorney\u2019s error that matters, but that it constitutes a\nviolation of petitioner\u2019s right to counsel, so that the error must\nbe seen as an external factor,i.e.,\u2018imputed to the\nState\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at 752 (rejecting the contention that\n\u201c[t]he late filing was \u2026 the result of attorney error of sufficient\nmagnitude to excuse the default in federal habeas\u201d).Allowing equitable tolling in cases involvinggrossrather thanordinaryattorney negligence\nwould not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it\nwould also be impractical in the extreme. Missing the statute of\nlimitations will generally, if not always, amount to negligence,\nseeLawrence,549 U. S., at 336, and it has been aptly\nsaid that gross negligence is ordinary negligence with a\nvituperative epithet added. Therefore, if gross negligence may be\nenough for equitable tolling, there will be a basis for arguing\nthat tolling is appropriate in almost every counseled case\ninvolving a missed deadline. Seeibid.(argument that\nattorney miscalculation is an extraordinary circumstance, if\ncredited, \u201cwould essentially equitably toll limitations periods for\nevery person whose attorney missed a deadline\u201d). This would not\njust impose a severe burden on the district courts; it would also\nmake the availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial\ndistinction between gross and ordinary negligence. That line would\nbe hard to administer, would needlessly consume scarce judicial\nresources, and would almost certainly yield inconsistent and often\nunsatisfying results. SeeBaldayaquev.United\nStates, 338 F.\u00a03d 145, 155 (CA2 2003) (Jacobs, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that the \u201cdistinction between ordinary and\nextraordinary attorney malpractice \u2026 is elusive, hard to apply, and\ncounterintuitive\u201d).Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that\ndistinguishes between ordinary and gross attorney negligence for\npurposes of the equitable tolling analysis would have demonstrably\n\u201cinequitable\u201d consequences. For example, it is hard to see why a\nhabeas petitioner should be effectively penalized just because his\ncounsel was negligent rather than grossly negligent, or why the\nState should be penalized just because petitioner\u2019s counsel was\ngrossly negligent rather than moderately negligent. Regardless of\nhow one characterizes counsel\u2019s deficient performance in such\ncases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the untimely\nfiling, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late filing, and\nthe governmental interest in enforcing the statutory limitations\nperiod is the same.IIAlthough attorney negligence,\nhowever styled, does not provide a basis for equitable tolling, the\nAEDPA statute of limitations may be tolled if the missed deadline\nresults from attorney misconduct that is not constructively\nattributable to the petitioner. In this case, petitioner alleges\nfacts that amount to such misconduct. Seeante, at 19\n(acknowledging that ordinary attorney negligence does not warrant\nequitable tolling, but observing that \u201cthe facts of this case\npresent far more serious instances of attorney misconduct\u201d). In\nparticular, he alleges that his attorney essentially \u201cabandoned\u201d\nhim, as evidenced by counsel\u2019s near-total failure to communicate\nwith petitioner or to respond to petitioner\u2019s many inquiries and\nrequests over a period of several years. Seeante, at 3\u20134.\nPetitioner also appears to allege that he made reasonable efforts\nto terminate counsel due to his inadequate representation and to\nproceedpro se, and that such efforts were successfully\nopposed by the State on the perverse ground that petitioner failed\nto act through appointed counsel. Seeante, at 4; Brief\nfor Petitioner 50\u201351 (stating that petitioner filed \u201ctwopro\nsemotions in the Florida Supreme Court to remove Collins as\ncounsel (one which, if granted, would have allowed [petitioner] to\nproceedpro se)\u201d (emphasis deleted)).If true, petitioner\u2019s allegations\nwould suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his\ncontrol. Common sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held\nconstructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is\nnot operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\nSeeColeman,supra,at 754 (relying on\n\u201cwell-settled principles of agency law\u201d to determine whether\nattorney error was attributable to client);Baldayaque,supra,at 154 (Jacobs, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]hen an \u2018agent\nacts in a manner completely adverse to the principal\u2019s interest,\u2019\nthe \u2018principal is not charged with [the] agent\u2019s misdeeds\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nThat is particularly so if the litigant\u2019s reasonable efforts to\nterminate the attorney\u2019s representation have been thwarted by\nforces wholly beyond the petitioner\u2019s control. The Court of Appeals\napparently did not consider petitioner\u2019s abandonment argument or\nassess whether the State improperly prevented petitioner from\neither obtaining new representation or assuming the responsibility\nof representing himself. Accordingly, I agree with the majority\nthat the appropriate disposition is to reverse and remand so that\nthe lower courts may apply the correct standard to the facts\nalleged here.",
