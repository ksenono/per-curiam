Compare\nMcConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409 (1990), with\nHamburger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption: An\nHistorical Perspective, 60 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 915 (1992). But we\nknow this with certainty: when the government fails to act\nneutrally toward the free exercise of religion, it tends to run\ninto trouble. Then the government can prevail only if it satisfies\nstrict scrutiny, showing that its restrictions on religion both\nserve a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored.Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.v.Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520,\n546 (1993).Today\u2019s decision respects these principles. As\nthe Court explains, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission failed to\nact neutrally toward Jack Phillips\u2019s religious faith. Maybe most\nnotably, the Commission allowed three other bakers to refuse a\ncustomer\u2019s request that would have required them to violate their\nsecular commitments. Yet it denied the same accommodation to Mr.\nPhillips when he refused a customer\u2019s request that would have\nrequired him to violate his religious beliefs.Ante,at\n14\u201316. As the Court also explains, the only reason the Commission\nseemed to supply for its discrimination was that it found Mr.\nPhillips\u2019s religious beliefs \u201coffensive.\u201dIbid.That kind of\njudgmental dismissal of a sincerely held religious belief is, of\ncourse, antithetical to the First Amendment and cannot begin to\nsatisfy strict scrutiny. The Constitution protects not just popular\nreligious exercises from the condemnation of civil authorities. It\nprotects them all. Because the Court documents each of these points\ncarefully and thoroughly, I am pleased to join its opinion in\nfull.The only wrinkle is this. In the face of so much\nevidence suggesting hostility toward Mr. Phillips\u2019s sincerely held\nreligious beliefs, two of our colleagues have written separately to\nsuggest that the Commission acted neutrally toward his faith when\nit treated him differently from the other bakers\u2014or that it could\nhave easily done so consistent with the First Amendment. Seepost,at 4\u20135, and n.\u00a04 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting);ante,at 2\u20133, and n. (Kagan, J., concurring). But,\nrespectfully, I do not see how we might rescue the Commission from\nits error.A full view of the facts helps point the way to\nthe problem. Start with William Jack\u2019s case. He approached three\nbakers and asked them to prepare cakes with messages disapproving\nsame-sex marriage on religious grounds. App. 233, 243, 252. All\nthree bakers refused Mr. Jack\u2019s request, stating that they found\nhis request offensive to their secular convictions.Id., at\n231, 241, 250. Mr. Jack responded by filing complaints with the\nColorado Civil Rights Division.Id., at 230, 240, 249. He\npointed to Colorado\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits\ndiscrimination against customers in public accommodations because\nof religious creed, sexual orientation, or certain other traits.\nSeeibid.; Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a724\u201334\u2013601(2)(a) (2017). Mr.\nJack argued that the cakes he sought reflected his religious\nbeliefs and that the bakers could not refuse to make them just\nbecause they happened to disagree with his beliefs. App. 231, 241,\n250. But the Division declined to find a violation, reasoning that\nthe bakers didn\u2019t deny Mr. Jack service because of his religious\nfaith but because the cakes he sought were offensive to their own\nmoral convictions.Id., at 237, 247, 255\u2013256. As proof, the\nDivision pointed to the fact that the bakers said they treated Mr.\nJack as they would have anyone who requested a cake with similar\nmessages, regardless of their religion.Id., at 230\u2013231,\n240, 249.The Division pointed, as well, to the fact that\nthe bakers said they were happy to provide religious persons with\nother cakes expressing other ideas.Id., at 237, 247, 257.\nMr. Jack appealed to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, but the\nCommission summarily denied relief. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n326a\u2013331a.Next, take the undisputed facts of Mr.\nPhillips\u2019s case. Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins approached Mr.\nPhillips about creating a cake to celebrate their wedding. App.\n168. Mr. Phillips explained that he could not prepare a cake\ncelebrating a same-sex wedding consistent with his religious faith.Id.,at 168\u2013169.But Mr. Phillips offered to make\nother baked goods for the couple, including cakes celebrating other\noccasions.Ibid.Later, Mr. Phillips testified without\ncontradiction that he would have refused to create a cake\ncelebrating a same-sex marriage for any customer, regardless of his\nor her sexual orientation.Id.,at 166\u2013167 (\u201cI will not\ndesign and create wedding cakes for a same-sex wedding regardless\nof the sexual orientation of the customer\u201d). And the record reveals\nthat Mr. Phillips apparently refused just such a request from Mr.\nCraig\u2019s mother.Id.,at 38\u201340, 169. (Any suggestion that Mr.\nPhillips was willing to make a cake celebrating a same-sex marriage\nfor a heterosexual customer or was not willing to sell other\nproducts to a homosexual customer, then, would simply mistake the\nundisputed factual record. Seepost,at 4, n.\u00a02\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting);ante,at 2\u20133, and n. (Kagan, J.,\nconcurring)). Nonetheless, the Commission held that Mr. Phillips\u2019s\nconduct violated the Colorado public accommodations law. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 56a\u201358a.The facts show that the two cases share all\nlegally sa- lient features. In both cases, the effect on the\ncustomer was the same: bakers refused service to persons who bore a\nstatutorily protected trait (religious faith or sexual\norientation). But in both cases the bakers refused service\nintending only to honor a personal conviction. To be sure, the\nbakersknewtheir conduct promised the effect of leaving a\ncustomer in a protected class unserved. But there\u2019s no indication\nthe bakers actuallyintendedto refuse servicebecause\nofa customer\u2019s protected characteristic. We know this because\nall of the bakers explained without contradiction that they would\nnot sell the requested cakes to anyone, while they would sell other\ncakes to members of the protected class (as well as to anyone\nelse). So, for example, the bakers in the first case would have\nrefused to sell a cake denigrating same-sex marriage to an atheist\ncustomer, just as the baker in the second case would have refused\nto sell a cake celebrating same-sex marriage to a heterosexual\ncustomer. And the bakers in the first case were generally happy to\nsell to persons of faith, just as the baker in the second case was\ngenerally happy to sell to gay persons. In both cases, it was the\nkind of cake, not the kind of customer, that mattered to the\nbakers.The distinction between intended and knowingly\naccepted effects is familiar in life and law. Often the purposeful\npursuit of worthy commitments requires us to accept unwanted but\nentirely foreseeable side effects: so, for example, choosing to\nspend time with family means the foreseeable loss of time for\ncharitable work, just as opting for more time in the office means\nknowingly forgoing time at home with loved ones. The law, too,\nsometimes distinguishes between intended and foreseeable effects.\nSee,e.g.,ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7\u00a71.13, 2.02(2)(a)(i)\n(1985); 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a75.2(b), pp. 460\u2013463\n(3d ed. 2018). Other times, of course, the law proceeds\ndifferently, either conflating intent and knowledge or presuming\nintent as a matter of law from a showing of knowledge. See,e.g.,Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a78A (1965);Radio\nOfficersv.NLRB, 347 U.\u00a0S. 17, 45 (1954).The problem here is that the Commission failed\nto act neutrally by applying a consistent legal rule. In Mr. Jack\u2019s\ncase, the Commission chose to distinguish carefully between\nintended and knowingly accepted effects. Even though the bakers\nknowingly denied service to someone in a protected class, the\nCommission found no violation because the bakers only intended to\ndistance themselves from \u201cthe offensive nature of the requested\nmessage.\u201dCraigv.Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc., 370\nP.\u00a03d 272, 282, n.\u00a08 (Colo. App. 2015); App. 237, 247,\n256; App. to Pet. for Cert. 326a\u2013331a; see also Brief for\nRespondent Colorado Civil Rights Commission 52 (\u201cBusinesses are\nentitled to reject orders for any number of reasons, including\nbecause they deem a particular product requested by a customer to\nbe \u2018offensive\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Yet, in Mr. Phillips\u2019s case, the Commission\ndismissed this very same argument as resting on a \u201cdistinction\nwithout a difference.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. It concluded\ninstead that an \u201cintent to disfavor\u201d a protected class of persons\nshould be \u201creadily .\u00a0.\u00a0. presumed\u201d from the knowing\nfailure to serve someone who belongs to that class.Id.,at\n70a. In its judgment, Mr. Phillips\u2019s intentions were \u201cinextricably\ntied to the sexual orientation of the parties involved\u201d and\nessentially \u201cirrational.\u201dIbid.Nothing in the Commission\u2019s opinions suggests\nany neutral principle to reconcile these holdings. If Mr.\nPhillips\u2019s objection is \u201cinextricably tied\u201d to a protected class,\nthen the bakers\u2019 objection in Mr. Jack\u2019s case must be \u201cinextricably\ntied\u201d to one as well. For just as cakes celebrating same-sex\nweddings are (usually) requested by persons of a particular sexual\norientation, so too are cakes expressing religious opposition to\nsame-sex weddings (usually) requested by persons of particular\nreligious faiths. In both cases the bakers\u2019 objection would\n(usually) result in turning down customers who bear a protected\ncharacteristic. In the end, the Commission\u2019s decisions simply\nreduce to this: itpresumedthat Mr. Phillip harbored an\nintent to discriminate against a protected class in light of the\nforeseeable effects of his conduct, but it declined to presume the\nsame intent in Mr. Jack\u2019s case even though the effects of the\nbakers\u2019 conduct were just as foreseeable. Underscoring the double\nstandard, a state appellate court said that \u201cno such showing\u201d of\nactual \u201canimus\u201d\u2014or intent to discriminate against persons in a\nprotected class\u2014was even required in Mr. Phillips\u2019s case. 370\nP.\u00a03d, at 282.The Commission cannot have it both ways. The\nCommission cannot slide up and down themens reascale,\npicking a mental state standard to suit its tastes depending on its\nsympathies. Either actual proof of intent to discriminate on the\nbasis of membership in a protected class is required (as the\nCommission held in Mr. Jack\u2019s case), or it is sufficient to\n\u201cpresume\u201d such intent from the knowing failure to serve someone in\na protected class (as the Commission held in Mr. Phillips\u2019s case).\nPerhaps the Commission could have chosen either course as an\ninitial matter. But the one thing it can\u2019t do is apply a more\ngenerous legal test to secular objections than religious ones. SeeChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye,508 U.\u00a0S., at 543\u2013544.\nThat is anything but the neutral treatment of religion.The real explanation for the Commission\u2019s\ndiscrimination soon comes clear, too\u2014and it does anything but help\nits cause. This isn\u2019t a case where the Commission self-consciously\nannounced a change in its legal rule in all public accommodation\ncases. Nor is this a case where the Commission offered some\npersuasive reason for its discrimination that might survive strict\nscrutiny. Instead, as the Court explains, it appears the Commission\nwished to condemn Mr. Phillips for expressing just the kind of\n\u201cirrational\u201d or \u201coffensive .\u00a0.\u00a0. message\u201d that the bakers\nin the first case refused to endorse.Ante,at 16. Many may\nagree with the Commission and consider Mr. Phillips\u2019s religious\nbeliefs irrational or offensive. Some may believe he misinterprets\nthe teachings of his faith. And, to be sure, this Court has held\nsame-sex marriage a matter of constitutional right and various\nStates have enacted laws that preclude discrimination on the basis\nof sexual orientation. But it is also true that no bureaucratic\njudgment condemning a sincerely held religious belief as\n\u201cirrational\u201d or \u201coffensive\u201d will ever survive strict scrutiny under\nthe First Amendment. In this country, the place of secular\nofficials isn\u2019t to sit in judgment of religious beliefs, but only\nto protect their free exercise. Just as it is the \u201cproudest boast\nof our free speech jurisprudence\u201d that we protect speech that we\nhate, it must be the proudest boast of our free exercise\njurisprudence that we protect religious beliefs that we find\noffensive. SeeMatalv.Tam, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 25) (citingUnited\nStatesv.Schwimmer, 279 U.\u00a0S. 644, 655 (1929)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting)). Popular religious views are easy enough\nto defend. It is in protecting unpopular religious beliefs that we\nprove this country\u2019s commitment to serving as a refuge for\nreligious freedom. SeeChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, supra,\nat 547;Thomasv.Review Bd. of Indiana Employment\nSecurity Div., 450 U.\u00a0S. 707, 715\u2013716 (1981);Wisconsinv.Yoder, 406 U.\u00a0S. 205, 223\u2013224\n(1972);Cantwellv.Connecticut, 310 U.\u00a0S. 296,\n308\u2013310 (1940).Nor can any amount of after-the-fact maneuvering\nby our colleagues save the Commission. It is no answer, for\nexample, to observe that Mr. Jack requested a cake with text on it\nwhile Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins sought a cake celebrating their\nwedding without discussing its decoration, and then suggest this\ndistinction makes all the difference. Seepost,at 4\u20135, and\nn.\u00a04 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). It is no answer either simply\nto slide up a level of generality to redescribe Mr. Phillips\u2019s case\nas involving only a wedding cake like any other, so the fact that\nMr. Phillips would make one for some means he must make them for\nall. Seeante,at 2\u20133, and n. (Kagan, J., concurring). These\narguments, too, fail to afford Mr. Phillips\u2019s faith neutral\nrespect.Take the first suggestion first. To suggest that\ncakes with words convey a message but cakes without words do\nnot\u2014all in order to excuse the bakers in Mr. Jack\u2019s case while\npenalizing Mr. Phillips\u2014is irrational. Not even the Commission or\ncourt of appeals purported to rely on that distinction. Imagine Mr.\nJack asked only for a cake with a symbolic expression against\nsame-sex marriage rather than a cake bearing words conveying the\nsame idea. Surely the Commission would have approved the bakers\u2019\nintentional wish to avoid participating in that message too. Nor\ncan anyone reasonably doubt that a wedding cake without words\nconveys a message. Words or not and whatever the exact design, it\ncelebrates a wedding, and if the wedding cake is made for a\nsame-sex couple it celebrates a same-sex wedding. See 370\nP.\u00a03d, at 276 (stating that Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins\n\u201crequested that Phillips design and create acaketo\ncelebrate their same-sex wedding\u201d) (emphasis added). Like \u201can\nemblem or flag,\u201d a cake for a same-sex wedding is a symbol that\nserves as \u201ca short cut from mind to mind,\u201d signifying approval of a\nspecific \u201csystem, idea, [or] institution.\u201dWest Virginia Bd. of\nEd.v.Barnette, 319 U.\u00a0S. 624, 632 (1943). It is\nprecisely that approval that Mr. Phillips intended to withhold in\nkeeping with his religious faith. The Commission denied Mr.\nPhillips that choice, even as it afforded the bakers in Mr. Jack\u2019s\ncase the choice to refuse to advance a message they deemed\noffensive to their secular commitments. That is not neutral.Nor would it be proper for this or any court to\nsuggest that a person must be forced to write words rather than\ncreate a symbol before his religious faith is implicated. Civil\nauthorities, whether \u201chigh or petty,\u201d bear no license to declare\nwhat is or should be \u201corthodox\u201d when it comes to religious beliefs,id.,at 642, or whether an adherent has \u201ccorrectly\nperceived\u201d the commands of his religion,Thomas, supra,at\n716. Instead, it is our job to look beyond the formality of written\nwords and afford legal protection to any sincere act of faith. See\ngenerallyHurleyv.Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and\nBisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.\u00a0S. 557, 569 (1995)\n(\u201c[T]he Constitution looks beyond written or spoken words as\nmediums of ex- pression,\u201d which are \u201cnot a condition of\nconstitutional protection\u201d).The second suggestion fares no better.\nSuggesting that this case is only about \u201cwedding cakes\u201d\u2014and not a\nwedding cake celebrating a same-sex wedding\u2014actually points up the\nproblem. At its most general level, the cake at issue in Mr.\nPhillips\u2019s case was just a mixture of flour and eggs; at its most\nspecific level, it was a cake celebrating the same-sex wedding of\nMr. Craig and Mr. Mullins. We are told here, however, to apply a\nsort of Goldilocks rule: describing the cake by its ingredients istoo general; understanding it as celebrating a same-sex\nwedding istoo specific; but regarding it as a generic\nwedding cake isjust right. The problem is, the Commission\ndidn\u2019t play with the level of generality in Mr. Jack\u2019s case in this\nway. It didn\u2019t declare, for example, that because the cakes Mr.\nJack requested were just cakes about weddings generally, and all\nsuch cakes were the same, the bakers had to produce them. Instead,\nthe Commission accepted the bakers\u2019 view that the specific cakes\nMr. Jack requested conveyed a message offensive to their\nconvictions and allowed them to refuse service. Having done that\nthere, it must do the same here.Any other conclusion would invite civil\nauthorities to gerrymander their inquiries based on the parties\nthey prefer. Why calibrate the level of generality in Mr.\nPhillips\u2019s case at \u201cwedding cakes\u201d exactly\u2014and not at, say, \u201ccakes\u201d\nmore generally or \u201ccakes that convey a message regarding same-sex\nmarriage\u201d more specifically? If \u201ccakes\u201d were the relevant level of\ngenerality, the Commission would have to order the bakers to make\nMr. Jack\u2019s requested cakes just as it ordered Mr. Phillips to make\nthe requested cake in his case. Conversely, if \u201ccakes that convey a\nmessage regarding same-sex marriage\u201d were the relevant level of\ngenerality, the Commission would have to respect Mr. Phillips\u2019s\nrefusal to make the requested cake just as it respected the bakers\u2019\nrefusal to make the cakes Mr. Jack requested. In short, when the\nsame level of generality is applied to both cases, it is no\nsurprise that the bakers have to be treated the same. Only by\nadjusting the dialsjust right\u2014fine-tuning the level of\ngenerality up or down for each case based solely on the identity of\nthe parties and the substance of their views\u2014can you engineer the\nCommission\u2019s outcome, handing a win to Mr. Jack\u2019s bakers but\ndelivering a loss to Mr. Phillips. Such results-driven reasoning is\nimproper. Neither the Commission nor this Court may apply a more\nspecific level of generality in Mr. Jack\u2019s case (a cake that\nconveys a message regarding same-sex marriage) while applying a\nhigher level of generality in Mr. Phillips\u2019s case (a cake that\nconveys no message regarding same-sex marriage). Of course, underSmitha vendor cannot escape a public accommodations law\njust because his religion frowns on it. But for any law to comply\nwith the First Amendment andSmith, it must be applied in a\nmanner that treats religion with neutral respect. That means the\ngovernment must apply thesamelevel of generality across\ncases\u2014and that did not happen here.There is another problem with sliding up the\ngenerality scale: it risks denying constitutional protection to\nreligious beliefs that draw distinctions more specific than the\ngovernment\u2019s preferred level of description. To some, all wedding\ncakes may appear indistinguishable. Butto Mr. Phillipsthat\nis not the case\u2014his faith teaches him otherwise. And his religious\nbeliefs are entitled to no less respectful treatment than the\nbakers\u2019 secular beliefs in Mr. Jack\u2019s case. This Court has\nexplained these same points \u201c[r]epeatedly and in many different\ncontexts\u201d over many years.Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. at 887. For\nexample, inThomasa faithful Jehovah\u2019s Witness and steel\nmill worker agreed to help manufacture sheet steel he knew might\nfind its way into armaments, but he was unwilling to work on a\nfabrication line producing tank turrets. 450 U.\u00a0S., at 711. Of\ncourse, the line Mr. Thomas drew wasn\u2019t the same many others would\ndraw and it wasn\u2019t even the same line many other members of the\nsame faith would draw. Even so, the Court didn\u2019t try to suggest\nthat making steel is just making steel. Or that to offend his\nreligion the steel needed to be of a particular kind or shape.\nInstead, it recognized that Mr. Thomas alone was entitled to define\nthe nature of his religious commitments\u2014and that those commitments,\nas defined by the faithful adherent, not a bureaucrat or judge, are\nentitled to protection under the First Amendment.Id.,at\n714\u2013716; see alsoUnited Statesv.Lee, 455\nU.\u00a0S. 252, 254\u2013255 (1982);Smith,supra,at 887\n(collecting authorities). It is no more appropriate for the United\nStates Supreme Court to tell Mr. Phillips that a wedding cake is\njust like any other\u2014without regard to the religious significance\nhis faith may attach to it\u2014than it would be for the Court to\nsuggest that for all persons sacramental bread isjustbread\nor a kippah isjusta cap.Only one way forward now remains. Having failed\nto afford Mr. Phillips\u2019s religious objections neutral consideration\nand without any compelling reason for its failure, the Commission\nmust afford him the same result it afforded the bakers in Mr.\nJack\u2019s case. The Court recognizes this by reversing the judgment\nbelow and holding that the Commission\u2019s order \u201cmust be set aside.\u201dAnte,at 18. Maybe in some future rulemaking or case the\nCommission could adopt a new \u201cknowing\u201d standard for all refusals of\nservice and offer neutral reasons for doing so. But, as the Court\nobserves, \u201c[h]owever later cases raising these or similar concerns\nare resolved in the future, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the rulings of the\nCommission and of the state court that enforced the Commission\u2019s\norder\u201d inthiscase \u201cmust be invalidated.\u201dIbid. Mr.\nPhillips has conclusively proven a First Amendment violation and,\nafter almost six years facing unlawful civil charges, he is\nentitled to judgment.",
