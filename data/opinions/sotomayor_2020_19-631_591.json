BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.,\nPETITIONERSv.AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF POLITICAL\nCONSULTANTS, INC., et al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[July 6, 2020]Justice Sotomayor, concurring in the\njudgment.I agree with much of the partial dissent\u2019s\nexplanation that strict scrutiny should not apply to all\ncontent-based distinctions. Cf.post, at 5\u20139 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting\nin part). In my view, however, the government-debt exception in 47\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227(b) still fails intermediate scrutiny\nbecause it is not \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant\ngovernmental interest.\u201dWardv.Rock Against Racism,491 U.S.\n781, 791 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even under\nintermediate scrutiny, the Government has not explained how a\ndebt-collection robocall about a government-backed debt is any less\nintrusive or could be any less harassing than a debt-collection\nrobocall about a privately backed debt. As the Fourth Circuit\nnoted, the government-debt exception is seriously underinclusive\nbecause it permits \u201cmany of the intrusive calls that the automated\ncall ban was enacted to prohibit.\u201dAmerican Assn. of Political\nConsultants, Inc.v.FCC, 923 F.3d 159, 168 (2019) (case\nbelow). The Government could have employed far less restrictive\nmeans to further its interest in collecting debt, such as\n\u201csecur[ing] consent from the debtors to make debt-collection calls\u201d\nor \u201cplac[ing] the calls itself.\u201dId., at 169, n.\u00a010;\nsee also \u00a7227(b)(1)(A). Nor has the Government \u201csufficiently\njustified the differentiation between government-debt collection\nspeech and other important categories of robocall speech, such as\npolitical speech, charitable fundraising, issue advocacy,\ncommercial advertising, and the like.\u201dAnte, at 9.Nevertheless, I agree that the offending\nprovision is severable. Seeante, at 2;post, at\n11\u201312 (opinion of Breyer, J.); see alsoCity of Laduev.Gilleo,512 U.S.\n43, 51\u201353 (1994) (explaining that an appropriate \u201csolution\u201d to\na law that covers \u201ctoo little speech because its exemptions\ndiscriminate on the basis of [the speaker\u2019s] messages\u201d could be to\n\u201cremove\u201d the discrimination).With those understandings, I concur in the\njudgment.",
