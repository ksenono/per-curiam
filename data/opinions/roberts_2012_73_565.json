BURL CAIN,\nWARDENon writ of certiorari to the orleans parish\ncriminal district court of louisiana[January 10, 2012]Chief Justice Roberts\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.The State of Louisiana\ncharged petitioner Juan Smith with killing five people during an\narmed robbery. At Smith\u2019s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner,\nlinked Smith to the crime. Boatner testified that he was\nsocializing at a friend\u2019s house when Smith and two other gunmen\nentered the home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly thereafter\nbegan shooting, resulting in the death of five of Boatner\u2019s\nfriends. In court Boatner identified Smith as the first gunman to\ncome through the door. He claimed that he had been face to face\nwith Smith during the initial moments of the robbery. No other\nwitnesses and no physical evidence implicated Smith in the\ncrime.The jury convicted\nSmith of five counts of first-degree murder. The Louisiana Court of\nAppeal affirmed Smith\u2019s conviction. State v. Smith, 797 So.\u00a02d\n193 (2001). The Louisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this\nCourt. 2001\u20132416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So.\u00a02d 1189; 537\nU.\u00a0S. 1201 (2003) .Smith then sought\npostconviction relief in the state courts. As part of his effort,\nSmith obtained files from the police investigation of his case,\nincluding those of the lead investigator, Detective John Ronquillo.\nRonquillo\u2019s notes contain statements by Boatner that conflict with\nhis testimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from\nthe night of the murder state that Boatner \u201ccould not . . . supply\na description of the perpetrators other then [sic] they were black\nmales.\u201d App. 252\u2013253. Ronquillo also made a handwritten account of\na conversation he had with Boatner five days after the crime, in\nwhich Boatner said he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t\nsee faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d Id., at 308.\nAnd Ronquillo\u2019s typewritten report of that conversation states that\nBoatner told Ronquillo he \u201ccould not identify any of the\nperpetrators of the murder.\u201d Id., at 259\u2013260.Smith requested that\nhis conviction be vacated, arguing, inter alia, that the\nprosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Ronquillo\u2019s notes violated this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83 (1963) .\nThe state trial court rejected Smith\u2019s Brady claim, and the\nLouisiana Court of Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied\nreview. We granted certiorari, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), and now\nreverse.Under Brady, the State\nviolates a defendant\u2019s right to due process if it withholds\nevidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. See 373 U.\u00a0S., at 87. The\nState does not dispute that Boatner\u2019s statements in Ronquillo\u2019s\nnotes were fa- vorable to Smith and that those statements were not\ndis- closed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether\nBoatner\u2019s statements were material to the determination of Smith\u2019s\nguilt. We have explained that \u201cevidence is \u2018material\u2019 within the\nmeaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had\nthe evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U.\u00a0S. 449 \u2013470 (2009).\nA reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant \u201cwould\nmore likely than not have received a different verdict with the\nevidence,\u201d only that the likelihood of a different result is great\nenough to \u201cundermine[] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S. 419, 434 (1995) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).We have observed that\nevidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the\nState\u2019s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in\nthe verdict. See United States v. Agurs, 427 U.\u00a0S. 97 \u2013113,\nand n. 21 (1976). That is not the case here. Boatner\u2019s testimony\nwas the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And Boatner\u2019s\nundisclosed statements directly contradict his testimony: Boatner\ntold the jury that he had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d that Smith was the gunman he\nstood \u201cface to face\u201d with on the night of the crime, but\nRonquillo\u2019s notes show Boatner saying that he \u201ccould not ID anyone\nbecause [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he]\nsaw them.\u201d App. 196, 200, 308. Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements\nwere plainly material.The State and the\ndissent advance various reasons why the jury might have discounted\nBoatner\u2019s undisclosed statements. They stress, for example, that\nBoatner made other remarks on the night of the murder indicating\nthat he could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but not\nthe others. That merely leaves us to speculate about which of\nBoatner\u2019s contradictory declarations the jury would have believed.\nThe State also contends that Boatner\u2019s statements made five days\nafter the crime can be explained by fear of retaliation. Smith\nresponds that the record contains no evidence of any such fear.\nAgain, the State\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury could\nhave disbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us no\nconfidence that it would have done so.The police files that\nSmith obtained in state postconviction proceedings contain other\nevidence that Smith contends is both favorable to him and material\nto the verdict. Because we hold that Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\nstatements alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith\u2019s\nconviction, we have no need to consider his arguments that the\nother undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under Brady.The judgment of the\nOrleans Parish Criminal District Court of Louisiana is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.It is so ordered.",
