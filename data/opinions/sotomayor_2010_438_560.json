    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTCARR V. UNITED STATES560 U. S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1301THOMAS CARR, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit[June 1, 2010]Justice Sotomayor delivered the\nopinion of the Court.Since 1994, federal law has\nrequired States, as a condition for the receipt of certain law\nenforcement funds, to maintain federally compliant systems for\nsex-offender registration and community notification. In an effort\nto make these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform, and\neffective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part of the Adam Walsh Child\nProtection and Safety Act, Pub. L. 109\u2013248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590.\nAmong its provisions, the Act established a federal criminal\noffense covering,inter alia, any person who (1) \u201cis\nrequired to register under [SORNA],\u201d (2) \u201ctravels in interstate or\nforeign commerce,\u201d and (3) \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a\nregistration.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72250(a). At issue in this case is\nwhether \u00a72250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate travel\noccurred prior to SORNA\u2019s effective date and, if so, whether the\nstatute runs afoul of the Constitution\u2019s prohibition onex\u00a0post factolaws. See Art.\u00a0I, \u00a79, cl. 3.\nLiability under \u00a72250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA\ntravel. We therefore do not address theex\u00a0post factoquestion.IIn May 2004, petitioner Thomas\nCarr pleaded guilty in Alabama state court to first-degree sexual\nabuse. He was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but two\nyears suspended. Receiving credit for time previously served, Carr\nwas released on probation on July 3, 2004, and he registered as a\nsex offender as required by Alabama law.In late 2004 or early 2005, prior\nto SORNA\u2019s enactment, Carr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He\ndid not comply with Indiana\u2019s sex-offender registration\nrequirements. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law\nenforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his involvement in a\nfight.On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed\nan indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in\nviolation of \u00a72250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting\nthat because he traveled to Indiana prior to SORNA\u2019s effective\ndate, it would violate theEx\u00a0Post FactoClause to\nprosecute him under \u00a72250. The District Court denied Carr\u2019s motion,\nand Carr entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving his right to\nappeal. He received a 30-month prison sentence.The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit consolidated Carr\u2019s appeal with that of a similarly\nsituated defendant, who, in addition to raising anex\u00a0post\nfactoclaim, asserted that \u00a72250, by its terms, does not apply\nto persons whose interstate travel preceded SORNA\u2019s enactment.\nBeginning with the statutory argument, the Court of Appeals held\nthat \u00a72250 \u201cdoes not require that the defendant\u2019s travel postdate\nthe Act.\u201dUnited Statesv.Dixon, 551 F.\u00a03d\n578, 582 (2008). The court relied principally on its understanding\nof SORNA\u2019s underlying purpose:\u201cThe evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that\nconvicted sex offenders registered in one state might move to\nanother state, fail to register there, and thus leave the public\nunprotected. The concern is as acute in a case in which the\noffender moved before the Act was passed as in one in which he\nmoved afterward.\u201dIbid. (citation omitted).The court drew an analogy to 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in or\naffecting commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.\u201d \u201cThe danger posed\nby such a felon is unaffected by when the gun crossed state lines \u2026\n, and so it need not have crossed after the statute was passed.\u201d\n551 F.\u00a03d, at 582 (citingScarboroughv.United\nStates,431 U.\nS. 563(1977)). According to the court, \u00a72250(a), like \u00a7922(g),\nuses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element\n\u201cto establish a constitutional predicate for the statute \u2026 rather\nthan to create a temporal requirement.\u201d 551 F.\u00a03d, at 583.Reading \u00a72250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel,\nthe Seventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s decision inUnited Statesv.Husted,\n545 F.\u00a03d 1240 (2008). In holding that \u00a72250\u2019s coverage \u201cis\nlimited to those individuals who travel in interstate commerce\nafter the Act\u2019s effective date,\u201d the Tenth Circuit emphasized\n\u201cCongress\u2019s use of the present tense form of the verb \u2018to travel\u2019 \u2026\n, which according to ordinary English grammar, does not refer to\ntravel that has already occurred.\u201dId., at 1243\u20131244.\nRejecting this analysis, the Seventh Circuit characterized\nCongress\u2019 choice of tenses as \u201c\u00a0\u2018not very revealing.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n551 F.\u00a03d, at 583 (quotingScarborough, 431 U. S., at\n571).Having dispensed with the statutory question,\nthe Seventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his\nco-appellant that predicating a \u00a72250 prosecution on pre-SORNA\ntravel violates theEx\u00a0Post FactoClause. Reliance on\na defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded, poses noex\u00a0post factoproblem so long as the defendant had\n\u201creasonable time\u201d to register after SORNA took effect but failed to\ndo so. 551 F.\u00a03d, at 585. Noting that Carr remained\nunregistered five months after SORNA became applicable to him, the\nSeventh Circuit affirmed his conviction.Id., at 586\u2013587.\nThe court reversed the conviction of Carr\u2019s co-appellant, finding\nthat he had not been given a sufficient grace period to\nregister.In view of the division among the Circuits as\nto the meaning of \u00a72250\u2019s \u201ctravel\u201d requirement,[Footnote 1] we granted certiorari, 557 U. S. __\n(2009), to decide the statute\u2019s applicability to pre-SORNA travel\nand, if necessary, to consider the statute\u2019s compliance with theEx\u00a0Post FactoClause.[Footnote 2]IIAs relevant here, \u00a72250\nprovides:\u201c(a)\u2002In General.\u2014Whoever\u2014\u201c(1)\u2002is required to register under the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act;\u201c(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the\npurposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act by\nreason of a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice), the law of the District of Columbia,\nIndian tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the\nUnited States; or\u201c(B)\u2002travels in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country;\nand\u201c(3)\u2002knowingly fails to register or update a\nregistration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and\nNotification Act;\u201cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10\nyears, or both.\u201dFor a defendant to violate this provision, Carr and\nthe Government agree, the statute\u2019s three elements must \u201cbe\nsatisfied in sequence, culminating in a post-SORNA failure to\nregister.\u201d Brief for United States 13; see also Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 4, 7, n. 6. A sequential reading, the parties recognize,\nhelps to assure a nexus between a defendant\u2019s interstate travel and\nhis failure to register as a sex offender. Persons convicted of sex\noffenses under state law who fail to register in their State of\nconviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under\n\u00a72250 even if they had not left the State after being convicted\u2014an\nillogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest\nin punishing such state offenders.[Footnote 3]While both parties accept that the elements of\n\u00a72250 should be read sequentially, they disagree on the event that\nsets the sequence in motion. In the Government\u2019s view, the statute\nis triggered by a sex-offense conviction, which must be followed by\ninterstate travel, and then a failure to register under SORNA. Only\nthe last of these events, the Government maintains, must occur\nafter SORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel\nmay both have predated the statute\u2019s enactment. Carr, in contrast,\nasserts that the statutory sequence begins when a person becomes\nsubject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. The person must then\ntravel in interstate commerce and thereafter fail to register. All\nof these events, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA\u2019s enactment\nbecause a sex offender could not have been required to register\nunder SORNA until SORNA became the law.Carr\u2019s interpretation better accords with the\nstatutory text. By its terms, the first element of \u00a72250(a) can\nonly be satisfied when a person \u201cis required to registerunder\nthe Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\u201d\n\u00a72250(a)(1) (emphasis added). In an attempt to reconcile its\npreferred construction with the words of the statute, the\nGovernment insists that this language is merely \u201ca shorthand way of\nidentifying those persons who have a [sex-offense] conviction in\nthe classes identified by SORNA.\u201d Brief for United States 19\u201320. To\nreach this conclusion, the Government observes that another\nprovision of SORNA, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716913(a), states that the\nAct\u2019s registration requirements apply to \u201csex offender[s].\u201d A \u201csex\noffender\u201d is elsewhere defined as \u201can individual who was convicted\nof a sex offense.\u201d \u00a716911(1). Thus, as the Government would have\nit, Congress used 12 words and two implied cross-references to\nestablish that the first element of \u00a72250(a) is that a person has\nbeen convicted of a sex offense. Such contortions can scarcely be\ncalled \u201cshorthand.\u201d It is far more sensible to conclude that\nCongress meant the first precondition to \u00a72250 liability to be the\none it listed first: a \u201crequire[ment] to register under [SORNA].\u201d\nOnce a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements,\nwhich can occur only after the statute\u2019s effective date, that\nperson can be convicted under \u00a72250 if he thereafter travels and\nthen fails to register.[Footnote\n4]That \u00a72250 sets forth the travel requirement\nin the present tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present\nperfect (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces the conclusion\nthat preenactment travel falls outside the statute\u2019s compass.\nConsistent with normal usage, we have frequently looked to\nCongress\u2019 choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute\u2019s temporal\nreach. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Wilson,503\nU. S. 329, 333 (1992) (\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is\nsignificant in construing statutes\u201d);Gwaltney of Smithfield,\nLtd.v.Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.,484 U. S. 49, 57 (1987)\n(\u201cCongress could have phrased its requirement in language that\nlooked to the past \u2026 , but it did not choose this readily available\noption\u201d);Barrettv.United States,423 U. S. 212, 216\n(1976) (observing that Congress used the present perfect tense to\n\u201cdenot[e] an act that has been completed\u201d). The Dictionary Act also\nascribes significance to verb tense. It provides that, \u201c[i]n\ndetermining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context\nindicates otherwise[,] \u2026 words used in the present tense include\nthe future as well as the present.\u201d 1 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71. By\nimplication, then, the Dictionary Act instructs that the present\ntense generally does not include the past. Accordingly, a statute\nthat regulates a person who \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to\nencompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute\ntook effect. Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent\nidentifies any instance in which this Court has construed a\npresent-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment\nconduct.[Footnote 5]In this instance, the statutory context\nstrongly supports a forward-looking construction of \u201ctravels.\u201d\nFirst, the word \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) by a series\nof other present tense verbs\u2014\u201centersorleaves,\norresidesin, Indian country.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This\nCourt has previously described a statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the\npresent tense\u201d as a \u201cstriking indic[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective\norientation.\u201dGwaltney, 484 U. S., at 59. The Seventh\nCircuit thought otherwise, reasoning that it would \u201cmak[e] no\nsense\u201d for \u201ca sex offender who has resided in Indian country since\nlong before the Act was passed [to be] subject to the Act but not\nsomeone who crossed state lines before the Act was passed.\u201d 551\nF.\u00a03d, at 583. As a textual matter, however, it is the Seventh\nCircuit\u2019s approach that makes little sense: If \u201ctravels\u201d means\n\u201ctraveled\u201d (i.e., a person \u201ctravels\u201d if he crossed state\nlinesbeforeSORNA\u2019s enactment), then the only way to\navoid an incongruity among neighboring verbs would be to construe\nthe phrase \u201cresides i[n] Indian country\u201d to encompass persons who\nonce resided in Indian country but who left before SORNA\u2019s\nenactment and have not since returned\u2014an implausible reading that\nneither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Government, nor the dissent\nendorses.Second, the other elements of a \u00a72250\nviolation are similarly set forth in the present tense. Sections\n2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who\n\u201cisrequired to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who \u201cknowinglyfailsto register or update a registration as required by\n[SORNA].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Government accepts that this last\nelement\u2014a knowing failure to register or update a registration\u2014must\npostdate SORNA\u2019s enactment. Had Congress intended preenactment\nconduct to satisfy the first two requirements of \u00a72250 but not the\nthird, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to convey\nthis meaning. Indeed, numerous federal statutes use the\npast-perfect tense to describe one or more elements of a criminal\noffense when coverage of preenactment events is intended. See,e.g., 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (Supp.\n2010) (proscribing hate crimes in which \u201cthe defendant employs a\nfirearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other\nweapon thathas traveledin interstate or foreign\ncommerce\u201d (emphasis added)); 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9) (2006 ed.)\n(proscribing firearm possession or transport by any person \u201cwhohas beenconvicted\u201d of a felony or a misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence (emphasis added)); \u00a72252(a)(2) (2006\ned., Supp. II) (making it unlawful for any person to receive or\ndistribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually\nexplicit conduct that \u201chas been mailed, orhas been\nshipped or transportedin or affecting interstate or foreign\ncommerce\u201d (emphasis added)). The absence of similar phrasing here\nprovides powerful evidence that \u00a72250 targets only postenactment\ntravel.[Footnote 6]IIIEchoing the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nassessment that Congress\u2019 use of present-tense verbs in \u00a72250 is\n\u201cnot very revealing,\u201d Brief for United States 17, the Government\noffers two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover\npre-SORNA travel: First, such a reading avoids an \u201canomaly\u201d in the\nstatute\u2019s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders; and\nsecond, it \u201cbetter effectuates the statutory purpose.\u201dId., at 22 (capitalization omitted). Neither argument\npersuades us to adopt the Government\u2019s strained reading of the\nstatutory text.ASection 2250 imposes criminal\nliability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender\n\u201cby reason of a conviction under Federal law \u2026 , the law of the\nDistrict of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of any\nterritory or possession of the United States,\u201d \u00a72250(a)(2)(A), and\nany other person required to register under SORNA who \u201ctravels in\ninterstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in,\nIndian country,\u201d \u00a72250(a)(2)(B). According to the Government, these\ncategories correspond to \u201ctwo alternate sources of power to achieve\nCongress\u2019s aim of broadly registering sex offenders.\u201dId.,\nat 22. Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the statute\u2019s coverage,\nthe Government maintains, \u201censures that the jurisdictional reach of\nSection 2250(a)(2) has a comparable breadth as applied to both\nfederal and state sex offenders.\u201dId., at 21.The Government\u2019s pronouncement\nthat \u00a72250 should have an \u201cequally broad sweep\u201d with respect to\nfederal and state offenders,id., at 22, is little more\nthanipse dixit. Had Congress intended to subject any\nunregistered state sex offender who has ever traveled in interstate\ncommerce to federal prosecution under \u00a72250, it easily could have\nadopted language to that effect. That it declined to do so\nindicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal and state\nsex offenders differently. There is nothing \u201canomal[ous]\u201d about\nsuch a choice. To the contrary, it is entirely reasonable for\nCongress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in\nensuring compliance with SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by\nfederal sex offenders\u2014persons who typically would have spent time\nunder federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reasonable for\nCongress to have given the States primary responsibility for\nsupervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and\nto have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only\nwhen, after SORNA\u2019s enactment, they use the channels of interstate\ncommerce in evading a State\u2019s reach.In this regard, it is notable that the federal\nsex-offender registration laws have, from their inception,\nexpressly relied on state-level enforcement. Indeed, when it\ninitially set national standards for state sex-offender\nregistration programs in 1994, Congress did not include any federal\ncriminal liability. Congress instead conditioned certain federal\nfunds on States\u2019 adoption of \u201ccriminal penalties\u201d on any person\n\u201crequired to register under a State program \u2026 who knowingly fails\nto so register and keep such registration current.\u201d Jacob\nWetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender\nRegistration Act, Pub. L. 103\u2013322, Tit. XVII, \u00a7170101(c), 108 Stat.\n2041, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a714071(d). Two years later, Congress\nsupplemented state enforcement mechanisms by subjecting to federal\nprosecution any covered sex offender who \u201cchanges address to a\nState other than the State in which the person resided at the time\nof the immediately preceding registration\u201d and \u201cknowingly fails to\u201d\nregister as required. Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and\nIdentification Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104\u2013236, \u00a72, 110 Stat. 3095,\n3096, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a714072(g)(3), (i).[Footnote 7] The prospective orientation of this\nprovision is apparent. No statutory gap necessitated coverage of\nunregistered offenders who \u201cchange[d] address\u201d before the statute\u2019s\nenactment; the prosecution of such persons remained the province of\nthe States.In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this\nbasic allocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen\nstate enforcement of registration requirements, Congress\nestablished, as a funding condition, that \u201c[e]ach jurisdiction,\nother than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall provide a\ncriminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that\nis greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply\nwith the requirements of this subchapter.\u201d \u00a716913(e).[Footnote 8] Meanwhile, Congress in \u00a72250\nexposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up to 10\nyears\u2019 imprisonment, persons required to register under SORNA over\nwhom the Federal Government has a direct supervisory interest or\nwho threaten the efficacy of the statutory scheme by traveling in\ninterstate commerce.Understanding the act of travel as an aspect\nof the harm Congress sought to punish serves to distinguish \u00a72250\nfrom the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh Circuit\nanalogized. See 551 F.\u00a03d, at 582\u2013583. InScarborough, this Court held that a prior version of the\nstatute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted felon\nwho \u201c\u00a0\u2018possesses \u2026 in commerce or affecting commerce \u2026 any\nfirearm,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 431 U. S., at 564 (quoting 18 U. S.\u00a0C. App.\n\u00a71202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the Government to prove\npostenactment movement of the firearm across state lines. According\nto the Court, Congress had given \u201cno indication of any concern with\neither the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time of\nacquisition.\u201d 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply \u201cto keep guns\nout of the hands of\u201d convicted felons,ibid., and, by\nusing the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce,\u201d it invoked\nthe full breadth of its Commerce Clause authority to achieve that\nend. No one inScarboroughdisputed, however, that the act\nof possession had to occur post- enactment; a felon who\n\u201cpossess[ed]\u201d a firearm only preenactment was plainly outside the\nstatute\u2019s sweep. In this case, the proper analogy is not, as the\nSeventh Circuit suggested, between the travel of a sex offender and\nthe movement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who\n\u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act of\ntravel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional\npredicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of possession,\nthe very conduct at which Congress took aim.BIn a final effort to justify its\nposition, the Government invokes one of SORNA\u2019s underlying\npurposes: to locate sex offenders who had failed to abide by their\nregistration obligations. SORNA, the Government observes, was\nmotivated at least in part by Congress\u2019 concern about these\n\u201cmissing\u201d sex offenders\u2014a problem the House Committee on the\nJudiciary expressly linked to interstate travel: \u201cThe most\nsignificant enforcement issue in the sex offender program is that\nover 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth in the Nation[,]\nare \u2018missing,\u2019 meaning they have not complied with sex offender\nregistration requirements. This typically occurs when the sex\noffender moves from one State to another.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013218, pt. 1, p.\u00a026 (2005). The goal of tracking down\nmissing sex offenders, the Government maintains, \u201cis surely better\nserved by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their new\nStates of residence immediately than by waiting for them to travel\nin interstate commerce and fail to register yet again.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 23\u201324. The Court of Appeals expressed a similar view.\nSee 551 F.\u00a03d, at 582.[Footnote 9]The Government\u2019s argument\nconfuses a general goal of SORNA with the specific purpose of\n\u00a72250. Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of\nmissing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme\nenacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had enabled\nsex offenders to slip through the cracks. See 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a716901 (\u201cCongress in this chapter establishes a comprehensive\nnational system for the registration of [sex] offenders\u201d). Among\nits many provisions, SORNA instructs States to maintain\nsex-offender registries that compile an array of information about\nsex offenders, \u00a716914; to make this information publicly available\nonline, \u00a716918; to share the information with other jurisdictions\nand with the Attorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive\nnational sex-offender registry, \u00a7\u00a716919\u201316921; and to \u201cprovide a\ncriminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that\nis greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply\nwith the requirements of this subchapter,\u201d \u00a716913(e). Sex\noffenders, in turn, are required to \u201cregister, and keep the\nregistration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender\nresides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender\nis a student,\u201d \u00a716913(a), and to appear in person periodically to\n\u201callow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and verify\nthe information in each registry in which that offender is required\nto be registered,\u201d \u00a716916. By facilitating the collection of\nsex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions,\nthese provisions, not \u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019\neffort to account for missing sex offenders.Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the\nnumber of noncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the\nspecific policy choice Congress made in enacting \u00a72250. While\nsubjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under \u00a72250 may well\nbe consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a\ncontrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal. Taking\naccount of SORNA\u2019s overall structure, we have little reason to\ndoubt that Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it says: to\nsubject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce. Cf.Mertensv.Hewitt Associates,508 U. S. 248, 261\n(1993) (\u201c[V]ague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic purpose\u2019 are \u2026\ninadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding thespecificissue under consideration\u201d).CNone of the legislative materials\nthe Government cites as evidence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this\nreading into question. To the contrary, the report of the House\nJudiciary Committee suggests not only that a prohibition on\npostenactment travel is consonant with Congress\u2019 goals, but also\nthat it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt. As the\nGovernment acknowledges, the bill under consideration by the\nCommittee contained a version of \u00a72250 that \u201cwould not have reached\npre-enactment interstate travel.\u201d Brief for United States 24,\nn.\u00a09. This earlier version imposed federal criminal penalties\non any person who \u201creceives a notice from an official that such\nperson is required to register under [SORNA] and \u2026 thereafter\ntravels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves\nIndian country.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, at 9; see alsoid., at 26 (\u201c[S]ex offenders will now face Federal\nprosecution \u2026 if they cross a State line and fail to comply with\nthe sex offender registration and notification requirements\ncontained in the legislation\u201d). Yet this did not stop the Committee\nfrom describing its legislation as a solution to the problem of\nmissing sex offenders. Seeid., at 23\u201324, 26, 45\u201346. The\nGovernment identifies nothing in the legislative record to suggest\nthat, in modifying this language during the course of the\nlegislative process, Congress intended to alter the statute\u2019s\ntemporal sweep.[Footnote 10]\nAt the very least, the close correspondence between the Committee\u2019s\ndiscussion of missing sex offenders and its recognition of the\ntravel element\u2019s prospective application would seem to confirm that\nreading \u00a72250 to reach only postenactment travel does not\ncontravene SORNA\u2019s underlying purposes, let alone result in an\nabsurdity that would compel us to disregard the statutory text. Cf.Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.v.Murphy,548\nU. S. 291, 296 (2006) (\u201cWe have stated time and again that\ncourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it\nmeans and means in a statute what it says there. When the statutory\nlanguage is plain, the sole function of the courts\u2014at least where\nthe disposition required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it\naccording to its terms\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Having concluded that \u00a72250 does\nnot extend to preenactment travel, we need not consider whether\nsuch a construction would present difficulties under the\nConstitution\u2019sEx\u00a0Post FactoClause. The judgment of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have\nconfronted the question directly, other Circuits have also touched\non it. Aligning itself with the Seventh Circuit, the Eleventh\nCircuit has analogized 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72250(a) to the\nfelon-in-possession statute, \u00a7922(g), and applied it to a sex\noffender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him.United Statesv.Dumont, 555 F.\u00a03d 1288,\n1291\u20131292 (2009)(per curiam). In contrast, the Eighth\nCircuit has stated in dictum that \u00a72250(a) \u201cpunishes convicted sex\noffenders who travel in interstate commerceafter the enactment\nof SORNA.\u201dUnited Statesv.May, 535\nF.\u00a03d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).Footnote 2There is a separate conflict among the Courts\nof Appeals as to when SORNA\u2019s registration requirements became\napplicable to persons convicted of sex offenses prior to the\nstatute\u2019s enactment. Several Circuits, including the Seventh, have\ntaken the position that the Act did not apply to such sex offenders\nuntil the Attorney General provided for their inclusion by issuing\nan interim regulation, 28 CFR \u00a772.3, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897, on February\n28, 2007. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Hatcher, 560 F.\u00a03d 222, 226\u2013229 (CA4 2009);United Statesv.Cain, 583 F.\u00a03d 408,\n414\u2013419 (CA6 2009);United Statesv.Dixon, 551\nF.\u00a03d 578, 582 (CA7 2008) (case below);United Statesv.Madera, 528 F.\u00a03d 852, 857\u2013859 (CA11 2008)(per curiam). Other Circuits have held that persons with\npre-SORNA sex-offense convictions became subject to the Act\u2019s\nregistration requirements upon the statute\u2019s enactment in July\n2006. See,e.g.,May, 535 F.\u00a03d, at 915\u2013919;United Statesv.Hinckley, 550 F.\u00a03d 926,\n929\u2013935 (CA10 2008). Because Carr traveled from Alabama to Indiana\nbefore both the enactment of SORNA and the Attorney General\u2019s\nregulation, we have no occasion to consider whether a pre-SORNA sex\noffender whose travel and failure to register occurred between July\n2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under \u00a72250, and we\nexpress no view on that question. We similarly express no view as\nto whether \u00a772.3 was properly promulgated\u2014a question that has also\ndivided the Circuits. CompareCain, 583 F.\u00a03d, at\n419\u2013424 (holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for\nissuing the interim regulation without adhering to the\nnotice-and-comment and publication requirements of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA)), withUnited Statesv.Dean, No. 09\u201313115, 2010 WL 1687618, *3\u2013*8 (CA11, Apr. 28,\n2010) (finding no APA violation);United Statesv.Gould, 568 F.\u00a03d 459, 469\u2013470 (CA4 2009) (same).Footnote 3For persons convicted of sex offenses under\nfederal or Indian tribal law, interstate travel is not a\nprerequisite to \u00a72250 liability. See \u00a72250(a)(2)(A).Footnote 4Offering a variation on the Government\u2019s\nargument, the dissent contends that, \u201c[i]n accordance with current\ndrafting conventions, \u00a72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the\nlaw went into effect, but as of the time when the first act\nnecessary for conviction is committed.\u201dPost, at 7\n(opinion of Alito, J.). This occurs, the dissent maintains, \u201cwhen\nan individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is\nthat act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.\u201dIbid. The dissent\u2019s account cannot be squared with the\nstatutory text. \u201c[T]he first act necessary for conviction\u201d under\n\u00a72250(a) is not a predicate sex-offense conviction. It is a\nrequirement \u201cto register under [SORNA].\u201d \u00a72250(a)(1). Thus, even if\nthe dissent is correct that legislative drafters do not invariably\nuse the moment of enactment to mark the dividing line between\ncovered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so here.Footnote 5The Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit\ndecision for the proposition that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the present tense is\ncommonly used to refer to past, present, and future all at the same\ntime.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 551 F.\u00a03d, at 583 (quotingCoalition for\nClean Airv.Southern\u00a0Cal. Edison Co., 971\nF.\u00a02d 219, 225 (CA9 1992)). Neither court offered examples of\nsuch usage. Perhaps, as the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there\nmay be instances in which \u201ccontext\u201d supports this sort of\nomnitemporality, but it is not the typical understanding of the\npresent tense in either normal discourse or statutory construction.\nTaken in context, the word \u201ctravels\u201d as it appears in \u00a72250 is\nindistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that appear in\nmyriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a\nprospective basis. Examining a criminal law with a travel element\nsimilar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently\nagreed that \u201cthe present tense verb \u2018travels,\u2019 most sensibly read,\ndoes not refer to travel that occurred in the past\u2014that is, before\nthe enactment of the statute.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jackson, 480 F.\u00a03d 1014, 1019 (CA9 2007)\n(interpreting 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72423(c), which imposes criminal\npenalties on \u201c[a]ny United States citizen \u2026 who travels in foreign\ncommerce, and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another\nperson\u201d).Footnote 6The dissent identifies several \u201cSORNA\nprovisions that plainly use the present tense to refer to events\nthat \u2026 may have occurred before SORNA took effect.\u201dPost,\nat 10. All of these examples appear in 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716911, a\ndefinitional section that merely elucidates the meaning of certain\nstatutory terms and proscribes no conduct. All but two of the\nprovisions, moreover, rely on the term \u201csex offender,\u201d which\n\u00a716911(1) defines to mean \u201can individual whowas convictedof a sex offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remaining provisions are\n\u00a716911(7), which simply uses \u201cinvolves\u201d rather than \u201cinvolved\u201d to\ndefine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cspecified offense\nagainst a minor,\u201d and \u00a716911(8), which makes plain that its\npresent-tense reference to an offender\u2019s age refers to age \u201cat the\ntime of the offense.\u201d These examples thus provide scant support for\nthe proposition that \u00a72250 uses \u201ctravels\u201d to refer to pre-SORNA\ntravel. Given the well-established presumption against\nretroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar\nonex\u00a0post factolaws, it cannot be the case that a\nstatutory prohibition set forth in the present tense applies by\ndefault to acts completed before the statute\u2019s enactment. SeeJohnsonv.United States,529 U. S. 694, 701\n(2000) (\u201cAbsent a clear statement of that intent, we do not give\nretroactive effect to statutes burdening private interests\u201d).Footnote 7Pre-SORNA law also exposed to federal\ncriminal liability any person whose State \u201cha[d] not established a\nminimally sufficient sexual offender registration program\u201d and who\nwas thus required to register with the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI). See 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a714072(c), (g)(2), (i).\nSORNA does not include a similar FBI registration requirement,\npresumably because, by the time of the statute\u2019s enactment, \u201cevery\nState \u2026 had enacted some\u201d type of registration system.Smithv.Doe,538 U. S. 84, 90\n(2003).Footnote 8The law in Indiana, Carr\u2019s State of\nresidence, makes the failure to register a Class D felony, which\ncarries a prison term of up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. Ind. Code\n\u00a7\u00a711\u20138\u20138\u201317(a), 35\u201350\u20132\u20137(a) (2009).Footnote 9Also making this point, the dissent maintains\nthat \u201c[i]nterpreting \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment\ntravel severely impairs \u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness\u201d by \u201cplac[ing]\nbeyond the reach of the federal criminal laws\u201d \u201cthe many sex\noffenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registration\nregimes.\u201dPost, at 14. The dissent sees \u201cno apparent\nreason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a\nrequirement.\u201dIbid. Yet the dissent approves an even\ngreater impairment. Addressing a dispute we leave unresolved, see\nn.\u00a02,supra, the dissent would hold that, in enacting\nSORNA, \u201cCongress remained neutral on the question whether the Act\nreaches those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.\u201dPost, at 10. The dissent\u2019s view, in other words, is that\nSORNA does not apply of its own force toanysex offenders\nconvicted prior to the statute\u2019s enactment\u2014a reading wholly\ninconsistent with the dissent\u2019s description of SORNA as \u201ca response\nto a dangerous gap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration\nlaws.\u201dPost, at 13. If, as the dissent accepts, Congress\nleft open the possibility thatnopreenactment offenders\nwould face liability under \u00a72250, then it is certainly not\nunreasonable to conclude that Congress limited the statute\u2019s\ncoverage to offenders who travel after its enactment. Indeed, it is\nstrange to think that Congress might have enacted a statute that\ndeclined to cover pre-SORNA offenders but nevertheless covered\npre-SORNA travel.Footnote 10Among other changes, Congress eliminated the\nlanguage that conditioned liability on proof of notice, and it\nremoved the word \u201cthereafter,\u201d presumably as redundant in light of\nthe sequential structure of the enacted statute.",
