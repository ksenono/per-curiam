S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-7412TERRANCE JAMAR GRAHAM, PETITIONERv.FLORIDAon writ of certiorari to the district court of\nappeal of florida, first district[May 17, 2010]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, and with whom Justice Alito joins as to Parts I and\nIII, dissenting.The Court holds today that it is\n\u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and hence unconstitutional for any judge\nor jury to impose a sentence of life without parole on an offender\nless than 18 years old, unless he has committed a homicide.\nAlthough the text of the Constitution is silent regarding the\npermissibility of this sentencing practice, and although it would\nnot have offended the standards that prevailed at the founding, the\nCourt insists that the standards of American society have evolved\nsuch that the Constitution now requires its prohibition.The news of this evolution will, I think, come\nas a surprise to the American people. Congress, the District of\nColumbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to consider this\nsentencing practice in juvenile nonhomicide cases, and those judges\nand juries have decided to use it in the very worst cases they have\nencountered.The Court does not conclude that life without\nparole itself is a cruel and unusual punishment. It instead rejects\nthe judgments of those legislatures, judges, and juries regarding\nwhat the Court describes as the \u201cmoral\u201d question of whether this\nsentence can ever be \u201cproportionat[e]\u201d when applied to the category\nof offenders at issue here.Ante, at 7 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted),ante, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring).I am unwilling to assume that we, as members\nof this Court, are any more capable of making such moral judgments\nthan our fellow citizens. Nothing in our training as judges\nqualifies us for that task, and nothing in Article III gives us\nthat authority.I respectfully dissent.IThe Court recounts the facts of\nTerrance Jamar Graham\u2019s case in detail, so only a summary is\nnecessary here. At age 16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked\naccomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida restaurant,\nduring which one of Graham\u2019s accomplices twice struck the\nrestaurant manager on the head with a steel pipe when he refused to\nturn over money to the intruders. Graham was arrested and charged\nas an adult. He later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including\narmed burglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable by\nlife imprisonment under Florida law. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7810.02(2)(a),\n810.02(2)(b) (2007). The trial court withheld adjudication on both\ncounts, however, and sentenced Graham to probation, the first 12\nmonths of which he spent in a county detention facility.Graham reoffended just six months\nafter his release. At a probation revocation hearing, a judge found\nby a preponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11\nmonths, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices and held the\nhomeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30 minutes while his\naccomplices ransacked the residence. As a result, the judge\nconcluded that Graham had violated his probation and, after\nadditional hearings, adjudicated Graham guilty on both counts\narising from the restaurant robbery. The judge imposed the maximum\nsentence allowed by Florida law on the armed burglary count, life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole.Graham argues, and the Court holds, that this\nsentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause because a life-without-parole sentence is always\n\u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d when imposed on a person under 18 who\ncommits any crime short of a homicide. Brief for Petitioner 24;ante, at 21.IIAThe Eighth Amendment, which\napplies to the States through the Fourteenth, provides that\n\u201c[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines\nimposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d It is by now\nwell established that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was\noriginally understood as prohibiting torturous\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018methodsof punishment,\u2019\u00a0\u201dHarmelinv.Michigan,501 U. S. 957, 979\n(1991) (opinion of Scalia,\u00a0J.) (quoting Granucci, \u201cNor Cruel\nand Unusual Punishments Inflicted\u201d: The Original Meaning, 57 Cal.\nL. Rev. 839, 842 (1969))\u2014specifically methods akin to those that\nhad been considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of\nRights was adopted,Bazev.Rees,553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable exception,\nseeWeemsv.United States,217 U. S. 349(1910);Harmelin,supra, at 990\u2013994 (opinion of\nScalia,\u00a0J.) (discussing the scope and relevance ofWeems\u2019 holding), this Court applied the Clause with that\nunderstand- ing for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amendment\u2019s\nratification.More recently, however, the Court\nhas held that the Clause authorizes it to proscribe not only\nmethods of punishment that qualify as \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d but also\nany punishment that the Court deems \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to\nthe crime committed.Ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This latter interpretation is entirely the Court\u2019s\ncreation. As has been described elsewhere at length, there is\nvirtually no indication that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause originally was understood to require proportionality in\nsentencing. SeeHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 975\u2013985 (opinion\nof Scalia,\u00a0J.). Here, it suffices to recall just two points.\nFirst, the Clause does not expressly refer to proportionality or\ninvoke any synonym for that term, even though the Framers were\nfamiliar with the concept, as evidenced by several founding-era\nstate constitutions that required (albeit without defining)\nproportional punishments. Seeid., at 977\u2013978. In\naddition, the penal statute adopted by the First Congress\ndemonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was not considered\na constitutional command.[Footnote\n1] Seeid., at 980\u2013981 (noting that the statute\nprescribed capital punishment for offenses ranging from\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018run[ning] away with \u2026 goods or merchandise to the value of\nfifty dollars,\u2019\u00a0\u201d to \u201cmurder on the high seas\u201d (quoting 1\nStat. 114)); see also Preyer, Penal Measures in the American\nColonies: An Overview, 26 Am. J. Legal Hist. 326, 348\u2013349, 353\n(1982) (explaining that crimes in the late 18th-century colonies\ngenerally were punished either by fines, whipping, or public\n\u201cshaming,\u201d or by death, as intermediate sentencing options such as\nincarceration were not common).The Court has nonetheless invoked\nproportionality to declare that capital punishment\u2014though not\nunconstitutionalper se\u2014is categorically too harsh a\npenalty to apply to certain types of crimes and certain classes of\noffenders. SeeCokerv.Georgia,433 U. S. 584(1977) (plurality\nopinion) (rape of an adult woman);Kennedyv.Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008) (rape of a child);Enmundv.Florida,458 U. S. 782(1982) (felony murder in\nwhich the defendant participated in the felony but did not kill or\nintend to kill);Thompsonv.Oklahoma,487 U. S. 815(1988) (plurality\nopinion) (juveniles under 16);Roperv.Simmons,543 U. S. 551(2005) (juveniles under\n18);Atkinsv.Virginia,536 U. S. 304(2002) (mentally\nretarded offenders). In adopting these categorical proportionality\nrules, the Court intrudes upon areas that the Constitution reserves\nto other (state and federal) organs of government. The Eighth\nAmendment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and\nunusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other constitutional\nprovisions ensure the defendant\u2019s right to fair process before any\npunishment is imposed. But, as members of today\u2019s majority note,\n\u201c[s]ociety changes,\u201dante, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring),\nand the Eighth Amendment leaves the unavoidably moral question of\nwho \u201cdeserves\u201d a particular nonprohibited method of punishment to\nthe judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the\nprosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that impose it\nunder circumstances they deem appropriate.The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical\nrules that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from the\ndeath penalty on the theory that \u201cevolving standards of decency\u201d\nrequire this result.Ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Court has offered assurances that these standards can\nbe reliably measured by \u201c\u00a0\u2018objective indicia\u2019\u00a0\u201d of\n\u201cnational consensus,\u201d such as state and federal legislation, jury\nbehavior, and (surprisingly, given that we are talking about\n\u201cnational\u201d consensus) international opinion.Ante, at 10\n(quotingRoper,supra, at 563); see alsoante, at 8\u201315, 29\u201331. Yet even assuming that is true, the\nFramers did not provide for the constitutionality of a particular\ntype of punishment to turn on a \u201csnapshot of American public\nopinion\u201d taken at the moment a case is decided.Roper,supra, at 629 (Scalia, J., dissenting). By holding\notherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one direction the\nevolution of the standards it describes, thus \u201ccalling a\nconstitutional halt to what may well be a pendulum swing in social\nattitudes,\u201dThompson,supra, at 869 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting), and \u201cstunt[ing] legislative con- sideration\u201d of new\nquestions of penal policy as they emerge,Kennedy,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Alito, J.,\ndissenting).But the Court is not content to rely on\nsnapshots of community consensus in any event.Ante, at 16\n(\u201cCommunity consensus, while \u2018entitled to great weight,\u2019 is not\nitself determinative\u201d (quotingKennedy,supra, at\n__ (slip op., at 24)). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the\nevidence of consensus it finds whenever its own \u201cindependent\njudgment\u201d points in a different direction.Ante,at 16.\nThe Court thus openly claims the power not only to approve or\ndisapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on evidence\nof how society\u2019s standardshaveevolved, but also on the\nbasis of the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d perception of how those\nstandardsshouldevolve, which depends on what the Court\nconcedes is \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cnecessarily . . . a moral\njudgment\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d regarding the propriety of a given\npunishment in today\u2019s society.Ante, at 7 (quotingKennedy,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).The categorical proportionality review the\nCourt employs in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.\nThe Court\u2019s decision today is significant because it does not\nmerely apply this standard\u2014it remarkably expands its reach. For the\nfirst time in its history, the Court declares an entire class of\noffenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical\napproach it previously reserved for death penalty cases alone.BUntil today, the Court has based\nits categorical proportionality rulings on the notion that the\nConstitution gives special protection to capital defendants because\nthe death penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be\nreserved for only those who are \u201cmost deserving of execution.\u201dAtkins,supra, at 319; seeRoper,supra, at 568;Eddingsv.Oklahoma,455 U. S. 104(1982);Lockettv.Ohio,438 U. S. 586(1978). Of\ncourse, the Eighth Amendment itself makes no distinction between\ncapital and noncapital sentencing, but the \u201c\u00a0\u2018bright\nline\u2019\u00a0\u201d the Court drew between the two penalties has for many\nyears served as the principal justification for the Court\u2019s\nwillingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death\npenalty. SeeRummelv.Estelle,445 U. S. 263, 275\n(1980).Today\u2019s decision eviscerates that\ndistinction. \u201cDeath is different\u201d no longer. The Court now claims\nnot only the power categorically to reserve the \u201cmost severe\npunishment\u201d for those the Court thinks are \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most\ndeserving of execution,\u2019\u00a0\u201dRoper,543 U. S., at 568\n(quotingAtkins,536 U. S., at 319),but alsoto\ndeclare that \u201cless culpable\u201d persons are categorically exempt from\nthe \u201csecondmost severe penalty.\u201dAnte, at 21\n(emphasis added). No reliable limiting principle remains to prevent\nthe Court from immunizing any class of offenders from the law\u2019s\nthird, fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as\nwell.The Court\u2019s departure from the \u201cdeath is\ndifferent\u201d distinction is especially mystifying when one considers\nhow long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a time\nthe Court declined to apply proportionality principles to\nnoncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that \u201ca sentence of death\ndiffers in kind from any sentence of imprisonment,no matter\nhow long.\u201dRummel, 445 U. S., at 272 (emphasis\nadded). Based on that rationale, the Court found that the\nexcessiveness of one prison term as compared to another was\n\u201cproperly within the province of legislatures, not courts,\u201did., at 275\u2013276, precisely because it involved an\n\u201cinvariably\u2026subjective determination, there\nbeing no clear way to make \u2018any constitutional distinction between\none term of years and a shorter or longer term of years,\u2019\u00a0\u201dHuttov.Davis,454 U. S. 370, 373\n(1982)(per curiam)(quotingRummel,supra, at 275; emphasis added).Even when the Court broke from that\nunderstanding in its 5-to-4 decision inSolemv.Helm,463 U. S. 277(1983) (striking down as\n\u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d a life-without-parole sentence imposed\non a defendant for passing a worthless check), the Court did so\nonly as applied to the facts of that case; it announced no\ncategorical rule.Id.,at 288, 303. Moreover, the Court\nsoon cabinedSolem\u2019s rationale. The controlling opinion in\nthe Court\u2019s very next noncapital proportionality case emphasized\nthat principles of federalism require substantial deference to\nlegislative choices regarding the proper length of prison\nsentences.Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of\nKennedy, J.) (\u201c[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of\nsentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms are the\ninevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal structure\u201d);id., at 1000 (\u201c[D]iffering attitudes and perceptions of\nlocal conditions may yield different, yet rational, conclusions\nregarding the appropriate length of prison terms for particular\ncrimes\u201d). That opinion thus concluded that \u201csuccessfulchallenges to the proportionality of [prison] sentences [would be]\nexceedingly rare.\u201dId., at 1001 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years\nsinceSolem, the Court has considered just three such\nchallenges and has rejected them all, seeEwingv.California,538 U. S. 11(2003);Lockyerv.Andrade,538 U. S. 63(2003);Harmelin,supra, largely on the theory that\ncriticisms of the \u201cwisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness\u201d of\nterm-of-years prison sentences are \u201cappropriately directed at the\nlegislature[s],\u201d not the courts,Ewing,supra,at\n27, 28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that those\ndecisions were \u201cclosely divided,\u201dante, at 8, but so wasSolemitself, and it is now fair to describeSolemas an outlier.[Footnote 2]Remarkably, the Court today does more than\nreturn toSolem\u2019s case-by-case proportionality standard\nfor noncapital sentences; it hurtles past it to impose acategoricalproportionality rule banning\nlife-without-parole sentences not just in this case, but ineverycase involving a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no\nmatter what the circumstances. Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the\nCourt\u2019s precedents justify this decision.IIIThe Court asserts that\ncategorical proportionality review is necessary here merely because\nGraham asks for a categorical rule, seeante, at 10, and\nbecause the Court thinks clear lines are a good idea, seeante, at 24\u201325. I find those factors wholly insufficient\nto justify the Court\u2019s break from past practice. First, the Court\nfails to acknowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire\ncategory of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a much\nheavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief underSolem. Unlike the petitioner inSolem, Graham\nmust establish not only that his own life-without-parole sentence\nis \u201cgrossly disproportionate,\u201d but also that such a sentence is\nalways grossly disproportionate whenever it is applied to a\njuvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how heinous his crime. Cf.United Statesv.Salerno,481 U. S. 739(1987).\nSecond, even applying the Court\u2019s categorical \u201cevolving standards\u201d\ntest, neither objective evidence of national consensus nor the\nnotions of culpability on which the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment\u201d\nrelies can justify the categorical rule it declares here.AAccording to the Court, proper\nEighth Amendment analysis \u201cbegins with objective indicia of\nnational consensus,\u201d[Footnote\n3] and \u201c[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evidence of\ncontemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country\u2019s\nlegislatures,\u201dante, at 10\u201311 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As such, the analysis should end quickly, because a\nnational \u201cconsensus\u201d in favor of the Court\u2019s result simply does not\nexist. The laws of all 50 States, the Federal Government, and the\nDistrict of Columbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may\nbe tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.[Footnote 4] Seeante, at 33\u201335\n(Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty-five States, the Federal\nGovernment, and the District of Columbia expose juvenile offenders\ncharged in adult court to the very same range of punishments faced\nby adults charged with the same crimes. Seeante, at\n33\u201334, Part I. Eight of those States do not make\nlife-without-parole sentences available for any nonhomicide\noffender, regardless of age.[Footnote 5] All remaining jurisdictions\u2014the Federal\nGovernment, the other 37 States, and the District\u2014authorize\nlife-without-parole sentences for certain nonhomicide offenses, and\nauthorize the imposition of such sentences on persons under 18. Seeibid. OnlyfiveStates prohibit juvenile\noffenders from receiving a life-without-parole sentence that could\nbe imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime.[Footnote 6]No plausible claim of a consensus\nagainst this sentencing practice can be made in light of this\noverwhelming legislative evidence. The sole fact that federal law\nauthorizes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our\nNation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality that 37\nout of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit the practice makes\nthe claim utterly implausible. Not only is there no consensus\nagainst this penalty, there is a clear legislative consensusin\nfavorof its availability.Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this\nevidence aside as \u201cincomplete and unavailing,\u201d declaring that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]here are measures of consensus other than\nlegislation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 11 (quotingKennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22)). This is\nnothing short of stunning. Most importantly, federal civilian law\napproves this sentencing practice.[Footnote 7] And although the Court has never decided how\nmany state laws are necessary to show consensus, the Court has\nnever banished into constitutional exile a sentencing practice that\nthe laws of a majority, let alone a supermajority, of States\nexpressly permit.[Footnote\n8]Moreover, the consistency and direction of\nrecent leg-islation\u2014a factor the Court previously has relied upon\nwhen crafting categorical proportionality rules, seeAtkins, 536 U. S., at 315\u2013316;Roper, 543 U. S.,\nat 565\u2013566\u2014underscores the consensusagainstthe rule the\nCourt announces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a\nnational consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a\nconsensus in favor of the two penological points it later\ndiscusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than\nsimilarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit nonhomicide\ncrimes should always receive an opportunity to demonstrate\nrehabilitation through parole.Ante, at 16\u201317, 22\u201324. But\nlegislative trends make that assumption untenable.First, States over the past 20 years have\nconsistentlyincreasedthe severity of punishments for\njuvenile offenders. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to\nthe 1990\u2019s as \u201ca time of unprecedented change as State legislatures\ncrack[ed] down on juvenile crime\u201d);ibid.(noting that,\nduring that period, \u201clegislatures in 47 States and the District of\nColumbia enacted laws that made their juvenile justice systems more\npunitive,\u201d principally by \u201cma[king] it easier to transfer juvenile\noffenders from the juvenile justice system to the [adult] criminal\njustice system\u201d);id., at 104. This, in my view, reveals\nthe States\u2019 widespread agreement that juveniles can sometimes act\nwith the same culpability as adults and that the law should permit\njudges and juries to consider adult sentences\u2014including life\nwithout parole\u2014in those rare and unfortunate cases. See Feld,\nUnmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal Responsibility and LWOP\nSentences, 10 J. Law & Family Studies 11, 69\u201370 (2007) (noting\nthat life-without-parole sentences for juveniles have increased\nsince the 1980\u2019s); Amnesty International & Human Rights Watch,\nThe Rest of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in\nthe United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).Second, legislatures have moved away from\nparole over the same period. Congress abolished parole for federal\noffenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to\n\u201cgamesmanship and cynicism,\u201d Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines\nRevisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180 (1999) (discussing the\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987), and several States\nhave followed suit, see T. Hughes, D. Wilson, & A. Beck, Dept.\nof Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Trends in State Parole,\n1990\u20132000, p. 1 (2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States\nhad abolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States had\nabolished it for certain ones). In light of these developments, the\nargument that there is nationwide consensus that parole must be\navailable to offenders less than 18 years old ineverynonhomicide case simply fails.BThe Court nonetheless dismisses\nexisting legislation, pointing out that life-without-parole\nsentences are rarely imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders\u2014129\ntimes in recent memory[Footnote\n9] by the Court\u2019s calculation, spread out across 11 States and\nthe federal courts.Ante, at 11\u201313. Based on this rarity\nof use, the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice,\nimplying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus of a\nprior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures\ntone-deaf to moral values of their constituents that this Court\nclaims to have easily discerned from afar. Seeante, at\n11.This logic strains credulity. It\nhas been rejected before.Greggv.Georgia,428 U. S. 153,\n182 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)\n(\u201c[T]he relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death\nsentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishmentper\nse. Rather, [it] \u2026 may well reflect the humane feeling that\nthis most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small\nnumber of extreme cases\u201d). It should also be rejected here. That a\npunishment is rarely imposed demonstrates nothing more than a\ngeneral consensus that it should be just that\u2014rarely imposed. It is\nnot proof that the punishment is one the Nation abhors.The Court nonetheless insists that the 26\nStates that authorize this penalty, but are not presently\nincarcerating a juvenile nonhomicide offender on a\nlife-without-parole sentence, cannot be counted as approving its\nuse. The mere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this\npenalty, the Court explains, \u201cdoes not indicate that the penalty\nhas been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative\nconsideration.\u201dAnte, at 16.As an initial matter, even accepting the\nCourt\u2019s theory,federallaw authorizes this penalty and\nthe Federal Government uses it. Seeante, at 13 (citing\nLetter and Attachment from Judith Simon Garrett, U. S. Dept. of\nJustice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, to Supreme Court Library (Apr.\n12, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)). That should\nbe all the evidence necessary to refute the claim of a national\nconsensus against this penalty.Yet even when examining the States that\nauthorize, but have not recently employed, this sentencing\npractice, the Court\u2019s theory is unsound. Under the Court\u2019s evolving\nstandards test, \u201c[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to establish a\nnational consensusapprovingwhat their citizens have\nvoted to do; rather, it is the \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of petitioners to\nestablish a national consensusagainstit.\u201dStanfordv.Kentucky,492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (quotingGregg,supra, at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart,\nPowell, and Stevens, JJ.); some emphasis added). In light of this\nfact, the Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction\u2019s disuse of a\nlegislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition to it.\nThe fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this sentencing\npractice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the citizens of that\njurisdiction find tolerable the possibility that a jury of their\npeers could impose a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile\nwhose nonhomicide crime is sufficiently depraved.The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder\nillustrates this point. Just weeks before the release of this\nopinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life without parole\nafter hearing evidence that he viciously attacked a 17-year-old\ngirl who gave him a ride home from a party. See Stogsdill, Teen\nGets Life Terms in Stabbing, Rape Case, Tulsa World, Apr. 2, 2010,\np. A10; Stogsdill, Delaware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault\nCase, Tulsa World, May 4, 2010, p. A12. Budder allegedly put the\ngirl\u2019s head \u201c\u00a0\u2018into a headlock and sliced her throat,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nraped her, stabbed her about 20 times, beat her, and pounded her\nface into the rocks alongside a dirt road. Teen Gets Life Terms in\nStabbing, Rape Case, at A10. Miraculously, the victim survived.Ibid.Budder\u2019s crime was rare in its\nbrutality. The sentence the jury imposed was also rare. According\nto the study relied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such\noffender in its prison system before Budder\u2019s offense. P. Annino,\nD. Rasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for\nNon-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14 (Sept. 14,\n2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, therefore, the Court would\nhave counted Oklahoma\u2019s citizens as morally opposed to\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles nonhomicide\noffenders.Yet Oklahoma\u2019s experience proves the\ninescapable flaw in that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted\nlaws that allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole\nsentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries invoke\nthose laws rarely\u2014in the unusual cases that they find exceptionally\ndepraved. I cannot agree with the Court that Oklahoma citizens\nshould be constitutionally disabled from using this sentencing\npractice merely because they have not done so more frequently. If\nanything, the rarity of this penalty\u2019s use underscores just how\njudicious sentencing judges and juries across the country have been\nin invoking it.This fact is entirely consistent with the\nCourt\u2019s intuition that juvenilesgenerallyare less\nculpable and more capable of growth than adults. Seeinfra, at 21\u201322. Graham\u2019s own case provides another\nexample. Graham was statutorily eligible for a life-without-parole\nsentence after his first crime. But the record indicates that the\ntrial court did not give such a sentence serious consideration at\nGraham\u2019s initial plea hearing. It was only after Graham\nsubsequently violated his parole by invading a home at gunpoint\nthat the maximum sentence was imposed.In sum, the Court\u2019s calculation that 129\njuvenile nonhomicide life-without-parole sentences have been\nimposed nationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly\namounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice offends our\ncommon sense of decency.[Footnote 10]Finally, I cannot help but note that the\nstatistics the Court finds inadequate to justify the penalty in\nthis case are stronger than those supporting at least one other\npenalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court, joined by\nthe author of today\u2019s opinion, upheld the application of the death\npenalty against a 16-year-old, despite the fact that no such\npunishment had been carried out on a person of that age in this\ncountry in nearly 30 years. SeeStanford, 492 U. S., at\n374. Whatever the statistical frequency with which\nlife-without-parole sentences have been imposed on juvenile\nnonhomicide offenders in the last 30 years, it is surely greater\nthan zero.In the end, however, objective factors such as\nlegislation and the frequency of a penalty\u2019s use are merely\nornaments in the Court\u2019s analysis, window dressing that accompanies\nits judicial fiat.[Footnote\n11] By the Court\u2019s own decree, \u201c[c]ommunity consensus \u2026 is not\nitself determinative.\u201dAnte, at 16. Only the independent\nmoral judgment of this Court is sufficient to decide the question.\nSeeibid.CLacking any plausible claim\nto consensus, the Court shifts to the heart of its argument: its\n\u201cindependent judgment\u201d that this sentencing practice does not\n\u201cserv[e] legitimate penological goals.\u201d Ante, at 16. The Court\nbegins that analysis with the obligatory preamble that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one\npenological theory,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 20 (quotingHarmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)),\nthen promptly mandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems\nbest.First, the Court acknowledges\nthat, at a minimum, the imposition of life-without-parole sentences\non juvenile nonhomicide offenders serves two \u201clegitimate\u201d\npenological goals: incapacitation and deterrence.Ante, at\n20\u201321. By definition, such sentences serve the goal of\nincapacitation by ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed\nburglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex crimes\ndescribed by The Chief Justice, no longer threaten their\ncommunities. Seeante, at 9 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). That should settle the matter, since the Court\nacknowledges that incapacitation is an \u201cimportant\u201d penological\ngoal.Ante, at 21. Yet, the Court finds this goal\u201cinadequate\u201d to justify the life-without-parole sentences\nhere.Ante,at 22 (emphasis added). A similar fate befalls\ndeterrence. The Court acknowledges that such sentences will deter\nfuture juvenile offenders, at least to some degree, but rejects\nthat penological goal, not as illegitimate, but as insufficient.Ante, at 21 (\u201c[A]ny limited deterrent effect provided by\nlife without parole isnot enoughto justify the\nsentence.\u201d (emphasis added)).The Court looks more favorably on\nrehabilitation, but laments that life-without-parole sentences do\nlittle to promote this goal because they result in the offender\u2019s\npermanent incarceration.Ante, at 22. Of course, the Court\nrecognizes that rehabilitation\u2019s \u201cutility and proper\nimplementation\u201d are subject to debate.Ante,at 23. But\nthat does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may not\n\u201cforswea[r] \u2026 the rehabilitative ideal.\u201dIbid.In other\nwords, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate \u201cany one penological\ntheory,\u201dante, at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted),\njust one the Court approves.Ultimately, however, the Court\u2019s \u201cindependent\njudgment\u201d and the proportionality rule itself center on\nretribution\u2014the notion that a criminal sentence should be\nproportioned to \u201c\u00a0\u2018the personal culpability of the criminal\noffender.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 16, 20 (quotingTisonv.Arizona,481 U. S. 137, 149\n(1987)). The Court finds that retributive purposes are not served\nhere for two reasons.1First, quotingRoper,\n543 U. S., at 569\u2013570, the Court concludes that juveniles are less\nculpable than adults because, as compared to adults, they \u201chave a\n\u2018\u00a0\u201clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of\nresponsibility,\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201ctheir characters are \u2018not as\nwell formed.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 17. As a general matter,\nthis statement is entirely consistent with the evidence recounted\nabove that judges and juries impose the sentence at issue quite\ninfrequently, despite legislative authorization to do so in many\nmore cases. See Part III\u2013B,supra. Our society tends to\ntreat the average juvenile as less culpable than the average adult.\nBut the question here does not involve the average juvenile. The\nquestion, instead, is whether the Constitution prohibits judges and\njuries fromeverconcluding that an offender under the age\nof 18 has demonstrated sufficient depravity and incorrigibility to\nwarrant his permanent incarceration.In holding that the Constitution\nimposes such a ban, the Court cites \u201cdevelopments in psychology and\nbrain science\u201d indicating that juvenile minds \u201ccontinue to mature\nthrough late adolescence,\u201dante, at 17 (citing Brief for\nAmerican Medical Association et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae16\u201324; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. asAmiciCuriae22\u201327 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and\nthat juveniles are \u201cmore likely [than adults] to engage in risky\nbehaviors,\u201did., at 7. But even if such generalizations\nfrom social science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking, the\nCourt misstates the data on which it relies.The Court equates the propensity of a fairly\nsubstantial number of youths to engage in \u201crisky\u201d or antisocial\nbehaviors with the propensity of a much smaller group to commit\nviolent crimes.Ante, at 26. But research relied upon by\ntheamicicited in the Court\u2019s opinion differentiates\nbetween adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a fleeting\nsymptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pattern. See Moffitt,\nAdolescence-Limited and Life-Course-Persistent Antisocial Behavior:\nA Developmental Taxonomy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993)\n(cited in APA Brief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents\nwho are \u201cantisocial only during adolescence\u201d and a smaller group\nwho engage in antisocial behavior \u201cat every life stage\u201d despite\n\u201cdrift[ing] through successive systems aimed at curbing their\ndeviance\u201d). That research further suggests that the pattern of\nbehavior in the latter group often sets in before 18. See\nMoffitt, supra, at 684 (\u201cThe well-documented resistance of\nantisocial personality disorder to treatments of all kinds seems to\nsuggest that the life-course-persistent style is fixed sometime\nbefore age 18\u201d). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is\nevidence that an adolescent offender\u2019s antisocial behavior isnottransient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the\nTaxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-Limited\nAntisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status of Criminological\nTheory 277, 292\u2013293 (F. Cullen, J. Wright, & K. Blevins eds.\n2006) (observing that \u201clife-course persistent\u201d males \u201ctended to\nspecialize in serious offenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault,\nrobbery, violating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited\u201d ones\n\u201cspecialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5, public\ndrunkenness, giving false information on application forms,\npirating computer software, etc.)\u201d).In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this\npsychological or sociological data is sufficient to support the\nCourt\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018moral\u2019\u00a0\u201d conclusion that youth defeats\nculpability ineverycase.Ante, at 17 (quotingRoper, 543 U. S., at 570); seeid., at 618\n(Scalia, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case Against Adolescence\n171 (2007) (reporting on a study of juvenile reasoning skills and\nconcluding that \u201cmost teens are capable of conventional, adult-like\nmoral reasoning\u201d).The Court responds that a categorical rule is\nnonetheless necessary to prevent the \u201c\u00a0\u2018unacceptable\nlikelihood\u2019\u00a0\u201d that a judge or jury, unduly swayed by\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the brutality or cold-blooded nature\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a\njuvenile\u2019s nonhomicide crime, will sentence him to a\nlife-without-parole sentence for which he possesses\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018insufficient culpability,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 27\n(quotingRoper,supra, at 572\u2013573). I find that\njustification entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal\njustice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand between\nthe defendant and an outraged public and dispassionately determine\nhis guilt and the proper amount of punishment based on the evidence\npresented. That process necessarily admits of human error. But so\ndoes the process of judging in which we engage. As between the two,\nI find far more \u201cunacceptable\u201d that this Court, swayed by studies\nreflecting the general tendencies of youth, decree that the people\nof this country are not fit to decide for themselves when the rare\ncase requires different treatment.2That is especially so because, in\nthe end, the Court does not even believe its pronouncements about\nthe juvenile mind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces\ntoday would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and\nfederal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for\njuveniles who commit homicides. Seeante, at 23. The Court\nthus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in the psyche of a\nperson less than 18 that prevents him from acquiring the moral\nagency necessary to warrant a life-without-parole sentence.\nInstead, the Court rejects overwhelming legislative consensus only\non the question of whichactsare sufficient to\ndemonstrate that moral agency.The Court is quite willing to\naccept that a 17-year-old who pulls the trigger on a firearm can\ndemonstrate sufficient depravity and irredeemability to be denied\nreentry into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an\n8-year-old and leaves her for dead does not. Seeante, at\n17\u201319; cf.ante, at 9 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in\njudgment) (describing the crime of life-without-parole offender\nMilagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nlife-without-parole sentences are \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d for\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very little to do with\nits view of juveniles, and much more to do with its perception that\n\u201cdefendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life\nwill be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious\nforms of punishment than are murderers.\u201dAnte, at 18.That the Court is willing to impose such an\nexacting constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such\nan untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The question\nof what acts are \u201cdeserving\u201d of what punishments is bound so\ntightly with questions of morality and social conditions as to make\nit, almost by definition, a question for legislative resolution. It\nis true that the Court previously has relied on the notion of\nproportionality in holding certain classes of offenses\ncategorically exempt from capital punishment. Seesupra,\nat 4. But never before today has the Court relied on its own view\nof just deserts to impose a categorical limit on the imposition of\na lesser punishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established\nboundary raises the question whether any democratic choice\nregarding appropriate punishment is safe from the Court\u2019s\never-expanding constitutional veto.IVAlthough the concurrence avoids\nthe problems associated with expanding categorical proportionality\nreview to noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality\nanalysis in a way that raises the same fundamental concern.\nAlthough I do not believeSolemmeritsstare\ndecisistreatment, Graham\u2019s claim cannot prevail even under\nthat test (as it has been limited by the Court\u2019s subsequent\nprecedents).Soleminstructs a court first to compare the\n\u201cgravity\u201d of an offender\u2019s conduct to the \u201charshness of the\npenalty\u201d to determine whether an \u201cinference\u201d of gross\ndisproportionality exists. 463 U. S., at 290\u2013291. Only in \u201cthe rare\ncase\u201d in which such an inference is present should the court\nproceed to the \u201cobjective\u201d part of the inquiry\u2014an intra- and\ninterjurisdictional compari- son of the defendant\u2019s sentence with\nothers similarly situated.Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000,\n1005 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).Under the Court\u2019s precedents, I\nfail to see how an \u201cinference\u201d of gross disproportionality arises\nhere. The concurrence notes several arguably mitigating\nfacts\u2014Graham\u2019s \u201clack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and\nimmaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbringing.\u201dAnte, at 7 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment).\nBut the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole sentence\nimposed on a first-time offender who committed anonviolentdrug crime. SeeHarmelin,supra, at 1002\u20131004. Graham\u2019s conviction for an actual\nviolent felony is surely more severe than that offense. As for\nGraham\u2019s age, it is true thatRoperheld juveniles\ncategorically ineligible for capital punishment, but as the\nconcurrence explains,Roperwas based on the\u201cexplicit conclusion that [juveniles] \u2018cannot with\nreliability be classified among theworstoffenders\u2019\u00a0\u201d; it did \u201cnot establish that juveniles can never\nbe eligible for life without parole.\u201dAnte, at 5 (Roberts,\nC.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment) (quotingRoper, 543 U.\nS., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.)). In\nmy view,Roper\u2019s principles are thus not generally\napplicable outside the capital sentencing context.By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies\non the same type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it\nrestrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical\nruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham \u201cthe general\npresumption of diminished culpability\u201d for juveniles,ante, at 7, apparently because it believes that Graham\u2019s\narmed burglary and home invasion crimes were \u201ccertainly less\nserious\u201d than murder or rape,ibid. It recoils only from\nthe prospect that the Court would extend the same presumption to a\njuvenile who commits a sex crime. Seeante, at 10. I\nsimply cannot accept that these subjective judgments of\nproportionality are ones the Eighth Amendment authorizes us to\nmake.The \u201cobjective\u201d elements of theSolemtest provide no additional support for the concurrence\u2019s\nconclusion. The concurrence compares Graham\u2019s sentence to \u201csimilar\u201d\nsentences in Florida and concludes that Graham\u2019s sentence was \u201cfar\nmore severe.\u201dAnte, at 8 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J, concurring\nin judgment). But strangely, the concurrence uses average sentences\nfor burglary or robbery offenses as examples of \u201csimilar\u201d offenses,\neven though it seems that a run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is\nnot at all similar to Graham\u2019s criminal history, which includes a\ncharge for armed burglarywith assault,anda\nprobation violation for invading a home at gunpoint.And even if Graham\u2019s sentence is higher than\nones he might have received for an armed burglary with assault in\nother jurisdictions, seeante, at 8\u20139, this hardly seems\nrelevant if one takes seriously the principle that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]bsent\na constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional\nnotions of federalism, some State willalwaysbear the\ndistinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any\nother State.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHarmelin,supra, at 1000\n(opinion of Kennedy, J.) (quotingRummel, 445 U. S., at\n282; emphasis added). ApplyingSolem, the Court has upheld\na 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under California\u2019s recidivist\nstatute, despite the fact that the State and itsamicicould cite only \u201ca single instance of a similar sentence imposed\noutside the context of California\u2019s three strikes law, out of a\nprison population [then] approaching two million individuals.\u201dEwing, 538 U. S., at 47 (Breyer, J., dissenting). It has\nalso upheld a life-without-parole sentence for a first-time drug\noffender in Michigan charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine\ndespite the fact that only one other State would have authorized\nsuch a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that\nState required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilograms) to\ntrigger the penalty. SeeHarmelin,supra, at 1026\n(White, J., dissenting). Graham\u2019s sentence is certainly less rare\nthan the sentences upheld in these cases, so his claim fails even\nunderSolem.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Both the Court and the\nconcurrence claim their decisions to be narrow ones, but both\ninvite a host of line-drawing problems to which courts must seek\nanswers beyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds\nthat \u201c[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a\njuvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,\u201d but must\nprovide the offender with \u201csome meaningful opportunity to obtain\nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d\nAnte, at 24. But what, exactly, does such a \u201cmeaningful\u201d\nopportunity entail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment\nprinciples will govern review by the parole boards the Court now\ndemands that States empanel? The Court provides no answers to these\nquestions, which will no doubt embroil the courts for\nyears.[Footnote 12]VThe ultimate question in this\ncase is not whether a life-without-parole sentence \u2018fits\u2019 the crime\nat issue here or the crimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more\ngenerally, but to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The\nFlorida Legislature has concluded that such sentences should be\navailable for persons under 18 who commit certain crimes, and the\ntrial judge in this case decided to impose that legislatively\nauthorized sentence here. Because a life-without-parole prison\nsentence is not a \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d method of punishment under\nany standard, the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to\nreject those judgments.It would be unjustifiable for the\nCourt to declare otherwise even if it could claim that a bare\nmajority of state laws supported its independent moral view. The\nfact that the Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole\nsentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an\noverwhelming legislative majorityin favorof leaving that\nsentencing option available under certain cases simply il-lustrates\nhow far beyond any cognizable constitutional principle the Court\nhas reached to ensure that its own sense of morality and\nretributive justice pre-empts that of the people and their\nrepresentatives.I agree with Justice Stevens that \u201c[w]e learn,\nsometimes, from our mistakes.\u201dAnte, at 1 (concurring\nopinion). Perhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.I respectfully dissent.Footnote 1The Chief Justice\u2019s concurrence suggests that\nit is unnecessary to remark on the underlying question whether the\nEighth Amendment requires proportionality in sentencing because\n\u201c[n]either party here asks us to reexamine our precedents\u201d\nrequiring \u201cproportionality between noncapital offenses and their\ncorresponding punishments.\u201dAnte, at 2 (opinion concurring\nin judgment). I disagree. Both the Court and the concurrence do\nmore than apply existing noncapital proportionality precedents to\nthe particulars of Graham\u2019s claim. The Court radically departs from\nthe framework those precedents establish by applying to a\nnoncapital sentence the categorical proportionality review its\nprior decisions have reserved for death penalty cases alone. See\nPart III,infra. The concurrence, meanwhile, breathes new\nlife into the case-by-case proportionality approach that previously\ngoverned noncapital cases, from which the Court has steadily, and\nwisely, retreated sinceSolemv.Helm,463 U. S. 277(1983). See Part IV,infra. In dissenting from both choices to expand\nproportionality review, I find it essential to reexamine the\nfoundations on which that doctrine is built.Footnote 2Courts and commentators interpreting this\nCourt\u2019s decisions have reached this conclusion. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Polk, 546 F.\u00a03d 74, 76 (CA1\n2008) (\u201c[I]nstances of gross disproportionality [in noncapital\ncases] will be hen\u2019s-teeth rare\u201d); Barkow, The Court of Life and\nDeath: The Two Tracks of Constitutional Sentencing Law and the Case\nfor Uniformity, 107 Mich.

L. 155, 184 (2009) (\u201cEighth Amendment challenges to\nexcessive incarceration [are] essentially non-starters\u201d).Footnote 3The Court ignores entirely the threshold\ninquiry of whether subjecting juvenile offenders to adult penalties\nwas one of the \u201cmodes or acts of punishment that had been\nconsidered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights\nwas adopted.\u201dFordv.Wainwright,477 U. S. 399, 405\n(1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the evidence\nis clear that, at the time of the Founding, \u201cthe common law set a\nrebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the\nage of 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to\nbe imposed on a person as young as age 7.\u201dStanfordv.Kentucky,492 U. S. 361, 368 (1989) (citing 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries *23\u2013*24; 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown\n24\u201329 (1800)). It thus seems exceedingly unlikely that the\nimposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a person of\nGraham\u2019s age would run afoul of those standards.Footnote 4Although the details of state laws vary\nextensively, they generally permit the transfer of a juvenile\noffender to adult court through one or more of the following\nmechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the juvenile court has\nthe authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender and transfer\nthe case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in which\nadult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases and\nthe prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3)\nstatutory provisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain\ncrimes from juvenile-court jurisdiction.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (statement of\nKennedy, J., respecting denial of rehearing), juveniles who enlist\nin the military are nonetheless eligible for life-without-parole\nsentences if they commit certain nonhomicide crimes. See 10 U. S.\nC. \u00a7\u00a7505(a) (permitting enlistment at age 17), 856a, 920 (2006 ed.,\nSupp. II).Footnote 8Kennedy, 554 U.

But I would be remiss if I\ndid not mention two points about the Court\u2019s figures. First, it\nseems odd that the Court counts only those juveniles sentenced to\nlife without parole and excludes from its analysis all juveniles\nsentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (e.g., 70 or\n80 years\u2019 imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or\njury imposing such a long sentence\u2014which effectively denies the\noffender any material opportunity for parole\u2014would express moral\noutrage at a life-without-parole sentence.Second, if objective indicia of consensus were\ntruly important to the Court\u2019s analysis, the statistical\ninformation presently available would be woefully inadequate to\nform the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule that can be revoked only\nby constitutional amendment. The only evidence submitted to this\nCourt regarding the frequency of this sentence\u2019s imposition was a\nsingle study completed after this Court granted certiorari in this\ncase. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, & C. Rice, Juvenile Life\nWithout Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to\nNation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to question\nthe professionalism with which this study was conducted, the study\nitself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its\nkind. Seeid., at 1. The Court\u2019s questionable decision to\n\u201ccomplete\u201d the study on its own does not materially increase its\nreliability. For one thing, by finishing the study itself, the\nCourt prohibits the parties from ever disputing its findings.\nComplicating matters further, the original study sometimes relied\non third-party data rather than data from the States themselves,\nseeibid.;the study has never been peer reviewed; and\nspecific data on all 129 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime\nof conviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification\nof the Court\u2019s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames\nFlorida for all of this. Seeante, at 12. But as already\nnoted, it is not Florida\u2019s burden to collect data to prove a\nnational consensus in favor of this sentencing practice, but\nGraham\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove a consensusagainstit.\nSeesupra, at 16.Footnote 11I confine to a footnote the Court\u2019s\ndiscussion of foreign laws and sentencing practices because past\nopinions explain at length why such factors are irrelevant to the\nmeaning of our Constitution or the Court\u2019s discernment of any\nlongstanding tradition inthisNation. SeeAtkins, 536 U. S., at 324\u2013325 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J.,\ndissenting). Here, two points suffice. First, despite the Court\u2019s\nattempt to count the actual number of juvenile nonhomicide\noffenders serving life-without-parole sentences in other nations (a\ntask even more challenging than counting them within our borders),\nthelawsof other countries permit juvenile\nlife-without-parole sentences, see Child Rights Information,\nNetwork, C. de la Vega, M. Montesano, & A. Solter, Human Rights\nAdvocates, Statement on Juvenile Sentencing to Human Rights\nCouncil, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3, 2009) (\u201cEleven countries have laws\nwith the potential to permit the sentencing of child offenders to\nlife without the possibility of release\u201d), online at\nhttp://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as visited\nMay 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)).\nSecond, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the\nworld remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for\njuvenile offenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours\ncan count itself among the few in which judicial decree prevents\nvoters from making that choice.Footnote 12It bears noting that Colorado, one of the\nfive States that prohibit life-without-parole sentences for\njuvenile nonhomicide offenders, permits such offenders to be\nsentenced to mandatory terms of imprisonment for up to 40 years.\nColo. Rev. Stat. \u00a718\u20131.3\u2013401(4)(b) (2009). In light of the volume\nof state and federal legislation that presentlypermitslife-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\nit would be impossible to argue that there is any objective\nevidence of agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled\nto a parole hearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6\u20137 (counsel for Graham, stating that, \u201c[o]ur\nposition is that it should be left up to the States to decide. We\nthink that the \u2026 Colorado provision would probably be\nconstitutional\u201d).",
