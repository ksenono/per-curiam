For\nexample, some municipalities generally prohibit illuminated signs\nin residential neighborhoods, but lift that ban for signs that\nidentify the address of a home or the name of its owner or\noccupant. See,e.g., City of Truth or Consequences,\nN.\u00a0M., Code of Ordinances, ch. 16, Art. XIII, \u00a7\u00a711\u201313\u20132.3,\n11\u201313\u20132.9(H)(4) (2014). In other municipalities, safety signs such\nas \u201cBlind Pedestrian Crossing\u201d and \u201cHidden Driveway\u201d can be posted\nwithout a permit, even as other permanent signs require one. See,e.g., Code of Athens-Clarke County, Ga., Pt. III, \u00a77\u20134\u20137(1)\n(1993). Elsewhere, historic site markers\u2014for example, \u201cGeorge\nWashington Slept Here\u201d\u2014are also exempt from general regulations.\nSee,e.g., Dover, Del., Code of Ordinances, Pt. II, App. B,\nArt. 5, \u00a74.5(F) (2012). And simi-larly, the federal Highway\nBeautification Act limits signs along interstate highways unless,\nfor instance, they direct travelers to \u201cscenic and historical\nattractions\u201d or advertise free coffee. See 23 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7131(b),\n(c)(1), (c)(5).Given the Court\u2019s analysis, many sign ordinances\nof that kind are now in jeopardy. Seeante, at 14\n(acknowledging that \u201centirely reasonable\u201d sign laws \u201cwill sometimes\nbe struck down\u201d under its approach (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Says the majority: When laws \u201csingle[\u00a0] out\nspecific subject matter,\u201d they are \u201cfacially content based\u201d; and\nwhen they are facially content based, they are automatically\nsubject to strict scrutiny.Ante, at 12, 16\u201317. And although\nthe majority holds out hope that some sign laws with subject-matter\nexemptions \u201cmight survive\u201d that stringent review,ante, at\n17, the likelihood is that most will be struck down. After all, it\nis the \u201crare case[\u00a0] in which a speech restriction withstands\nstrict scrutiny.\u201dWilliams-Yuleev.Florida Bar, 575\nU. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 9). To clear that high bar, the\ngovernment must show that a content-based distinction \u201cis necessary\nto serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to\nachieve that end.\u201dArkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc.v.Ragland, 481 U.\u00a0S. 221, 231 (1987) . So on the\nmajority\u2019s view, courts would have to determine that a town has a\ncompelling interest in informing passersby where George Washington\nslept. And likewise, courts would have to find that a town has no\nother way to prevent hidden-driveway mishaps than by specially\ntreating hidden-driveway signs. (Well-placed speed bumps? Lower\nspeed limits? Or how about just a ban on hidden driveways?) The\nconsequence\u2014unless courts water down strict scrutiny to something\nunrecognizable\u2014is that our communities will find themselves in an\nunenviable bind: They will have to either repeal the exemptions\nthat allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks, or else lift\ntheir sign restrictions altogether and resign themselves to the\nresulting clutter.[1]*Although the majority insists that applying\nstrict scrutiny to all such ordinances is \u201cessential\u201d to protecting\nFirst Amendment freedoms,ante, at 14, I find it challenging\nto understand why that is so. This Court\u2019s decisions articulate two\nimportant and related reasons for subjecting content-based speech\nregulations to the most exacting standard of review. The first is\n\u201cto preserve an uninhib-ited marketplace of ideas in which truth\nwill ultimately prevail.\u201dMcCullenv.Coakley, 573 U.\nS. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 8\u20139) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The second is to ensure that the government has not\nregulated speech \u201cbased on hostility\u2014or favoritism\u2014towards the\nunderlying message expressed.\u201dR. A. V.v.St. Paul,\n505 U. S. 377, 386 (1992) . Yet the subject-matter exemptions\nincluded in many sign ordinances do not implicate those concerns.\nAllowing residents, say, to install a light bulb over \u201cname and\naddress\u201d signs but no others does not distort the marketplace of\nideas. Nor does that different treatment give rise to an inference\nof impermissible government motive.We apply strict scrutiny to facially\ncontent-based regulations of speech, in keeping with the rationales\njust described, when there is any \u201crealistic possibility that\nofficial suppression of ideas is afoot.\u201dDavenportv.Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U.\u00a0S. 177, 189 (2007)\n(quotingR.\u00a0A.\u00a0V., 505 U.\u00a0S., at 390). That\nis always the case when the regulation facially differentiates on\nthe basis of viewpoint. SeeRosenbergerv.Rector and\nVisitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 829 (1995) . It\nis also the case (except in non-public or limited public forums)\nwhen a law restricts \u201cdiscussion of an entire topic\u201d in public\ndebate.Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\u00a0Y.v.Public\nServ. Comm\u2019n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 530 \u2013540 (1980)\n(invalidating a limitation on speech about nuclear power). We have\nstated that \u201c[i]f the marketplace of ideas is to remain free and\nopen, governments must not be allowed to choose \u2018which issues are\nworth discussing or debating.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 537\u2013538\n(quotingPolice Dept. of Chicagov.Mosley, 408 U. S.\n92, 96 (1972) ). And we have recognized that such subject-matter\nrestrictions, even though viewpoint-neutral on their face, may\n\u201csuggest[\u00a0] an attempt to give one side of a debatable public\nquestion an advantage in expressing its views to the people.\u201dFirst Nat. Bank of Bostonv.Bellotti, 435 U.\u00a0S.\n765, 785 (1978) ; accord,ante, at 1 (Alito, J., concurring)\n(limiting all speech on one topic \u201cfavors those who do not want to\ndisturb the status quo\u201d). Subject-matter regulation, in other\nwords, may have the intent or effect of favoring some ideas over\nothers. When that is realistically possible\u2014when the restriction\n\u201craises the specter that the Government may effectively drive\ncertain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace\u201d\u2014we insist that\nthe law pass the most demanding constitutional test.R.\u00a0A.\u00a0V., 505 U.\u00a0S., at 387 (quotingSimon\n& Schuster, Inc.v.Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims\nBd., 502 U.\u00a0S. 105, 116 (1991) ).But when that is not realistically possible, we\nmay do well to relax our guard so that \u201centirely reasonable\u201d laws\nimperiled by strict scrutiny can survive.Ante, at 14. This\npoint is by no means new. Our concern with content-based regulation\narises from the fear that the government will skew the public\u2019s\ndebate of ideas\u2014so when \u201cthat risk is inconsequential,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. strict scrutiny is unwarranted.\u201dDavenport,\n551 U.\u00a0S., at 188; seeR.\u00a0A. V., 505 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 388 (approving certain content-based distinctions when there is\n\u201cno significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination\u201d). To do\nits intended work, of course, the category of content-based\nregulation triggering strict scrutiny must sweep more broadly than\nthe actual harm; that category exists to create a buffer zone\nguaranteeing that the government cannot favor or disfavor certain\nviewpoints. But that buffer zone need not extend forever. We can\nadminister our content-regulation doctrine with a dose of common\nsense, so as to leave standing laws that in no way implicate its\nintended function.And indeed we have done just that: Our cases\nhave been far less rigid than the majority admits in applying\nstrict scrutiny to facially content-based laws\u2014including in cases\njust like this one. SeeDavenport, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 188\n(noting that \u201cwe have identified numerous situations in which [the]\nrisk\u201d attached to content-based laws is \u201cattenuated\u201d). InMembers of City Council of Los Angelesv.Taxpayers for\nVincent, 466 U.\u00a0S. 789 (1984) , the Court declined to\napply strict scrutiny to a municipal ordinance that exempted\naddress numbers and markers commemorating \u201chistorical, cultural, or\nartistic event[s]\u201d from a generally applicable limit on sidewalk\nsigns.Id., at 792, n.\u00a01 (listing exemptions); seeid., at 804\u2013810 (upholding ordinance under intermediate\nscrutiny). After all, we explained, the law\u2019s enactment and\nenforcement revealed \u201cnot even a hint of bias or censorship.\u201dId., at 804; see alsoRentonv.Playtime Theatres,\nInc., 475 U.\u00a0S. 41, 48 (1986) (applying intermediate\nscrutiny to a zoning law that facially distinguished among movie\ntheaters based on content because it was \u201cdesigned to prevent\ncrime, protect the city\u2019s retail trade, [and] maintain property\nvalues .\u00a0.\u00a0. , not to suppress the expression of\nunpopular views\u201d). And another decision involving a similar law\nprovides an alternative model. InCity of Laduev.Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43 (1994) , the Court assumedarguendothat a sign ordinance\u2019s exceptions for address\nsigns, safety signs, and for-sale signs in residential areas did\nnot trigger strict scrutiny. Seeid., at 46\u201347, and\nn.\u00a06 (listing exemptions);id., at 53 (noting this\nassumption). We did not need to, and so did not, decide the\nlevel-of-scrutiny question because the law\u2019s breadth made it\nunconstitutional under any standard.The majority could easily have takenLadue\u2019s tack here. The Town of Gilbert\u2019s defense of its sign\nordinance\u2014most notably, the law\u2019s distinctions between directional\nsigns and others\u2014does not pass strict scrutiny, or intermediate\nscrutiny, or even the laugh test. Seeante, at 14\u201315\n(discussing those distinctions). The Town, for example, provides no\nreason at all for prohibiting more than four directional signs on a\nproperty while placing no limits on the number of other types of\nsigns. See Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. I,\n\u00a7\u00a74.402(J), (P)(2) (2014). Similarly, the Town offers no coherent\njustification for restricting the size of directional signs to 6\nsquare feet while allowing other signs to reach 20 square feet. See\n\u00a7\u00a74.402(J), (P)(1). The best the Town could come up with at oral\nargument was that directional signs \u201cneed to be smaller because\nthey need to guide travelers along a route.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.\nWhy exactly a smaller sign better helps travelers get to where they\nare going is left a mystery. The absence of any sensible basis for\nthese and other distinctions dooms the Town\u2019s ordinance under even\nthe intermediate scrutiny that the Court typically applies to\n\u201ctime, place, or manner\u201d speech regulations. Accordingly, there is\nno need to decide in this case whether strict scrutiny applies to\nevery sign ordinance in every town across this country containing a\nsubject-matter exemption.I suspect this Court and others will regret the\nmajority\u2019s insistence today on answering that question in the\naffirmative. As the years go by, courts will discover that\nthousands of towns have such ordinances, many of them \u201centirely\nreasonable.\u201dAnte, at 14. And as the challenges to them\nmount, courts will have to invalidate one after the other. (This\nCourt may soon find itself a veritable Supreme Board of Sign\nReview.) And courts will strike down those democratically enacted\nlocal laws even though no one\u2014certainly not the majority\u2014has ever\nexplained why the vindication of First Amendment values requires\nthat result. Because I see no reason why such an easy case calls\nfor us to cast a constitutional pall on reasonable regulations\nquite unlike the law before us, I concur only in the judgment.Notes1*\u00a0Even in trying\n(commendably) to limit today\u2019s decision, Justice Alito\u2019s\nconcurrence highlights its far-reaching effects. According to\nJustice Alito, the majority does not subject to strict scrutiny\nregulations of \u201csigns advertising a one-time event.\u201dAnte,\nat 2 (Alito, J., concurring). But of course it does. On the\nmajority\u2019s view, a law with an exception for such signs \u201csingles\nout specific subject matter for differential treatment\u201d and\n\u201cdefin[es] regulated speech by particular subject matter.\u201dAnte, at 6, 12 (majority opinion). Indeed, the precise\nreason the majority applies strict scrutiny here is that \u201cthe Code\nsingles out signs bearing a particular message: the time and\nlocation of a specific event.\u201dAnte, at 14.",
