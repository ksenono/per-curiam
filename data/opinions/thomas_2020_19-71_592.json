We\nhold that it does.IARFRA secures Congress\u2019 view of the right to\nfree exercise under the First Amendment, and it provides a remedy\nto redress violations of that right. Congress passed the Act in the\nwake of this Court\u2019s decision inEmployment Div., Dept. of Human\nResources of Ore.v.Smith,494\nU.S. 872, 885\u2013890 (1990), which held that the First Amendment\ntolerates neutral, generally applicable laws that burden or\nprohibit religious acts even when the laws are unsupported by a\nnarrowly tailored, compelling governmental interest. See\n\u00a72000bb(a). RFRA sought to counter the effect of that holding and\nrestore the pre-Smith\u201ccompelling interest test\u201d by\n\u201cprovid[ing] a claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. to persons whose religious\nexercise is substantially burdened by government.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a72000bb(b)(1)\u2013(2). That right of action enables a person to\n\u201cobtain appropriate relief against a government.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(c). A\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018government\u2019\u00a0\u201d is defined to include \u201ca branch,\ndepartment, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person\nacting under color of law) of the United States.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20132(1).BRespondents Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibhah,\nand Naveed Shinwari are practicing Muslims who claim that Federal\nBureau of Investigation agents placed them on the No Fly List in\nretaliation for their refusal to act as informants against their\nreligious communities. Respondents sued various agents in their\nofficial capacities, seeking removal from the No Fly List. They\nalso sued the agents in their individual capacities for money\ndamages. According to respondents, the retaliation cost them\nsubstantial sums of money: airline tickets wasted and income from\njob opportunities lost.More than a year after respondents sued, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security informed them that they could now\nfly, thus mooting the claims for injunctive relief. The District\nCourt then dismissed the individual-capacity claims for money\ndamages, ruling that RFRA does not permit monetary relief.The Second Circuit reversed. 894 F.3d 449\n(2018). It determined that RFRA\u2019s express remedies provision,\ncombined with the statutory definition of \u201cGovernment,\u201d authorizes\nclaims against federal officials in their individual capacities.\nRelying on our precedent and RFRA\u2019s broad protections for religious\nliberty, the court concluded that the open-ended phrase\n\u201cappropriate relief\u00a0\u201d encompasses money damages against\nofficials. We granted certiorari, 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), and\nnow affirm.IIAs usual, we start with the statutory text.E.g.,Mission Product Holdings, Inc.v.Tempnology, LLC, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op.,\nat 8). A person whose exercise of religion has been unlawfully\nburdened may \u201cobtain appropriate relief against a government.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb\u20131(c).AWe first have to determine if injured parties\ncan sue Government officials in their personal capacities. RFRA\u2019s\ntext provides a clear answer: They can. Persons may sue and obtain\nrelief \u201cagainst a government,\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20131(c), which is defined to\ninclude \u201ca branch, department, agency, instrumentality, andofficial(or other person acting under color of law)\nof the United States.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20132(1) (emphasis added).The Government urges us to limit lawsuits\nagainst officials to suits against them in their official, not\npersonal, capacities. A lawsuit seeking damages from employees in\ntheir individual capacities, the Government argues, is not really\n\u201cagainst a government\u201d because relief \u201ccan be executed only against\nthe official\u2019s personal assets.\u201dKentuckyv.Graham,473 U.S.\n159, 166 (1985).The problem with this otherwise plausible\nargument is that Congress supplanted the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cgovernment\u201d with a different, express definition. \u201c\u00a0\u2018When a\nstatute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that\ndefinition,\u2019 even if it varies from a term\u2019s ordinary meaning.\u201dDigital Realty Trust, Inc.v.Somers, 583 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (slip op., at 9) (quotingBurgessv.United\nStates,553 U.S.\n124, 130 (2008)). For example, if a statute defines a \u201cState\u201d\nto include territories and districts, that addition to the plain\nmeaning controls. See,e.g.,15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7267. So\ntoo here. A \u201cgovernment,\u201d under RFRA, extends beyond the term\u2019s\nplain meaning to include officials. And the term \u201cofficial\u201d does\nnot refer solely to an office, but rather to the actual person \u201cwho\nis invested with an office.\u201d 10 Oxford English Dictionary 733 (2d\ned. 1989). Under RFRA\u2019s definition, relief that can be executed\nagainst an \u201cofficial .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the United States\u201dis\u201crelief against a government.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a72000bb\u20131(c), 2000bb\u20132(1).Not only does the term \u201cgovernment\u201d encompass\nofficials, it also authorizes suits against \u201cother person[s] acting\nunder color of law.\u201d \u00a72000bb\u20132(1). The right to obtain relief\nagainst \u201ca person\u201d cannot be squared with the Government\u2019s reading\nthat relief must always run against the United States.\nMoreover,the use of the phrase \u201cofficial (orotherperson .\u00a0.\u00a0. )\u201d underscores that\n\u201cofficial[s]\u201d are treated like \u201cperson[s].\u201dIbid.(emphasis\nadded). In other words, the parenthetical clarifies that \u201ca\ngovernment\u201d includes both individuals who are officials acting\nunder color of lawandother, additional individuals who are\nnonofficials acting under color of law. Here, respondents sued the\nformer.The legal \u201cbackdrop against which Congress\nenacted\u201d RFRA confirms the propriety of individual-capacity suits.Stewartv.Dutra Constr. Co.,543\nU.S. 481, 487 (2005). The phrase \u201cpersons acting under color of\nlaw\u201d draws on one of the most well-known civil rights statutes: 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983. That statute applies to \u201cperson[s]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. under color of any statute,\u201d and this Court has\nlong interpreted it to permit suits against officials in their\nindividual capacities. See,e.g.,Memphis Community\nSchool Dist.v.Stachura,477 U.S.\n299, 305\u2013306, and n. 8 (1986). Because RFRA uses the same\nterminology as \u00a71983 in the very same field of civil rights law,\n\u201cit is reasonable to believe that the terminology bears a\nconsistent meaning.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 323 (2012). A suit against an\nofficial in his personal capacity is a suit against a person acting\nunder color of law. And a suit against a person acting under color\nof law is a suit against \u201ca government,\u201d as defined under RFRA.\n\u00a72000bb\u20131(c).BThe question then becomes what \u201cappropriate\nrelief\u00a0\u201d entails. Without a statutory definition, we turn to\nthe phrase\u2019s plain meaning at the time of enactment. SeeFCCv.AT&T Inc.,562 U.S.\n397, 403 (2011). \u201cAppropriate\u201d means \u201c[s]pecially fitted or\nsuitable, proper.\u201d 1 Oxford English Dictionary, at 586; see also\nMerriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 57 (10th ed. 1996)\n(\u201cespecially suitable or compatible\u201d). Because this language is\n\u201copen-ended\u201d on its face, what relief is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018appropriate\u2019\u00a0\u201d is \u201cinherently context dependent.\u201dSossamonv.Texas,563 U.S.\n277, 286 (2011) (interpreting identical language).In the context of suits against Government\nofficials, damages have long been awarded as appropriate relief. In\nthe early Republic, \u201can array of writs .\u00a0.\u00a0. allowed\nindividuals to test the legality of government conduct by filing\nsuit against government officials\u201d for money damages \u201cpayable by\nthe officer.\u201d Pfander & Hunt, Public Wrongs and Private Bills:\nIndemnification and Govt Accountability in the Early Republic, 85\nN.\u00a0Y.\u00a0U.\u00a0L. Rev. 1862, 1871\u20131875 (2010); seeid., at 1875, n. 52 (collecting cases). These common-law\ncauses of action remained available through the 19th century and\ninto the 20th. See,e.g.,Littlev.Barreme, 2\nCranch 170 (1804);Elliottv.Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137\n(1836);Mitchellv.Harmony, 13 How. 115 (1852);Buckv.Colbath, 3 Wall. 334 (1866);Belknapv.Schild,161 U.S.\n10(1896);PhiladelphiaCo. v.Stimson,223 U.S.\n605, 619\u2013620 (1912) (\u201cThe exemption of the United States from\nsuit does not protect its officers from personal liability to\npersons whose rights of property they have wrongfully\ninvaded\u201d).Though more limited, damages against federal\nofficials remain an appropriate form of relief today. In 1988 the\nWestfall Act foreclosed common-law claims for damages against\nfederal officials, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679, but it left open\nclaims for constitutional violations and certain statutory\nviolations. \u00a7\u00a72679(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B). Indeed, the Act expressly\ncontemplates that a statute could authorize an action for damages\nagainst Government employees. \u00a72679(b)(2)(B) (explaining that the\ndisplacement of remedies \u201cdoes not extend or apply to a civil\naction against an employee of the Government .\u00a0.\u00a0. which\nis brought for a violation of a statute of the United States under\nwhich such action against an individual is otherwise\nauthorized\u201d).Damages are also commonly available against\nstate and local government officials. In 1871, for example,\nCongress passed the precursor to \u00a71983, imposing liability on any\nperson who, under color of state law, deprived another of a\nconstitutional right. 17Stat. 13; see alsoMyersv.Anderson,238 U.S.\n368, 379, 383 (1915) (affirming award of damages against state\nelection officials). By the time Congress enacted RFRA, this Court\nhad interpreted the modern version of \u00a71983 to permit monetary\nrecovery against officials who violated \u201cclearly established\u201d\nfederal law.E.g.,Procunierv.Navarette,434 U.S.\n555, 561\u2013562 (1978);Siegertv.Gilley,500 U.S.\n226, 231 (1991).This availability of damages under \u00a71983 is\nparticularly salient in light of RFRA\u2019s origins. When first\nenacted, RFRA defined \u201c\u00a0\u2018government\u2019\u00a0\u201d to include an\n\u201cofficial (or other person acting under color of law) of the United\nStates,a State, or a subdivision of a State.\u201d 107Stat. 1489\n(emphasis added). It made no distinction between state and federal\nofficials. After this Court held that RFRA could not be enforced\nagainst the States, seeCity of Boernev.Flores,521 U.S.\n507, 511 (1997), Congress narrowly amended the definition \u201cby\nstriking \u2018a State, or a subdivision of a State.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 114Stat.\n806. That context is important because RFRA made clear that it was\nreinstating both the pre-Smithsubstantive protections of\nthe First Amendmentandthe right to vindicate those\nprotections by a claim. \u00a72000bb(b). There is no doubt that damages\nclaims have always been available under \u00a71983 for clearly\nestablished violations of the First Amendment. See,e.g.,Sausev.Bauer, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018)\n(per\u00a0curiam) (reversing grant of qualified immunity in\na case seeking damages under \u00a71983 based on alleged violations of\nfree exercise rights and Fourth Amendment rights);Murphyv.Missouri Dept. of Corrections, 814 F.2d 1252, 1259 (CA8\n1987) (remanding to enter judgment for plaintiffs on a \u00a71983 free\nspeech and free exercise claims and to determine and order\n\u201cappropriate relief, which .\u00a0.\u00a0. may, if appropriate,\ninclude an award\u201d of damages). Given that RFRA reinstated\npre-Smithprotections and rights, parties suing under RFRA\nmust have at least the same avenues for relief against officials\nthat they would have had beforeSmith. That means RFRA\nprovides, as one avenue for relief, a right to seek damages against\nGovernment employees.A damages remedy is not just \u201cappropriate\u201d\nrelief as viewed through the lens of suits against Government\nemployees. It is also theonlyform of relief that can\nremedy some RFRA violations. For certain injuries, such as\nrespondents\u2019 wasted plane tickets, effective relief consists of\ndamages, not an injunction. See,e.g.,DeMarcov.Davis, 914 F.3d 383, 390 (CA5 2019) (destruction of\nreligious property);Yangv.Sturner,728 F. Supp. 845(RI 1990), opinion withdrawn750 F. Supp. 558(RI 1990) (autopsy of son that violated Hmong\nbeliefs). Given the textual cues just noted, it would be odd to\nconstrue RFRA in a manner that prevents courts from awarding such\nrelief. Had Congress wished to limit the remedy to that degree, it\nknew how to do so. See,e.g., 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71132(a)(3) (providing for \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u00a0\u201d);\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20135(g)(1) (providing for \u201cequitable\nrelief as the court deems appropriate\u201d); 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a778u(d)(5) (providing for \u201cany equitable relief that may be\nappropriate or necessary\u201d).[1]*Our opinion inSossamondoes not change\nthis analysis.Sossamonheld that a State\u2019s acceptance of\nfederal funding did not waive sovereign immunity to suits for\ndamages under a related statute\u2014the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000\u2014which also permits\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018appropriate relief.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 563 U.\u00a0S., at 280, 282.\nThe obvious difference is that this case features a suit against\nindividuals, who do not enjoy sovereign immunity.The Government also posits that we should be\nwary of damages against government officials because these awards\ncould raise separation-of-powers concerns. But this exact remedy\nhas coexisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the\nRepublic. To be sure, there may be policy reasons why Congress may\nwish to shield Government employees from personal liability, and\nCongress is free to do so. But there are no constitutional reasons\nwhy we must do so in its stead.To the extent the Government asks us to create a\nnew policy-based presumption against damages against individual\nofficials, we are not at liberty to do so. Congress is best suited\nto create such a policy. Our task is simply to interpret the law as\nan ordinary person would. Although background presumptions can\ninform the understanding of a word or phrase, those presumptions\nmust exist at the time of enactment. We cannot manufacture a new\npresumption now and retroactively impose it on a Congress that\nacted 27 years ago.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We conclude that RFRA\u2019s express remedies\nprovision permits litigants, when appropriate, to obtain money\ndamages against federal officials in their individual capacities.\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Justice Barrett took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1*\u00a0Both the Government and\nrespondents agree that government officials are entitled to assert\na qualified immunity defense when sued in their individual\ncapacities for money damages under RFRA. Indeed, respondents\nemphasize that the \u201cqualified immunity defense was created for\nprecisely these circumstances,\u201d Brief for Respondents 22, and is a\n\u201cpowerful shield\u201d that \u201cprotects all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who flout clearly established law,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 42; seeDistrict of Columbiav.Wesby, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 13\u201315).",
