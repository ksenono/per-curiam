Section\n271(f)(1) of the Patent Act of 1952 prohibits the supply from\ntheUnited States of \u201call or a substantial portion\u201d of the\ncomponents of a patented invention for combination abroad. 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1). We granted certiorari to determine\nwhether a party that supplies a single component of a\nmulticomponent invention for manufacture abroad can be held liable\nfor infringement under \u00a7271(f)(1). 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016). We\nhold that a single component does not constitute a substantial\nportion of the components that can give rise to liability under\n\u00a7271(f)(1). Because only a single component of the patented\ninvention at issue here was supplied from the United States, we\nreverse and remand.IAWe begin with an overview of the patent in\ndispute. Although the science behind the patent is complex, a basic\nunderstanding suffices to resolve the question presented by this\ncase.The Tautz patent, U.\u00a0S. Reissue Patent No.\nRE 37,984, claims a toolkit for genetic testing.[1] The kit is used to take small samples of\ngenetic material\u2014in the form of nucleotide sequences that make up\nthe molecule deoxyribonu-cleic acid (commonly referred to as\n\u201cDNA\u201d)\u2014and then synthesize multiple copies of a particular\nnucleotide sequence. This process of copying, known as\namplification, generates DNA profiles that can be used by law\nenforcement agencies for forensic identification and by clinical\nand research institutions around the world. For purposes of this\nlitigation, the parties agree that the kit covered by the Tautz\npatent contains five components: (1) a mixture of primers that mark\nthe part of the DNA strand to be copied; (2) nucleotides for\nforming replicated strands of DNA; (3) an enzyme known asTaqpolymerase; (4) a buffer solution for the amplification;\nand (5) control DNA.[2]Respondent Promega Corporation was the exclusive\nlicensee of the Tautz patent. Petitioner Life Technologies\nCorporation manufactured genetic testing kits.[3] During the timeframe relevant here, Promega\nsublicensed the Tautz patent to Life Technologies for the\nmanufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law\nenforcement fields worldwide. Life Technologies manufactured all\nbut one component of the kits in the United Kingdom. It\nmanufactured that component\u2014theTaqpolymerase\u2014in the United\nStates. Life Technologies shipped theTaqpolymerase to its\nUnited Kingdom facility, where it was combined with the other four\ncomponents of the kit.Four years into the agreement, Promega sued Life\nTechnologies on the grounds that Life Technologies had infringed\nthe patent by selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use\nto clinical and research markets. As relevant here, Promega alleged\nthat Life Technologies\u2019 supply of theTaqpolymerase from\nthe United States to its United Kingdom manufacturing facilities\ntriggered liability under \u00a7271(f)(1).BAt trial, the parties disputed the scope of\n\u00a7271(f)(1)\u2019s prohibition against supplying all or a substantial\nportion of the components of a patented invention from the United\nStates for combination abroad. Section 271(f)(1)\u2019s full text\nreads:\u201cWhoever without authority supplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States all or a\nsubstantial portion of the components of a patented invention,\nwhere such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such\nmanner as to actively induce the combination of such components\noutside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the\npatent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall\nbe liable as an infringer.\u201dThe jury returned a verdict for Promega, finding\nthat Life Technologies had willfully infringed the patent. Life\nTechnologies then moved for judgment as a matter of law, contending\nthat \u00a7271(f)(1) did not apply to its conduct because the phrase\n\u201call or a substantial portion\u201d does not encompass the supply of a\nsingle component of a multicomponent invention.The District Court granted Life Technologies\u2019\nmotion. The court agreed that there could be no infringement under\n\u00a7271(f)(1) because Promega\u2019s evidence at trial \u201cshowed at most thatonecomponent of all of the accused products, [theTaq] polymerase, was supplied from the United States.\u201d 2012\nWL 12862829, *3 (WD Wis., Sept. 13, 2012) (Crabb, J.). Section\n271(f)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201ca substantial portion of the components,\u201d\nthe District Court ruled, does not embrace the supply of a single\ncomponent.Id.,at *5.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\nreversed and reinstated the jury\u2019s verdict finding Life\nTechnologies liable for infringement.[4] 773 F.\u00a03d 1338, 1353 (2014). As relevant here, the\ncourt held that \u201cthere are circumstances in which a party may be\nliable under \u00a7271(f)(1) for supplying or causing to be supplied a\nsingle component for combination outside the United States.\u201dIbid.The Federal Circuit concluded that the dictionary\ndefinition of \u201csubstantial\u201d is \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cessential,\u201d which it\nread to suggest that a single important component can be a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018substantial portion of the components\u2019\u00a0\u201d of a patented\ninvention.Ibid. Relying in part on expert trial testimony\nthat theTaqpolymerase is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018main\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018major\u2019\u00a0\u201d component of the kits, the court ruled that\nthe singleTaqpolymerase component was a substantial\ncomponent as the term is used in \u00a7271(f)(1).Id., at\n1356.IIThe question before us is whether the supply\nof a single component of a multicomponent invention is an\ninfringing act under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1). We hold that\nit is not.AThe threshold determination to be made is\nwhether \u00a7271(f)(2)\u2019s requirement of \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of the\ncomponents of a patented invention refers to a quantitative or\nqualitative measurement. Life Technologies and the United States\nargue that the text of \u00a7271(f)(1) establishes a quantitative\nthreshold, and that the threshold must be greater than one. Promega\ndefends the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute, arguing that\na \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the components includes a single\ncomponent if that component is sufficiently important to the\ninvention.We look first to the text of the statute.Sebeliusv.Cloer, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 6). The Patent Act itself does not define the term\n\u201csubstantial,\u201d and so we turn to its ordinary meaning.Ibid.Here we find little help. All agree the term is ambiguous and,\ntaken in isolation, might refer to an important portion or to a\nlarge portion. Brief for Petitioners 16; Brief for Respondent 18;\nBrief for United States asAmicus Curiae12. \u201cSubstantial,\u201d\nas it is commonly understood, may refer either to qualitative\nimportance or to quantitatively large size. See,e.g.,Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2280 (defs. 1c, 2c)\n(1981) (Webster\u2019s Third) (\u201cimportant, essential,\u201d or \u201cconsiderable\nin amount, value, or worth\u201d); 17 Oxford English Dictionary 67\n(defs. 5a, 9) (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\u201cThat is, constitutes, or\ninvolves an essential part, point, or feature; essential,\nmaterial,\u201d or \u201cOf ample or considerable amount, quantity, or\ndimensions\u201d).The context in which \u201csubstantial\u201d appears in\nthe statute, however, points to a quantitative meaning here. Its\nneighboring terms are the first clue. \u201c[A] word is given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated.\u201dUnited Statesv.Williams, 553\nU.\u00a0S. 285, 294 (2008) . Both \u201call\u201d and \u201cportion\u201d convey a\nquantitative meaning. \u201cAll\u201d means the entire quantity, without\nreference to relative importance. See,e.g.,Webster\u2019s Third\n54 (defs. 1a, 2a, 3) (\u201cthat is the whole amount or quantity of,\u201d or\n\u201cevery member or individual component of,\u201d or \u201cthe whole number or\nsum of\u201d); 1 OED 324 (def. 2) (\u201cThe entire number of; the individual\ncomponents of, without exception\u201d). \u201cPortion\u201d likewise refers to\nsome quantity less than all. Webster\u2019s Third 1768 (defs. 1, 3a)\n(\u201can individual\u2019s part or share of something,\u201d or \u201ca part of a\nwhole\u201d); 12 OED 154, 155 (def. 1a, 5a) (\u201cThe part (of anything)\nallotted or belonging to one person,\u201d or \u201cA part of any whole\u201d).\nConversely, there is nothing in the neighboring text to ground a\nqualitative interpretation.Moreover, the phrase \u201csubstantial portion\u201d is\nmodified by \u201cof the components of a patented invention.\u201d It is the\nsupply of all or a substantial portion \u201cof the components\u201d of a\npatented invention that triggers liability for infringement. But if\n\u201csubstantial\u201d has a qualitative meaning, then the more natural way\nto write the opening clause of the provision would be to not\nreference \u201cthe components\u201d at all. Instead, the opening clause of\n\u00a7271(f)(1) could have triggered liability for the supply of \u201call or\na substantial portion of .\u00a0.\u00a0. a patented invention,\nwhere [its] components are uncombined in whole or in part.\u201d A\nqualitative reading would render the phrase \u201cof the components\u201d\nunnecessary the first time it is used in \u00a7271(f)(1). Whenever\npossible, however, we should favor an interpretation that gives\nmeaning to each statutory provision. SeeHibbsv.Winn, 542 U.\u00a0S. 88, 101 (2004) . Only the quantitative\napproach does so here. Thus, \u201csubstantial,\u201d in the context of\n\u00a7271(f)(1), is most reasonably read to connote a quantitative\nmeasure.Promega argues that a quantitative approach is\ntoo narrow, and invites the Court to instead adopt a \u201ccase-specific\napproach\u201d that would require a factfinder to decipher whether the\ncomponents at issue are a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d undereithera qualitative or quantitative test. Brief for Respondent 17, 42. We\ndecline to do so. Having determined the phrase \u201csubstantial\nportion\u201d is ambiguous, our task is to resolve that ambiguity, not\nto compound it by tasking juries across the Nation with\ninterpreting the meaning of the statute on an ad\u00a0hoc basis.\nSee,e.g.,Robinsonv.Shell Oil Co., 519\nU.\u00a0S. 337 \u2013346 (1997).As a more general matter, moreover, we cannot\naccept Promega\u2019s suggestion that the Court adopt a different\nanalytical framework entirely\u2014one that accounts for both the\nquantitativeandqualitative aspects of the components.\nPromega reads \u00a7271(f)(1) to mean that the answer to whether a given\nportion of the components is \u201csubstantial\u201d depends not only on the\nnumber of components involved but also on their qualitative\nimportance to the invention overall. At first blush, there is some\nappeal to the idea that, in close cases, a subjective analysis of\nthe qualitative importance of a component may help determine\nwhether it is a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the components of a\npatent. But, for the reasons discussed above, the statute\u2019s\nstructure provides little support for a qualitative interpretation\nof the term.[5]Nor would considering the qualitative importance\nof a component necessarily help resolve close cases. To the\ncontrary, it might just as easily complicate the factfinder\u2019s\nreview. Surely a great many components of an invention (if not\nevery component) are important. Few inventions, including the one\nat issue here, would function at all without any one of their\ncomponents. Indeed, Promega has not identified any component\ncovered by the Tautz patent that would not satisfy Promega\u2019s\n\u201cimportance\u201d litmus test.[6]\nHow are courts\u2014or, for that matter, market participants attempting\nto avoid liability\u2014to determine the relative importance of the\ncomponents of an invention? Neither Promega nor the Federal Circuit\noffers an easy way to make this decision. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat a quantitative interpretation hews most closely to the text of\nthe statute and provides an administrable construction.BHaving determined that the term \u201csubstantial\nportion\u201d refers to a quantitative measurement, we must next decide\nwhether, as a matter of law, a single component can ever constitute\na \u201csubstantial portion\u201d so as to trigger liability under\n\u00a7271(f)(1). The answer is no.As before, we begin with the text of the\nstatute. Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to \u201ccomponents\u201d in\nthe plural. The section is targeted toward the supply of all or a\nsubstantial portion \u201cof thecomponents,\u201d where \u201csuchcomponents\u201d are uncombined, in a manner that actively\ninduces the combination of \u201csuchcomponents\u201d outside the\nUnited States. Text specifying a substantial portion of\n\u201ccomponents,\u201d plural, indicates that multiple components constitute\nthe substantial portion.The structure of \u00a7271(f) reinforces this\nreading. Section 271(f)(2), which is \u00a7271(f)(1)\u2019s companion\nprovision, reads as follows:\u201cWhoever without authority supplies or\ncauses to be supplied in or from the United States any component of\na patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted\nfor use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of\ncommerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such\ncomponent is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such\ncomponent is so made or adapted and intending that such component\nwill be combined outside of theUnited States in a manner that would\ninfringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United\nStates, shall be liable as an infringer.\u201dReading \u00a7271(f)(1) to refer to more than one\ncomponent allows the two provisions to work in tandem. Whereas\n\u00a7271(f)(1) refers to \u201ccomponents,\u201d plural, \u00a7271(f)(2) refers to\n\u201cany component,\u201d singular. And, whereas \u00a7271(f)(1) speaks to\nwhether the components supplied by a party constitute a substantial\nportion of the components,\u00a7271(f)(2) speaks to whether a party has\nsupplied \u201cany\u201d noncommodity component \u201cespecially made or\nespecially adapted for use in the invention.\u201dWe do not disagree with the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nobservation that the two provisions concern different scenarios.\nSee 773 F.\u00a03d, at 1354. As this Court has previously observed,\n\u00a7\u00a7271(f)(1) and 271(f)(2) \u201cdiffer, among other things, on the\nquantity of components that must be \u2018supplie[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfrom the United States\u2019 for liability to attach.\u201dMicrosoft\nCorp.v.AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S. 437, 454, n. 16\n(2007) . But we do not draw the Federal Circuit\u2019s conclusion from\nthese different but related provisions. Reading \u00a7271(f)(1) to coveranysingle component would not only leave little room for\n\u00a7271(f)(2), but would also undermine \u00a7271(f)(2)\u2019s express reference\nto a single component \u201cespecially made or especially adapted for\nuse in the invention.\u201d[7] Our\nconclusion that \u00a7271(f)(1) prohibits the supply of components,\nplural, gives each subsection its unique application.[8] See,e.g.,Cloer, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,at 6).Taken alone, \u00a7271(f)(1)\u2019s reference to\n\u201ccomponents\u201d might plausibly be read to encompass \u201ccomponent\u201d in\nthe singular. See 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 (instructing that \u201cwords\nimporting the plural include the singular,\u201d \u201cunless the context\nindicates otherwise\u201d). But \u00a7271(f)\u2019s text, context, and structure\nleave us to conclude that when Congress said \u201ccomponents,\u201d plural,\nit meant plural, and when it said \u201ccomponent,\u201d singular, it meant\nsingular.We do not today define how close to \u201call\u201d of the\ncomponents \u201ca substantial portion\u201d must be. We hold only that one\ncomponent does not constitute \u201call or a substantial portion\u201d of a\nmulticomponent invention under \u00a7271(f)(1). This is all that is\nrequired to resolve the question presented.CThe history of \u00a7271(f) bolsters our\nconclusion. The Court has previously observed that Congress enacted\n\u00a7271(f) in response to our decision inDeepsouth Packing Co.v.Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518 (1972) . SeeMicrosoft Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S., at 444. InDeepsouth, the Court determined that, under patent law as it\nexisted at the time, it was \u201cnot an infringement to make or use a\npatented product outside of the United States.\u201d 406 U.\u00a0S., at\n527. The new \u00a7271(f) \u201cexpand[ed] the definition of infringement to\ninclude supplying from the United States a patented invention\u2019s\ncomponents,\u201d as outlined in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2).Microsoft, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 444\u2013445.The effect of this provision was to fill a gap\nin the enforceability of patent rights by reaching components that\nare manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas and\nthat were beyond the reach of the statute in its prior formulation.\nOur ruling today comports with Congress\u2019 intent. A supplier may be\nliable under\u00a7271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or\na substantial portion of the components (plural) of the invention,\neven when those components are combined abroad. The same is true\neven for a single component under \u00a7271(f)(2) if it is especially\nmade or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a\nstaple article or commodity. We are persuaded, however, that when\nas in this case a product is made abroad and all components but a\nsingle commodity article are supplied from abroad, this activity is\noutside the scope of the statute.IIIWe hold that the phrase \u201csubstantial portion\u201d\nin 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1) has a quantitative, not a\nqualitative, meaning. We hold further that \u00a7271(f)(1) does not\ncover the supply of a single component of a multicomponent\ninvention. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.The Chief Justice took no part in the decision\nof this case.Notes1The Tautz patent expired\nin 2015. The litigation thus concerns past acts of infringement\nonly.2Because the parties here\nagree that the patented invention is made up of only these five\ncomponents, we do not consider how to identify the \u201ccomponents\u201d of\na patent or whether and how that inquiry relates to the elements of\na patent claim.3Applied Biosystems, LLC,\nand Invitrogen IP Holdings, Inc., are also petitioners in this\nproceeding and are wholly owned subsidiaries of Life Technologies\nCorporation. The agreement at issue here was originally between\nPromega and Applied Biosystems.773 F.\u00a03d 1338, 1344,\nn. 3 (CA Fed. 2014).4Chief Judge Prost\ndissented from the majority\u2019s conclusion with respect to the\n\u201cactive inducement\u201d element of 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1). 773 F.\u00a03d, at 1358\u20131360. Neither that\nquestion, nor any of the Federal Circuit\u2019s conclusions regarding\nLife Technologies\u2019 liability under \u00a7271(a) or infringement of four\nadditional Promega patents, seeid., at 1341, is before us.\nSee 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).5The examples Promega\nprovides of other statutes\u2019 use of the terms \u201csubstantial\u201d or\n\u201csignificant\u201d are inapposite. See Brief for Respondent 19\u201320. The\ntext of these statutes, which arise in different statutory schemes\nwith diverse purposes and structures, differs in material ways from\nthe text of \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1). The Tax Code, for instance, refers to\n\u201ca substantial portion of a return,\u201d 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a77701(a)(36)(A), not to \u201ca substantial portionof the\nentriesof a return.\u201d6Life Technologies\u2019 expert\ndescribed theTaqpolymerase as a \u201cmain\u201d component. App.\n160. The expert also described two other components the same way.Ibid.7This Court\u2019s opinion inMicrosoft Corp.v.AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S.\n437, 447 (2007) , is not to the contrary. The holding in that case\nturned not on the number of components involved, but rather on\nwhether the software at issue was a component at all.8Promega argues that the\nimportant distinction between these provisions is that\n\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1), unlike \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2), requires a showing of\nspecific intent for active inducement. Brief for Respondent 34\u201341.\nBut cf.Global-Tech Appliances, Inc.v.SEB\nS.\u00a0A., 563 U.\u00a0S. 754 \u2013766 (2011) (substantially\nequating the intent requirements for \u00a7\u00a7271(b) and 271(c), on which\nPromega asserts \u00a7\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1) and (f\u00a0)(2) were modeled).\nBut, to repeat, whatever intent subsection (f\u00a0)(1) may\nrequire, it also imposes liability only on a party who supplies a\n\u201csubstantial portion of the components\u201d of the invention. Thus,\neven assuming that subsection (f\u00a0)(1)\u2019s \u201cactive inducement\u201d\nrequirement is different from subsection (f\u00a0)(2)\u2019s \u201cknowing\u201d\nand \u201cintending\u201d element\u2014a question we do not reach today\u2014that\ndifference between the two provisions does not read the\n\u201csubstantial portion\u201d language out of the statute.",
