STERN, executor of the ESTATE OF VICKIE\nLYNN MARSHALL, PETITIONERv.ELAINE T. MARSHALL, executrix\nof the ESTATE OF E. PIERCE MARSHALLon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[June 23, 2011]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.This \u201csuit has, in course of\ntime, become so complicated, that \u2026 no two \u2026 lawyers can talk about\nit for five minutes, without coming to a total disagreement as to\nall the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the\ncause: innumerable young people have married into it;\u201d and, sadly,\nthe original parties \u201chave died out of it.\u201d A \u201clong procession of\n[judges] has come in and gone out\u201d dur-ing that time, and still the\nsuit \u201cdrags its weary length before the Court.\u201dThose words were not written about this case,\nsee C.\u00a0Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens 4\u20135\n(1891), but they could have been. This is the second time we have\nhad occasion to weigh in on this long-running dispute between\nVickie Lynn Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall over the fortune of J.\nHoward Marshall II, a man believed to have been one of the richest\npeople in Texas. The Marshalls\u2019 litigation has worked its way\nthrough state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and\nCalifornia, and two of those courts\u2014a Texas state probate court and\nthe Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California\u2014have\nreached contrary decisions on its mer-its. The Court of Appeals\nbelow held that the Texas state decision controlled, after\nconcluding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to enter\nfinal judgment on a counterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce\nin her bankruptcy proceeding.[Footnote 1] To determine whether the Court of Appeals was\ncorrect in that regard, we must resolve two issues: (1) whether the\nBankruptcy Court had the statutory authority under 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7157(b) to issue a final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim; and (2)\nif so, whether conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is\nconstitutional.Although the history of this litigation is\ncomplicated, its resolution ultimately turns on very basic\nprinciples. Article III, \u00a71, of the Constitution commands that\n\u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from\ntime to time ordain and establish.\u201d That Article further provides\nthat the judges of those courts shall hold their offices during\ngood behavior, without diminution of salary.Ibid.Those\nrequirements of Article III were not honored here. The Bankruptcy\nCourt in this case exercised the judicial power of the United\nStates by entering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even\nthough the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure during good\nbehavior nor salary protection. We conclude that, although the\nBankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do\nso.IBecause we have already recounted\nthe facts and procedural history of this case in detail, seeMarshallv.Marshall,547 U. S. 293, 300\u2013305\n(2006), we do not repeat them in full here. Of current relevance\nare two claims Vickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J.\nHoward\u2019s fortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith, Vickie\nwas J. Howard\u2019s third wife and married him about a year before his\ndeath.Id.,at 300; seeIn reMarshall,\n392 F.\u00a03d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard bestowed\non Vickie many monetary and other gifts during their courtship and\nmarriage, he did not include her in his will. 547 U. S., at 300.\nBefore J. Howard passed away, Vickie filed suit in Texas state\nprobate court, asserting that Pierce\u2014J. Howard\u2019s younger\nson\u2014fraudulently induced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did\nnot include her, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his\nproperty. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and defended the\nvalidity of J. Howard\u2019s trust and, eventually, his will. 392\nF.\u00a03d, at 1122\u20131123, 1125.After J. Howard\u2019s death, Vickie\nfiled a petition for bankruptcy in the Central District of\nCalifornia. Pierce filed a complaint in that bankruptcy proceeding,\ncontending that Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to\ntell members of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain\ncontrol of his father\u2019s assets. 547 U. S., at 300\u2013301;In\nreMarshall, 600 F.\u00a03d 1037, 1043\u20131044 (CA9\n2010). The complaint sought a declaration that Pierce\u2019s defamation\nclaim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceedings.Ibid.; see 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7523(a). Pierce subsequently\nfiled a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning that he\nsought to recover damages for it from Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy estate.\nSee \u00a7501(a). Vickie responded to Pierce\u2019s initial complaint by\nasserting truth as a defense to the alleged defamation and by\nfiling a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she\nexpected from J. Howard. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged\nthat Pierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking the\nlegal steps necessary to provide her with half his property. 547 U.\nS., at 301.On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court\nissued an order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce\u2019s claim\nfor defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a bench trial, the\nBankruptcy Court issued a judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim in her\nfavor. The court later awarded Vickie over $400 million in\ncompensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. 600\nF.\u00a03d, at 1045; see 253 B.\u00a0R. 550, 561\u2013562 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nCD Cal. 2000); 257 B.\u00a0R. 35, 39\u201340 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.\n2000).In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that\nthe Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made\nearlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\nauthority over the counterclaim was limited because Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B.\u00a0R., at 39. As explained below,\nbankruptcy courts may hear and en- ter final judgments in \u201ccore\nproceedings\u201d in a bankruptcy case. In non-core proceedings, the\nbankruptcy courts instead submit proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law to the district court, for that court\u2019s review\nand issuance of final judgment. The Bankruptcy Court in this case\nconcluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was \u201ca core proceeding\u201d under\n\u00a7157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had the \u201cpower to enter\njudgment\u201d on the counterclaim under \u00a7157(b)(1).Id., at\n40.The District Court disagreed. It recognized\nthat \u201cVickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within\nthe literal language\u201d of the statute designating certain\nproceedings as \u201ccore,\u201d see \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), but understood this\nCourt\u2019s precedent to \u201csuggest[\u00a0] that it would be\nunconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\u201d\n264 B.\u00a0R. 609, 629\u2013630 (CD Cal. 2001) (citingNorthern\nPipeline Constr. Co.v.Marathon Pipe Line Co.,458 U. S. 50, 79, n. 31 (1982)\n(plurality opinion)). The District Court accordingly concluded that\na \u201ccounterclaim should not be characterized as core\u201d when it \u201cis\nonly somewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted,\nand when the unique characteristics and context of the counterclaim\nplace it outside of the normal type of set-off or other\ncounterclaims that customarily arise.\u201d 264 B.\u00a0R., at 632.Because the District Court concluded that\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim was not core, the court determined that it\nwas required to treat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment as\n\u201cproposed[,] rather than final,\u201d and engage in an \u201cindependent\nreview\u201d of the record.Id.,at 633; see 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7157(c)(1). Although the Texas state court had by that time\nconducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute and\nentered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the District Court declined\nto give that judgment preclusive effect and went on to decide the\nmatter itself. 271 B.\u00a0R. 858, 862\u2013867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275\nB.\u00a0R. 5, 56\u201358 (CD Cal. 2002). Like the Bankruptcy Court, the\nDistrict Court found that Pierce had tortiously interfered with\nVickie\u2019s expectancy of a gift from J. Howard. The District Court\nawarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each in the\namount of $44,292,767.33.Id.,at 58.The Court of Appeals reversed the District\nCourt on a different ground, 392 F.\u00a03d, at 1137, and we\u2014in the\nfirst visit of the case to this Court\u2014reversed the Court of Appeals\non that issue. 547 U. S., at 314\u2013315. On remand from this Court,\nthe Court of Appeals held that \u00a7157 mandated \u201ca two-step approach\u201d\nunder which a bankruptcy judge may issue a final judgment in a\nproceeding only if the matter both \u201cmeets Congress\u2019 definition of a\ncore proceedingandarises under or arises in title 11,\u201d\nthe Bankruptcy Code. 600 F.\u00a03d, at 1055. The court also\nreasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final judgments\non all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy proceedings \u201cwould\ncertainly run afoul\u201d of this Court\u2019s decision inNorthern\nPipeline. 600 F.\u00a03d, at 1057. With those concerns in\nmind, the court concluded that \u201ca counterclaim under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C)\nis properly a \u2018core\u2019 proceeding \u2018arising in a case under\u2019 the\n[Bankruptcy] Code only if the counterclaim is so closely related to\n[a creditor\u2019s] proof of claim that the resolution of the\ncounterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance\nof the claim itself.\u201dId.,at 1058 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; second brackets added). The court ruled that\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim did not meet that test.Id.,at\n1059. That holding made \u201cthe Texas probate court\u2019s judgment \u2026 the\nearliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this\nproceeding,\u201d and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nDistrict Court should have \u201cafford[ed] preclusive effect\u201d to the\nTexas \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of relevant legal and factual issues.\u201dId.,at 1064\u20131065.[Footnote 2]We again granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __\n(2010).IIAWith certain exceptions not\nrelevant here, the district courts of the United States have\n\u201coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.\u201d\n28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(a). Congress has divided bankruptcy\nproceedings into three categories: those that \u201caris[e] under title\n11\u201d; those that \u201caris[e] in\u201d a Title 11 case; and those that are\n\u201crelated to a case under title 11.\u201d \u00a7157(a). District courts may\nrefer any or all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their\ndistrict,ibid., which is how the Bankruptcy Court in this\ncase came to preside over Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. District\ncourts also may withdraw a case or proceeding referred to the\nbankruptcy court \u201cfor cause shown.\u201d \u00a7157(d). Since Congress enacted\nthe Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 (the\n1984 Act), bankruptcy judges for each district have been appointed\nto 14-year terms by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which\ntheir district is located. \u00a7152(a)(1).The manner in which a bankruptcy\njudge may act on a referred matter depends on the type of\nproceeding involved. Bankruptcy judges may hear and enter final\njudgments in \u201call core proceedings arising under title 11, or\narising in a case under title 11.\u201d \u00a7157(b)(1). \u201cCore proceedings\ninclude, but are not limited to\u201d 16 different types of matters,\nincluding \u201ccounterclaims by [a debtor\u2019s] estate against persons\nfiling claims against the estate.\u201d \u00a7157(b)(2)(C).[Footnote 3] Parties may appeal final\njudgments of a bankruptcy court in core proceedings to the district\ncourt, which reviews them under traditional appellate standards.\nSee \u00a7158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013.When a bankruptcy judge determines that a\nreferred \u201cpro-ceeding \u2026 is not a core proceeding but \u2026 is other-\nwise related to a case under title 11,\u201d the judge may only \u201csubmit\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district\ncourt.\u201d \u00a7157(c)(1). It is the district court that enters final\njudgment in such cases after reviewingde novoany matter\nto which a party objects.Ibid.BVickie\u2019s counterclaim against\nPierce for tortious interference is a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under the\nplain text of \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). That provision specifies that core\nproceedings include \u201ccounterclaims by the estate against persons\nfiling claims against the estate.\u201d In past cases, we have suggested\nthat a proceeding\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d status alone authorizes a bankruptcy\njudge, as a statutory matter, to enter final judgment in the\nproceeding. See, e.g.,Granfinanciera, S. A.v.Nordberg,492 U.\nS. 33, 50 (1989) (explaining that Congress had designated\ncertain actions as \u201c\u00a0\u2018core proceedings,\u2019 which bankruptcy\njudges may adjudicate and in which they may issue final judgments,\nif a district court has referred the matter to them\u201d (citations\nomitted)). We have not directly addressed the question, however,\nand Pierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment\non a core proceeding only if that proceeding also \u201caris[es] in\u201d a\nTitle 11 case or \u201caris[es] under\u201d Title 11 itself. Brief for\nRespondent 51 (internal quotation marks omitted).Section 157(b)(1) authorizes\nbankruptcy courts to \u201chear and determine all cases under title 11\nand all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a\ncase under title 11.\u201d As written, \u00a7157(b)(1) is ambiguous. The\n\u201carising under\u201d and \u201carising in\u201d phrases might, as Pierce suggests,\nbe read as referring to a limited category of those core\nproceedings that are addressed in that section. On the other hand,\nthe phrases might be read as simply describing what core\nproceedings are: matters arising under Title 11 or in a Title 11\ncase. In this case the structure and context of \u00a7157 contradict\nPierce\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7157(b)(1).As an initial matter, Pierce\u2019s reading of the\nstatute necessarily assumes that there is a category of core\nproceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a Title\n11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates the bankruptcy\ncourts\u2019 authority, however, makes plain that no such category\nexists. Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy judges to enter\nfinal judgments in \u201ccore proceedings arising under title 11, or\narising in a case under title 11.\u201d Section 157(c)(1) instructs\nbankruptcy judges to instead submit proposed findings in \u201ca\nproceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise\nrelated to a case under title 11.\u201d Nowhere does \u00a7157 specify what\nbankruptcy courts are to do with respect to the category of matters\nthat Pierce posits\u2014core proceedings that donotarise\nunder Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. To the contrary, \u00a7157(b)(3)\nonly instructs a bankruptcy judge to \u201cdetermine, on the judge\u2019s own\nmotion or on timely motion of a party, whether a proceeding is a\ncore proceeding under this subsection or is a proceeding that is\notherwise related to a case under title 11.\u201d Two options. The\nstatute does not suggest that any other distinctions need be\nmade.Under our reading of the statute, core\nproceedings are those that arise in a bankruptcy case or under\nTitle 11. The detailed list of core proceedings in \u00a7157(b)(2) pro-\nvides courts with ready examples of such matters. Pierce\u2019s reading\nof \u00a7157, in contrast, supposes that some core pro-ceedings will\narise in a Title 11 case or under Title 11 and some will not. Under\nthat reading, the statute provides no guidance on how to tell which\nare which.We think it significant that Congress failed\nto provide any framework for identifying or adjudicating the\nasserted category of core but not \u201carising\u201d proceedings, given the\notherwise detailed provisions governing bankruptcy court authority.\nIt is hard to believe that Congress would go to the trouble of\ncataloging 16 different types of proceedings that should receive\n\u201ccore\u201d treatment, but then fail to specify how to determine whether\nthose matters arise under Title 11 or in a bankruptcy case if\u2014as\nPierce asserts\u2014the latter inquiry is determinative of the\nbankruptcy court\u2019s authority.Pierce argues that we should treat core\nmatters that arise neither under Title 11 nor in a Title 11 case as\nproceedings \u201crelated to\u201d a Title 11 case. Brief for Respondent 60\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We think that a contradiction\nin terms. It does not make sense to describe a \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy\nproceeding as merely \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy case; oxymoron is\nnot a typical feature of congressional drafting. SeeNorthern\nPipeline, 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing\n\u201cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the\ncore of the federal bankruptcy power, \u2026 from the adjudication of\nstate-created private rights\u201d); Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b63.02[2],\np.\u00a03\u201326, n. 5 (16th ed. 2010) (\u201cThe terms \u2018non-core\u2019 and\n\u2018related\u2019 are synonymous\u201d); see alsoid.,at 3\u201326, (\u201cThe\nphraseology of section 157 leads to the conclusion that there is no\nsuch thing as a core matter that is \u2018related to\u2019 a case under title\n11. Core proceedings are, at most, those that arise in title 11\ncases or arise under title 11\u201d (footnote omitted)). And, as already\ndiscussed, the statute simply does not provide for a proceeding\nthat is simultaneously core and yet only related to the bankruptcy\ncase. See \u00a7157(c)(1) (providing only for \u201ca proceeding that is not\na core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under\ntitle 11\u201d).As we explain in Part III, we agree with\nPierce that designating all counterclaims as \u201ccore\u201d proceedings\nraises serious constitutional concerns. Pierce is also correct that\nwe will, where possible, construe federal statutes so as \u201cto avoid\nserious doubt of their constitutionality.\u201dCommod-ity Futures\nTrading Comm\u2019nv.Schor,478 U. S. 833, 841 (1986) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But that \u201ccanon of construction does not\ngive [us] the prerogative to ignore the legislative will in order\nto avoid constitutional adjudication.\u201dIbid.In this case,\nwe do not think the plain text of \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) leaves any room for\nthe canon of avoidance. We would have to \u201crewrit[e]\u201d the statute,\nnot interpret it, to bypass the constitutional issue \u00a7157(b)(2)(C)\npresents.Id., at 841 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThat we may not do. We agree with Vickie that \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) permits\nthe bankruptcy court to enter a final judgment on her tortious\ninterference counterclaim.CPierce argues, as another\nalternative to reaching the constitutional question, that the\nBankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter final judgment on his\ndefamation claim. Section 157(b)(5) provides that \u201c[t]he district\ncourt shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death\nclaims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy\ncase is pending, or in the district court in the district in which\nthe claim arose.\u201d Pierce asserts that his defamation claim is a\n\u201cpersonal injury tort,\u201d that the Bankruptcy Court therefore had no\njurisdiction over that claim, and that the court therefore\nnecessarily lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as well.\nBrief for Respondent 65\u201366.Vickie objects to Pierce\u2019s\nstatutory analysis across the board. To begin, Vickie contends that\n\u00a7157(b)(5) does not address subject matter jurisdiction at all, but\nsimply specifies the venue in which \u201cpersonal injury tort and\nwrongful death claims\u201d should be tried. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 16\u201317, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Deputy\nSolicitor General) (Section \u201c157(b)(5) is in [the United States\u2019]\nview not jurisdictional\u201d). Given the limited scope of that\nprovision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or for-feit any\nobjections under \u00a7157(b)(5), in the same way that a party may waive\nor forfeit an objection to the bankruptcy court finally resolving a\nnon-core claim. Reply Brief for Petitioner 17\u201320; see \u00a7157(c)(2)\n(authorizing the district court, \u201cwith the consent of all the\nparties to the proceeding,\u201d to refer a \u201crelated to\u201d matter to the\nbankruptcy court for final judgment). Vickie asserts that in this\ncase Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s adjudication of his\ndefamation claim, and forfeited any argument to the contrary, by\nfailing to seek withdrawal of the claim until he had litigated it\nbefore the Bankruptcy Court for 27 months.Id.,at 20\u201323.\nOn the merits, Vickie contends that the statutory phrase \u201cpersonal\ninjury tort and wrongful death claims\u201d does not include\nnon-physical torts such as defamation.Id.,at 25\u201326.We need not determine what constitutes a\n\u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d in this case because we agree with Vickie\nthat \u00a7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented to\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defamation claim.[Footnote 4] Because \u201c[b]randing a rule\nas going to a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal\noperation of our adversarial system,\u201dHendersonv.Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at\n4\u20135), we are not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a\njurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such. See generallyArbaughv.Y & H Corp.,546 U. S. 500, 516 (2006) (\u201cwhen\nCongress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as\njurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as\nnonjurisdictional in character\u201d).Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks\nof a jurisdictional decree. To begin, the statutory text does not\nrefer to either district court or bankruptcy court \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d\ninstead addressing only where personal injury tort claims \u201cshall be\ntried.\u201dThe statutory context also belies Pierce\u2019s\njurisdictional claim. Section 157 allocates the authority to enter\nfinal judgment between the bankruptcy court and the district court.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), (c)(1). That allocation does not implicate\nquestions of subject matter jurisdiction. See \u00a7157(c)(2) (parties\nmay consent to entry of final judgment by bankruptcy judge in\nnon-core case). By the same token, \u00a7157(b)(5) simply specifies\nwhere a particular category of cases should be tried. Pierce does\nnot explain why that statutory limitation may not be similarly\nwaived.We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only\ncould but did consent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his\ndefamation claim. Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie objected to\nPierce\u2019s proof of claim for defamation, arguing that Pierce\u2019s claim\nwas unenforceable and that Pierce should not receive any amount for\nit. See 29 Court of Appeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031,\n6035 (hereinafter Supplemental Record). Vickie also noted that the\nBankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objection, given the\nlitigation posture of Pierce\u2019s claim before the Bankruptcy Court.\nSeeid.,at 6031. Vickie\u2019s filing prompted Pierce to\nadvise the Bankruptcy Court that \u201c[a]ll parties are in agreement\nthat the amount of the contingent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce]\nshall be determined by the adversary proceedings\u201d that had been\ncommenced in the Bankruptcy Court. 31 Supplemental Record 6801.\nPierce asserted that Vickie\u2019s objection should be overruled or,\nalternatively, that any ruling on the objection \u201cshould be\ncontinued until the resolution of the pending adversary proceeding\nlitigation.\u201dIbid.Pierce identifies no point in the\nrecord where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that it lacked the\nauthority to adjudicate his proof of claim because the claim sought\nrecompense for a personal injury tort.Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to\nany court that \u00a7157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from\nresolving his defamation claim until over two years\u2014and several\nadverse discovery rulings\u2014after he filed that claim in June 1996.\nThe first filing Pierce cites as rais- ing that objection is his\nSeptember 22, 1998 motion to the District Court to withdraw the\nreference of the case to the Bankruptcy Court. See Brief for\nRespondent 26\u201327. The District Court did initially withdraw the\nreference as requested, but it then returned the proceeding to the\nBankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce \u201cimplicated the\njurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a party to\nthat litigation.\u201d App.\u00a0129. Although Pierce had objected in\nJuly 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim, he advised the court at that time that he\nwas \u201chappy to litigate [his] claim\u201d there. 29 Supplemental Record\n6101. Counsel stated that even though Pierce thought it was\n\u201cprobably cheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce\u2019s claim] were sent\nback or joined back with the State Court litigation,\u201d Pierce \u201cdid\nchoose\u201d the Bankruptcy Court forum and \u201cwould be more than pleased\nto do it [t]here.\u201dId.,at 6101\u20136102; see also App. to\nPet. for Cert. 266, n.\u00a017 (District Court referring to these\nstatements).Given Pierce\u2019s course of conduct before the\nBankruptcy Court, we conclude that he consented to that court\u2019s\nresolution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument to\nthe contrary). We have recognized \u201cthe value of waiver and\nforfeiture rules\u201d in \u201ccomplex\u201d cases,Exxon Shipping Co.v.Baker,554 U. S. 471, 487\u2013488,\nn. 6 (2008), and this case is no exception. In such cases, as here,\nthe consequences of \u201ca litigant \u2026 \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014remaining\nsilent about his objection and belatedly raising the error only if\nthe case does not conclude in his favor,\u201dPuckettv.United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014can be particularly severe.\nIf Pierce believed that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority\nto decide his claim for defamation, then he should have said so\u2014and\nsaid so promptly. SeeUnited Statesv.Olano,507 U. S. 725,\n731 (1993) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018No procedural principle is more familiar to\nthis Court than that a constitutional right,\u2019 or a right of any\nother sort, \u2018may be forfeited \u2026 by the failure to make timely\nassertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to\ndetermine it\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingYakusv.United\nStates,321 U.\nS. 414, 444 (1944))). Instead, Pierce repeatedly stated to the\nBankruptcy Court that he was happy to litigate there. We will not\nconsider his claim to the contrary, now that he is sad.IIIAlthough we conclude that\n\u00a7157(b)(2)(C) permits the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judgment\non Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution does\nnot.AArticle III, \u00a71, of the\nConstitution mandates that \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United\nStates, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior\nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d\nThe same section provides that the judges of those constitutional\ncourts \u201cshall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\u201d and\n\u201creceive for their Services[\u00a0] a Compensation[\u00a0] [that]\nshall not be diminished\u201d during their tenure.As its text and our precedent\nconfirm, Article III is \u201can inseparable element of the\nconstitutional system of checks and balances\u201d that \u201cboth defines\nthe power and protects the independence of the Judicial Branch.\u201dNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion).\nUnder \u201cthe basic concept of separation of powers \u2026 that flow[s]\nfrom the scheme of a tripartite government\u201d adopted in the\nConstitution, \u201cthe \u2018judicial Power of the United States\u2019 \u2026 can no\nmore be shared\u201d with another branch than \u201cthe Chief Executive, for\nexample, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the\nCongress share with the Judiciary the power to override a\nPresidential veto.\u201dUnited Statesv.Nixon,418 U. S. 683,\n704 (1974) (quoting U. S. Const., Art.\u00a0III, \u00a71).In establishing the system of divided power in\nthe Constitution, the Framers considered it essential that \u201cthe\njudiciary remain[\u00a0] truly distinct from both the legisla- ture\nand the executive.\u201d The Federalist No.\u00a078, p.\u00a0466 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). As Hamilton put it, quoting\nMontesquieu, \u201c\u00a0\u2018there is no liberty if the power of judging be\nnot separated from the legislative and executive powers.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting 1 Montesquieu, Spirit of Laws 181).We have recognized that the three branches are\nnot hermetically sealed from one another, seeNixonv.Administrator of General Services,433 U. S. 425, 443\n(1977), but it remains true that Article III imposes some basic\nlimitations that the other branches may not transgress. Those\nlimitations serve two related purposes. \u201cSeparation-of-powers\nprinciples are intended, in part, to protect each branch of\ngovernment from incursion by the others. Yet the dynamic between\nand among the branches is not the only object of the Constitution\u2019s\nconcern. The structural principles secured by the separation of\npowers protect the individual as well.\u201dBondv.United\nStates, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).Article III protects liberty not only through\nits role in implementing the separation of powers, but also by\nspecifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The\ncolonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand of the\nCrown, and the Framers knew the main reasons why: because the King\nof Great Britain \u201cmade Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the\ntenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their\nsalaries.\u201d The Declaration of Independence \u00b611. The Framers\nundertook in Article III to protect citizens subject to the\njudicial power of the new Federal Government from a repeat of those\nabuses. By appointing judges to serve without term limits, and\nrestricting the ability of the other branches to remove judges or\ndiminish their salaries, the Framers sought to ensure that each\njudicial decision would be rendered, not with an eye toward\ncurrying favor with Congress or the Executive, but rather with the\n\u201c[c]lear heads \u2026 and honest hearts\u201d deemed \u201cessential to good\njudges.\u201d 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896).Article III could neither serve its purpose in\nthe system of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of\njudicial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal\nGovernment could confer the Government\u2019s \u201cjudicial Power\u201d on\nentities outside Article III. That is why we have long recognized\nthat, in general, Congress may not \u201cwithdraw from judicial\ncognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a\nsuit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201dMurray\u2019s\nLesseev.Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How.\n272, 284 (1856). When a suit is made of \u201cthe stuff of the\ntraditional actions at common law tried by the courts at\nWestminster in 1789,\u201dNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 90\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment), and is brought within the\nbounds of federal jurisdiction, the responsibility for deciding\nthat suit rests with Article III judges in Article III courts. The\nConstitution assigns that job\u2014resolution of \u201cthe mundane as well as\nthe glamorous, matters of common law and statute as well as\nconstitutional law, issues of fact as well as issues of law\u201d\u2014to the\nJudiciary.Id.,at 86\u201387, n. 39 (plurality opinion).BThis is not the first time we\nhave faced an Article III challenge to a bankruptcy court\u2019s\nresolution of a debtor\u2019s suit. InNorthern Pipeline,we\nconsidered whether bankruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy\nAct of 1978\u2014appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\nbut lacking the tenure and salary guarantees of Article III\u2014could\n\u201cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a]\nstate-law contract claim\u201d against an entity that was not otherwise\npart of the bankruptcy proceedings. 458 U. S., at 53, 87, n. 40\n(plurality opinion); seeid.,at 89\u201392 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The Court concluded that assignment of\nsuch state law claims for resolution by those judges \u201cviolates\nArt.\u00a0III of the Con-stitution.\u201dId.,at 52, 87\n(plurality opinion);id.,at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring\nin judgment).The plurality inNorthern\nPipelinerecognized that there was a category of cases\ninvolving \u201cpublic rights\u201d that Congress could constitutionally\nassign to \u201clegislative\u201d courts for resolution. That opinion\nconcluded that this \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception extended \u201conly to\nmatters arising between\u201d individuals and the Government \u201cin\nconnection with the performance of the constitutional functions of\nthe executive or legislative departments \u2026 that historically could\nhave been determined exclusively by those\u201d branches.Id.,at 67\u201368 (internal quotation marks omitted). A full majority of the\nCourt, while not agreeing on the scope of the exception, concluded\nthat the doctrine did not encompass adjudication of the state law\nclaim at issue in that case.Id.,at 69\u201372; seeid.,at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\u201cNone of the [previous cases addressing Article III power] has\ngone so far as to sanction the type of adjudication to which\nMarathon will be subjected \u2026\u00a0. To whatever extent different\npowers granted under [the 1978] Act might be sustained under the\n\u2018public rights\u2019 doctrine ofMurray\u2019s Lessee\u2026 and\nsucceeding cases, I am satisfied that the adjudication of\nNorthern\u2019s lawsuit cannot be so sustained\u201d).[Footnote 5]A full majority of Justices inNorthern\nPipelinealso rejected the debtor\u2019s argument that the\nbankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was constitutional\nbecause the bankruptcy judge was acting merely as an adjunct of the\ndistrict court or court of appeals.Id.,at 71\u201372, 81\u201386\n(plurality opinion);id.,at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cthe bankruptcy court is not an \u2018adjunct\u2019 of either\nthe district court or the court of appeals\u201d).After our decision inNorthern\nPipeline, Congress revised the statutes governing bankruptcy\njurisdiction and bankruptcy judges. In the 1984 Act, Congress\nprovided that the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be\nappointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which their\ndistricts are located. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7152(a). And, as we have\nexplained, Congress permitted the newly constituted bankruptcy\ncourts to enter final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d proceedings. Seesupra,at 7\u20138.With respect to such \u201ccore\u201d matters, however,\nthe bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same powers\nthey wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978 Act), 92 Stat.\n2549. As inNorthern Pipeline,for example, the newly\nconstituted bankruptcy courts are charged under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) with\nresolving \u201c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the\nlaw to which\u201d a counterclaim may lead. 458 U. S., at 91 (Rehnquist,\nJ., concurring in judgment); see,e.g.,275 B.\u00a0R., at\n50\u201351 (noting that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim required the bankruptcy\ncourt to determine whether Texas recognized a cause of ac- tion for\ntortious interference with aninter vivosgift\u2014something\nthe Supreme Court of Texas had yet to do). As inNorthern\nPipeline, the new courts in core proceedings \u201cissue final\njudgments, which are binding and enforceable even in the absence of\nan appeal.\u201d 458 U. S., at 85\u201386 (plurality opinion). And, as inNorthern Pipeline, the district courts review the\njudgments of the bankruptcy courts in core proceedings only under\nthe usual limited appellate standards. That requires marked\ndeference to, among other things, the bankruptcy judges\u2019 findings\nof fact. See \u00a7158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of\nfact \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d).CVickie and the dissent argue that\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s entry of final judgment on her state common\nlaw counterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities\nbetween the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and those\nexercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We disagree. It is\nclear that the Bankruptcy Court in this case exercised the\n\u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d in purporting to resolve and\nenter final judgment on a state common law claim, just as the court\ndid inNorthern Pipeline. No \u201cpublic right\u201d exception\nexcuses the failure to comply with Article III in doing so, any\nmore than inNorthern Pipeline. Vickie argues that this\ncase is different because the defendant is a creditor in the\nbankruptcy. But the debtors\u2019 claims in the cases on which she\nrelies were themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law, which\nwould be completely resolved in the bankruptcy process of allowing\nor disallowing claims. Here Vickie\u2019s claim is a state law action\nindependent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily\nresolvable by a ruling on the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in\nbankruptcy.Northern Pipelineand our subsequent decision\ninGranfinanciera,492 U.\nS. 33, rejected the application of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d\nexception in such cases.Nor can the bankruptcy courts\nunder the 1984 Act be dismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III\ncourts, any more than could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978\nAct. The judicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this\nremain the same, and a court exercising such broad powers is no\nmere adjunct of anyone.1Vickie\u2019s counterclaim cannot be\ndeemed a matter of \u201cpublic right\u201d that can be decided outside the\nJudicial Branch. As explained above, inNorthern Pipelinewe rejected the argument that the public rights doctrine permitted\na bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law suit brought by a\ndebtor against a company that had not filed a claim against the\nestate. See 458 U. S., at 69\u201372 (plurality opinion);id.,at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). Although our\ndiscussion of the public rights exception since that time has not\nbeen entirely consistent, and the exception has been the subject of\nsome debate, this case does not fall within any of the various\nformulations of the concept that appear in this Court\u2019s\nopinions.We first recognized the category\nof public rights inMur-ray\u2019s Lesseev.Hoboken Land\n& Improvement Co., 18 How. 272 (1856). That case involved\nthe Treasury Department\u2019s sale of property belonging to a customs\ncollector who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal\nGovernment that he had collected on its behalf.Id.,at\n274, 275. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land through\na different transfer, objected that the Treasury Department\u2019s\ncalculation of the deficiency and sale of the property was void,\nbecause it was a judicial act that could not be assigned to the\nExecutive under Article III.Id.,at 274\u2013275, 282\u2013283.\u201cTo avoid misconstruction upon so grave a\nsubject,\u201d the Court laid out the principles guiding its analysis.Id.,at 284. It confirmed that Congress cannot \u201cwithdraw\nfrom judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the\nsubject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201dIbid.The Court also recognized that \u201c[a]t the same time\nthere are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented\nin such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them,\nand which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which\ncongress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts\nof the United States, as it may deem proper.\u201dIbid.As an example of such matters, the Court\nreferred to \u201c[e]quitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded\nterritories\u201d and cited cases in which land issues were conclusively\nresolved by Executive Branch officials.Ibid.(citingFoleyv.Harrison, 15 How. 433 (1854);Burgessv.Gray, 16 How. 48 (1854)). In those\ncases \u201cit depends upon the will of congress whether a remedy in the\ncourts shall be allowed at all,\u201d so Congress could limit the extent\nto which a judicial forum was available.Murray\u2019s Lessee,\n18 How., at 284. The challenge inMurray\u2019sLesseeto the Treasury Department\u2019s sale of the collector\u2019s land likewise\nfell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category of cases, because it could\nonly be brought if the Federal Government chose to allow it by\nwaiving sovereign immunity.Id.,at 283\u2013284. The point ofMurray\u2019s Lesseewas simply that Congress may set the terms\nof adjudicating a suit when the suit could not otherwise proceed at\nall.Subsequent decisions from this Court\ncontrasted cases within the reach of the public rights\nexception\u2014those arising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject\nto its authority in connection with the performance of the\nconstitutional functions of the executive or legislative\ndepartments\u201d\u2014and those that were instead matters \u201cof private right,\nthat is, of the liability of one individual to another under the\nlaw as defined.\u201dCrowellv.Benson,285 U. S. 22, 50, 51\n(1932).[Footnote 6] SeeAtlas Roofing Co.v.Occupational Safety and Health\nReview Comm\u2019n,430 U. S. 442, 458\n(1977) (Exception extends to cases \u201cwhere the Government is\ninvolved in its sovereign capacity under \u2026 [a] statute creating\nenforceable public rights,\u201d while \u201c[w]holly private tort, contract,\nand property cases, as well as a vast range of other cases \u2026 are\nnot at all implicated\u201d);Ex parte Bakelite Corp.,279 U. S. 438, 451\u2013452\n(1929). See alsoNorthern Pipeline,supra,at 68\n(plurality opinion) (citingEx parte Bakelite Corp.for\nthe proposition that the doctrine extended \u201conly to matters that\nhistorically could have been determined exclusively by\u201d the\nExecutive and Legislative Branches).Shortly afterNorthern Pipeline, the\nCourt rejected the limitation of the public rights exception to\nactions involving the Government as a party. The Court has\ncontinued, however, to limit the exception to cases in which the\nclaim at issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in\nwhich resolution of the claim by an expert government agency is\ndeemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within the\nagency\u2019s authority. In other words, it is still the case that what\nmakes a right \u201cpublic\u201d rather than private is that the right is\nintegrally related to particular federal government action. SeeUnited Statesv.Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.\nS. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 10\u201311) (\u201cThe distinction\nbetween \u2018public rights\u2019 against the Government and \u2018private rights\u2019\nbetween private parties is well established,\u201d citingMurray\u2019s\nLesseeandCrowell).Our decision inThomasv.Union\nCarbide Agricultural Products Co., for example, involved a\ndata-sharing arrangement between companies under a federal statute\npro-viding that disputes about compensation between the companies\nwould be decided by binding arbitration.473 U. S. 568, 571\u2013575\n(1985). This Court held that the scheme did not violate Article\nIII, explaining that \u201c[a]ny right to compensation \u2026 results from\n[the statute] and does not depend on or replace a right to such\ncompensation under state law.\u201dId.,at 584.Commodity Futures Trading Commissionv.Schorconcerned a statutory scheme that created a\nprocedure for customers injured by a broker\u2019s violation of the\nfederal commodities law to seek reparations from the broker before\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).478 U. S. 833, 836 (1986). A customer\nfiled such a claim to recover a debit balance in his account, while\nthe broker filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court to recover the\nsame amount as lawfully due from the customer. The broker later\nsubmitted its claim to the CFTC, but after that agency ruled\nagainst the customer, the customer argued that agency jurisdiction\nover the broker\u2019s counterclaim violated Article III.Id.,at 837\u2013838. This Court disagreed, but only after observing that (1)\nthe claim and the counterclaim concerned a \u201csingle dispute\u201d\u2014the\nsame account balance; (2) the CFTC\u2019s assertion of authority\ninvolved only \u201ca narrow class of common law claims\u201d in a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018particularized area of law\u2019\u00a0\u201d; (3) the area of law in\nquestion was governed by \u201ca specific and limited federal regulatory\nscheme\u201d as to which the agency had \u201cobvious expertise\u201d; (4) the\nparties had freely elected to resolve their differences before the\nCFTC; and (5) CFTC orders were \u201cenforceable only by order of the\ndistrict court.\u201dId.,at 844, 852\u2013855 (quotingNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85); see 478 U. S., at\n843\u2013844; 849\u2013857. Most significantly, given that the customer\u2019s\nreparations claim before the agency and the broker\u2019s counterclaim\nwere competing claims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly\nemphasized that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the agency to exercise\njurisdiction over the broker\u2019s claim, or else \u201cthe reparations\nprocedure would have been confounded.\u201dId.,at 856.The most recent case in which we considered\napplication of the public rights exception\u2014and the only case in\nwhich we have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy context\nsinceNorthern Pipeline\u2014isGranfinanciera, S. A.v.Nordberg,492 U.\nS. 33(1989). InGranfinancierawe rejected a\nbankruptcy trustee\u2019s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action\nfiled on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a\nbankruptcy proceeding fell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception. We\nexplained that, \u201c[i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined\nwith a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact, and\nif that right neither belongs to nor exists against the Federal\nGovernment, then it must be adjudicated by an Article III court.\u201dId.,at 54\u201355. We reasoned that fraudulent conveyance\nsuits were \u201cquintessentially suits at common law that more nearly\nresemble state law contract claims brought by a bankrupt\ncorporation to augment the bankruptcy estate than they do\ncreditors\u2019 hierarchically ordered claims to a pro rata share of the\nbankruptcy res.\u201dId.,at 56. As a consequence, we\nconcluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were \u201cmore accurately\ncharacterized as a private rather than a public right as we have\nused those terms in our Article III decisions.\u201dId.,at\n55.[Footnote 7]Vickie\u2019s counterclaim\u2014like the fraudulent\nconveyance claim at issue inGranfinanciera\u2014does not fall\nwithin any of the varied formulations of the public rights\nexception in this Court\u2019s cases. It is not a matter that can be\npursued only by grace of the other branches, as inMurray\u2019s\nLessee, 18 How., at 284, or one that \u201chistorically could have\nbeen determined exclusively by\u201d those branches,Northern\nPipeline,supra,at 68 (citingEx parte Bakelite\nCorp., 279 U. S., at 458). The claim is instead one under\nstate common law between two private parties. It does not\n\u201cdepend[\u00a0] on the will of congress,\u201dMurray\u2019s Lessee,supra,at 284; Congress has nothing to do with it.In addition, Vickie\u2019s claimed right to relief\ndoes not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as inThomas, 473 U. S., at 584\u2013585, orAtlas Roofing,\n430 U. S., at 458. It is not \u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d\nadjudication of a claim created by federal law, as inSchor, 478 U. S., at 856. And in contrast to the objecting\nparty inSchor,id.,at 855\u2013856, Pierce did not\ntruly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy\ncourt proceedings. He had nowhere else to go if he wished to\nrecover from Vickie\u2019s estate. SeeGranfinanciera,supra,at 59, n.\u00a014 (noting that \u201c[p]arallel\nreasoning [toSchor] is unavailable in the context of\nbankruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative forum\nto the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims\u201d).[Footnote 8]Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide\nVickie\u2019s claim is not limited to a \u201cparticularized area of the\nlaw,\u201d as inCrowell,Thomas, andSchor.Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).\nWe deal here not with an agency but with a court, with substantive\njurisdiction reaching any area of thecorpus juris. Seeibid.;id.,at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment). This is not a situation in which Congress devised an\n\u201cexpert and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of\nquestions of fact which are particularly suited to examination and\ndetermination by an administrative agency specially assigned to\nthat task.\u201dCrowell, 285 U. S., at 46; seeSchor,supra,at 855\u2013856. The \u201cexperts\u201d in the federal system at\nresolving common law counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s are the Article\nIII courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must\nstay.The dissent reads our cases differently, and\nin particular contends that more recent cases viewNorthern\nPipelineas \u201c\u00a0\u2018establish[ing] only that Congress may not\nvest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render\nfinal judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract\naction arising under state law, without consent of the litigants,\nand subject only to ordinary appellate review.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost,at 6 (quotingThomas,supra, at\n584). Just so: Substitute \u201ctort\u201d for \u201ccontract,\u201d and that statement\ndirectly covers this case.We recognize that there may be instances in\nwhich the distinction between public and private rights\u2014at least as\nframed by some of our recent cases\u2014fails to provide concrete\nguidance as to whether, for example, a particular agency can\nadjudicate legal issues under a substantive regulatory scheme.\nGiven the extent to which this case is so markedly distinct from\nthe agency cases discussing the public rights exception in the\ncontext of such a regime, however, we do not in this opinion\nexpress any view on how the doctrine might apply in that different\ncontext.What is plain here is that this case involves\nthe most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a\nfinal, binding judgmentby a courtwith broad substantive\njurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action\nneither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.\nIf such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from\nthe Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some\namorphous \u201cpublic right,\u201d then Article III would be transformed\nfrom the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers we\nhave long recognized into mere wishful thinking.2Vickie and the dissent next\nattempt to distinguishNorthern PipelineandGranfinancieraon the ground that Pierce, unlike the\ndefendants in those cases, had filed a proof of claim in the\nbankruptcy proceedings. Given Pierce\u2019s participation in those\nproceedings, Vickie argues, the Bankruptcy Court had the authority\nto adjudicate her counterclaim under our decisions inKatchenv.Landy,382 U. S. 323(1966),\nandLangenkampv.Culp,498 U. S. 42(1990)\n(per curiam).We do not agree. As an initial\nmatter, it is hard to see why Pierce\u2019s decision to file a claim\nshould make any difference with respect to the characterization of\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim. \u201c\u00a0\u2018[P]roperty interests are created and\ndefined by state law,\u2019 and \u2018[u]nless some federal interest requires\na different result, there is no reason why such interests should be\nanalyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved\nin a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201dTravelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of Americav.Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.,549 U. S. 443,\n451 (2007) (quotingButnerv.United States,440 U. S. 48, 55\n(1979)). Pierce\u2019s claim for defamation in no way affects the nature\nof Vickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference as one at common\nlaw that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\u2014the very\ntype of claim that we held inNorthern PipelineandGranfinancieramust be decided by an Article III\ncourt.Contrary to Vickie\u2019s contention, moreover, our\ndecisions inKatchenandLangenkampdo not\nsuggest a different result.Katchenpermitted a bankruptcy\nreferee acting under the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to\na bankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as \u201csummary\njurisdiction\u201d over a voidable preference claim brought by the\nbankruptcy trustee against a creditor who had filed a proof of\nclaim in the bankruptcy proceeding. See 382 U. S., at 325, 327\u2013328.\nA voidable preference claim asserts that a debtor made a payment to\na particular creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect\nincrease that creditor\u2019s proportionate share of the estate. The\npreferred creditor\u2019s claim in bankruptcy can be disallowed as a\nresult of the preference, and the amounts paid to that creditor can\nbe recovered by the trustee. Seeid.,at 330; see also 11\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7502(d), 547(b).Although the creditor inKatchenobjected that the preference issue should be resolved through a\n\u201cplenary suit\u201d in an Article III court, this Court concluded that\nsummary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate, because it was\nnot possible for the referee to rule on the creditor\u2019s proof of\nclaim without first resolving the voidable preference issue. 382 U.\nS., at 329\u2013330, 332\u2013333, and n.\u00a09, 334. There was no question\nthat the bankruptcy referee could decide whether there had been a\nvoidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to\nallow the creditor\u2019s claim. Once the referee did that, \u201cnothing\nremains for adjudication in a plenary suit\u201d; such a suit \u201cwould be\na meaningless gesture.\u201dId.,at 334. The plenary\nproceeding the creditor sought could be brought into the bankruptcy\ncourt because \u201cthe same issue [arose] as part of the process of\nallowance and disallowance of claims.\u201dId.,at 336.It was in that sense that the Court stated\nthat \u201che who invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a\nproof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the\nconsequences of that procedure.\u201dId.,at 333, n.\u00a09.\nInKatchenone of those consequences was resolution of the\npreference issue as part of the process of allowing or disallowing\nclaims, and accordingly there was no basis for the creditor to\ninsist that the issue be resolved in an Article III court. Seeid.,at 334. Indeed, theKatchenCourt expressly\nnoted that it \u201cintimate[d] no opinion concerning whether\u201d the\nbankruptcy referee would have had \u201csummary jurisdiction to\nadjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative\nrelief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which\nha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the\n[creditor\u2019s proof of] claim.\u201dId.,at 333, n.\u00a09.Ourper curiamopinion inLangenkampis to the same effect. We explained there that\na preferential transfer claim can be heard in bankruptcy when the\nallegedly favored creditor has filed a claim, becausethen\u201cthe ensuing preference action by the trustee become[s] integral to\nthe restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\u201d 498 U. S.,\nat 44. If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a proof of\nclaim, the trustee\u2019s preference action doesnot\u201cbecome[\u00a0] part of the claims-allowance process\u201d subject to\nresolution by the bankruptcy court.Ibid.; seeid.,at 45.In ruling on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, the\nBankruptcy Court was required to and did make several factual and\nlegal determinations that were not \u201cdisposed of in pass- ing on\nobjections\u201d to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defama- tion, which the\ncourt had denied almost a year earlier.Katchen,supra,at 332, n.\u00a09. There was some overlap between\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim and Pierce\u2019s defamation claim that led the\ncourts below to conclude that the counterclaim was compulsory, 600\nF.\u00a03d, at 1057, or at least in an \u201cattenuated\u201d sense related\nto Pierce\u2019s claim, 264 B.\u00a0R., at 631. But there was never any\nreason to believe that the process of adjudicating Pierce\u2019s proof\nof claim would necessarily resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. Seeid.,at 631, 632 (explaining that \u201cthe primary facts at\nissue on Pierce\u2019s claim were the relationship between Vickie and\nher attorneys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,\u201d\nand \u201cthe counterclaim raises issues of law entirely dif-ferent from\nthose raise[d] on the defamation claim\u201d). The United States\nacknowledges the point. See Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae,p.\u00a0(I) (question presented concerns authority of\na bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a compulsory\ncounterclaim \u201cwhen adjudication of the counterclaim requires\nresolution of issues that are not implicated by the claim against\nthe estate\u201d);id.,at 26.The only overlap between the two claims in\nthis case was the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously\ntaken control of his father\u2019s estate in the manner alleged by\nVickie in her counterclaim and described in the allegedly\ndefamatory statements. From the outset, it was clear that, even\nassuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it did) rule in Vickie\u2019s\nfavor on that question, the court could not enter judgment for\nVickie unless the court additionally ruled on the questions whether\nTexas recognized tortious interference with an expected gift as a\nvalid cause of action, what the elements of that action were, and\nwhether those elements were met in this case. 275 B.\u00a0R., at\n50\u201353. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted by other\njurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to prove, above and\nbeyond Pierce\u2019s tortious interference, (1) the existence of an\nexpectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable certainty that the\nexpectancy would have been realized but for the interference; and\n(3) damages.Id.,at 51; see 253 B.\u00a0R., at 558\u2013561.\nAlso, because Vickie sought punitive damages in connection with her\ncounterclaim, the Bankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the\ncase in Vickie\u2019s favor without determining whether to subject\nPierce to the sort of \u201cretribution,\u201d \u201cpunishment[,] and\ndeterrence,\u201dExxon Shipping Co., 554 U. S., at 492, 504\n(internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are designed to\nimpose. There thus was never reason to believe that the process of\nruling on Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily result in the\nresolution of Vickie\u2019s counterclaim.In bothKatchenandLangenkamp, moreover, the trustee bringing the preference\naction was asserting a right of recovery created by federal\nbankruptcy law. InLangen-kamp, we noted that \u201cthe trustee\ninstituted adversary proceedings under 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7547(b) to\nrecover, as avoidable preferences,\u201d payments respondents received\nfrom the debtor before the bankruptcy filings. 498 U. S., at 43;\nsee,e.g.,\u00a7547(b)(1) (\u201cthe trustee may avoid any transfer\nof an interest of the debtor in property\u2014(1) to or for the benefit\nof a creditor\u201d). InKatchen, \u201c[t]he Trustee \u2026 [asserted]\nthat the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences inhibited\nby Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d Memorandum Opinion (Feb. 8,\n1963), Tr. of Record in O.\u00a0T. 1965, No. 28, p.\u00a03; see 382\nU. S., at 334 (considering impact of the claims allowance process\non \u201caction by the trustee under \u00a760 to recover the preference\u201d); 11\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a796(b) (1964 ed.) (\u00a760(b) of the then-applicable\nBankruptcy Act) (\u201cpreference may be avoided by the trustee if the\ncreditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby \u2026 has, at the time\nwhen the transfer is made, reasonable cause to believe that the\ndebtor is insolvent\u201d). Vickie\u2019s claim, in contrast, is in no way\nderived from or dependent upon bankruptcy law; it is a state tort\naction that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.In light of all the foregoing, we disagree\nwith the dissent that there are no \u201crelevant distinction[s]\u201d\nbetween Pierce\u2019s claim in this case and the claim at issue inLangenkamp.Post, at 14. We see no reason to\ntreat Vickie\u2019s counterclaim any differently from the fraudulent\nconveyance action inGranfinanciera. 492 U. S., at 56.Granfinanciera\u2019s distinction between actions that seek \u201cto\naugment the bankruptcy estate\u201d and those that seek \u201ca pro\u00a0rata\nshare of the bankruptcy res,\u201dibid., reaffirms that\nCongress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceeding may\nhavesomebearing on a bankruptcy case; the question is\nwhether the action at issue stems from the bank-ruptcy itself or\nwould necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process.\nVickie has failed to demonstrate that her counterclaim falls within\none of the \u201climited circumstances\u201d covered by the public rights\nexception, particularly given our conclusion that, \u201ceven with\nrespect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the\n\u2018public rights\u2019 doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art. III\ncourts.\u201dNorthern Pipeline,458 U. S., at 69, n. 23, 77,\nn.\u00a029 (plurality opinion).3Vickie additionally argues that\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s final judgment was constitutional because\nbankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are properly deemed \u201cadjuncts\u201d\nof the district courts. Brief for Petitioner 61\u201364. We rejected a\nsimilar argument inNorthern Pipeline, see 458 U. S., at\n84\u201386 (plurality opinion);id.,at 91 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds true\ntoday.To begin, as explained above, it\nis still the bankruptcy court itself that exercises the essential\nattributes of judicial power over a matter such as Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim. Seesupra,at 20. The new bankruptcy courts,\nlike the old, do not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined\nfactual determinations regarding a particularized area of law\u201d or\nengage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\u201dNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).\nInstead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve \u201c[a]ll\nmatters of fact and law in whatever domains of the law to which\u201d\nthe parties\u2019 counterclaims might lead.Id.,at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).In addition, whereas the adjunct agency inCrowellv.Benson\u201cpossessed only a limited power\nto issue compensation orders \u2026 [that] could be enforced only by\norder of the district court,\u201dNorthern Pipeline, supra,at\n85, a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders\nand judgments\u201d\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to review only if\na party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), 158(a)\u2013(b). It is thus\nno less the case here than it was inNorthern Pipelinethat \u201c[t]he authority\u2014and the respon-sibility\u2014to make an informed,\nfinal determination \u2026 remains with\u201d the bankruptcy judge, not the\ndistrict court. 458 U. S., at 81 (plurality opinion) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Given that authority, a bankruptcy court\ncan no more be deemed a mere \u201cadjunct\u201d of the district court than a\ndistrict court can be deemed such an \u201cadjunct\u201d of the court of\nappeals. We certainly cannot accept the dissent\u2019s notion that\njudges who have the power to enter final, binding orders are the\n\u201cfunctional[\u00a0]\u201d equivalent of \u201claw clerks[\u00a0] and the\nJudiciary\u2019s administrative officials.\u201dPost, at 11. And\neven were we wrong in this regard, that would only confirm that\nsuch judges should not be in the business of entering final\njudgments in the first place.It does not affect our analysis that, as\nVickie notes, bankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed\nby the Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief for\nPetitioner 59. If\u2014as we have concluded\u2014the bankruptcy court itself\nexercises \u201cthe essential attributes of judicial power [that] are\nreserved to Article III courts,\u201dSchor, 478 U. S., at 851\n(internal quotation marks omitted), it does not matter who\nappointed the bankruptcy judge or authorized the judge to render\nfinal judgments in such proceedings. The constitutional bar\nremains. See The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (\u201cPeriodical\nappointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in\nsome way or other, be fatal to [a judge\u2019s] necessary\nindependence\u201d).DFinally, Vickie and heramicipredict as a practical matter that restrictions on a\nbankruptcy court\u2019s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory\ncounterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional\ncosts on the bankruptcy process. See,e.g.,Brief for\nPetitioner 34\u201336, 57\u201358; Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae29\u201330. It goes without saying that \u201cthe fact that a\ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in\nfacilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save\nit if it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201dINSv.Chadha,462\nU. S. 919, 944 (1983).In addition, we are not convinced\nthat the practical consequences of such limitations on the\nauthority of bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as\nsignificant as Vickie and the dissent suggest. Seepost,\nat 16\u201317. The dissent asserts that it is important that\ncounterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s be resolved \u201cin a bankruptcy court,\u201d\nand that, \u201cto be effective, a single tribunal must have broad\nauthority to restructure [debtor-creditor] relations.\u201dPost, at 14, 15 (emphasis deleted). But the framework\nCongress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain\nstate law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by judges\nother than those of the bankruptcy courts. Section 1334(c)(2), for\nexample, requires that bankruptcy courts abstain from hearing\nspecified non-core, state law claims that \u201ccan be timely\nadjudicated[\u00a0] in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction.\u201d\nSection 1334(c)(1) similarly provides that bankruptcy courts may\nabstain from hearing any proceeding, including core matters, \u201cin\nthe interest of comity with State courts or respect for State\nlaw.\u201dAs described above, the current bankruptcy\nsystem also requires the district court to reviewde novoand enter final judgment on any matters that are \u201crelated to\u201d the\nbankruptcy proceedings, \u00a7157(c)(1), and permits the district court\nto withdraw from the bankruptcy court any referred case,\nproceeding, or part thereof, \u00a7157(d). Pierce has not argued that\nthe bankruptcy courts \u201care barred from \u2018hearing\u2019 all counterclaims\u201d\nor proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law on those\nmatters, but rather that it must be the district court that\n\u201cfinally decide[s]\u201d them. Brief for Respondent 61. We do not think\nthe removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from core bankruptcy\njurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the\ncurrent statute; we agree with the United States that the question\npresented here is a \u201cnarrow\u201d one. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae23.If our decision today does not change all that\nmuch, then why the fuss? Is there really a threat to the separation\nof powers where Congress has conferred the judicial power outside\nArticle III only over certain counterclaims in bankruptcy? The\nshort but emphatic answer is yes. A statute may no more lawfully\nchip away at the authority of the Judicial Branch than it may\neliminate it entirely. \u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries\nfrom which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.\u201dReidv.Covert,354 U. S. 1, 39 (1957)\n(plurality opinion). Although \u201c[i]t may be that it is the obnoxious\nthing in its mildest and least repulsive form,\u201d we cannot overlook\nthe intrusion: \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional practices get\ntheir first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and\nslight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\u201dBoydv.United States,116 U. S. 616, 635\n(1886). We cannot compromise the integrity of the system of\nseparated powers and the role of the Judiciary in that system, even\nwith respect to challenges that may seem innocuous at first\nblush.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Article III of the Constitution\nprovides that the judicial power of the United States may be vested\nonly in courts whose judges enjoy the protections set forth in that\nArticle. We conclude today that Congress, in one isolated respect,\nexceeded that limitation in the Bankruptcy Act of 1984. The\nBankruptcy Court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter\na final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved\nin the process of ruling on a creditor\u2019s proof of claim.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Because both Vickie and Pierce passed away\nduring this litigation, the parties in this case are Vickie\u2019s\nestate and Pierce\u2019s estate. We continue to refer to them as\n\u201cVickie\u201d and \u201cPierce.\u201dFootnote 2One judge wrote a separate concurring\nopinion. He concluded that \u201cVickie\u2019s counterclaim \u2026 [wa]s not a\ncore proceeding, so the Texas probate court judgment preceded the\ndistrict court judgment and controls.\u201d 600 F.\u00a03d, at 1065\n(Kleinfeld, J.). The concurring judge also \u201coffer[ed] additional\ngrounds\u201d that he believed required judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor.Ibid.Pierce presses only one of those additional grounds\nhere; it is discussed below, in Part II\u2013C.Footnote 3In full, \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1)\u2013(2) provides:\u201c(1) Bankruptcy judges may hear and determine\nall cases under title 11 and all core proceedings arising under\ntitle 11, or arising in a case under title 11, referred under\nsubsection (a) of this section, and may enter appropriate orders\nand judgments, subject to review under section 158 of this\ntitle.\u201c(2) Core proceedings include, but are not\nlimited to\u2014\u201c(A) matters concerning the administration of\nthe estate;\u201c(B) allowance or disallowance of claims\nagainst the estate or exemptions from property of the estate, and\nestimation of claims or interests for the purposes of confirming a\nplan under chapter 11, 12, or 13 of title 11 but not the\nliquidation or estimation of contingent or unliquidated personal\ninjury tort or wrongful death claims against the estate for\npurposes of distribution in a case under title 11;\u201c(C) counterclaims by the estate against\npersons filing claims against the estate;\u201c(D) orders in respect to obtaining\ncredit;\u201c(E) orders to turn over property of the\nestate;\u201c(F) proceedings to determine, avoid, or\nrecover preferences;\u201c(G) motions to terminate, annul, or modify\nthe automatic stay;\u201c(H) proceedings to determine, avoid, or\nrecover fraudulent conveyances;\u201c(I) determinations as to the dischargeability\nof particular debts;\u201c(J) objections to discharges;\u201c(K) determinations of the validity, extent,\nor priority of liens;\u201c(L) confirmations of plans;\u201c(M) orders approving the use or lease of\nproperty, including the use of cash collateral;\u201c(N) orders approving the sale of property\nother than property resulting from claims brought by the estate\nagainst persons who have not filed claims against the estate;\u201c(O) other proceedings affecting the\nliquidation of the assets of the estate or the adjustment of the\ndebtor-creditor or the equity security holder relationship, except\npersonal injury tort or wrongful death claims; and\u201c(P) recognition of foreign proceedings and\nother matters under chapter 15 of title 11.\u201dFootnote 4Although Pierce suggests that consideration\nof \u201cthe 157(b)(5) issue\u201d would facilitate an \u201ceasy\u201d resolution of\nthe case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348, he is mistaken. Had Pierce\npreserved his argument under that provision, we would have been\nconfronted with several questions on which there is little\nconsensus or precedent. Those issues include: (1) the scope of the\nphrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d\u2014a question over which there is at\nleast a three-way divide, seeIn\u00a0re Arnold, 407\nB.\u00a0R. 849, 851\u2013853 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2009); (2) whether, as\nVickie argued in the Court of Appeals, the requirement that a\npersonal injury tort claim be \u201ctried\u201d in the district court\nnonetheless permits the bankruptcy court to resolve the claim short\nof trial, see Appellee\u2019s/Cross-Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Brief in\nNo.\u00a002\u201356002 etc. (CA9), p.\u00a024; see alsoIn\u00a0re\nDow Corning Corp., 215 B.\u00a0R. 346, 349\u2013351 (Bkrtcy.

S. 500, 514 (2006) (\u201cwhen a\ncourt grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal\nclaim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71367, over\npendent state-law claims\u201d). We express no opinion on any of these\nissues and simply note that the \u00a7157(b)(5) question is not as\nstraightforward as Pierce would have it.Footnote 5The dissent is thus wrong in suggesting that\nless than a full Court agreed on the points pertinent to this case.Post,at 2 (opinion of Breyer, J.).Footnote 6Although the Court inCrowellwent\non to decide that the facts of the private dispute before it could\nbe determined by a non-Article III tribunal in the first instance,\nsubject to judicial review, the Court did so only after observing\nthat the administrative adjudicator had only limited authority to\nmake specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations\nregarding a particularized area of law and to issue orders that\ncould be enforced only by action of the District Court. 285 U. S.,\nat 38, 44\u201345, 54; seeNorthern Pipeline Constr. Co.v.Marathon Pipe Line Co.,458 U. S. 50, 78 (1982) (plurality\nopinion). In other words, the agency inCrowellfunctioned\nas a true \u201cadjunct\u201d of the District Court. That is not the case\nhere. Seeinfra, at 34\u201336.Although the dissent suggests that we understate the import ofCrowellin this regard, the dissent itself\nrecognizes\u2014repeatedly\u2014thatCrowellby its terms addresses\nthe determination offactsoutside Article III. Seepost, at 4 (Crowell\u201cupheld Congress\u2019 delegation\nof primary factfinding authority to the agency\u201d);post,at\n12 (quotingCrowell, 285 U. S., at 51, for the proposition\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018there is no requirement that, in order to maintain the\nessential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations of\nfact in constitutional courts shall be made by judges\u2019\u00a0\u201d).Crowellmay well have additional significance in the\ncontext of expert administrative agencies that oversee particular\nsubstantive federal regimes, but we have no occasion to and do not\naddress those issues today. Seeinfra,at 29. The United\nStates apparently agrees that any broader significance ofCrowellis not pertinent in this case, citing toCrowellin its brief only once, in the last footnote,\nagain for the limited proposition discussed above.

S., at 56, n.\u00a011. Our conclusion was\nthat, \u201ceven if one accepts this thesis,\u201d Congress could not\nconstitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent conveyance\naction to a non-Article III court.Ibid.Because neither\nparty asks us to reconsider the public rights framework for\nbankruptcy, we follow the same approach here.Footnote 8Contrary to the claims of the dissent, seepost,at 12\u201313, Pierce did not have another forum in which\nto pursue his claim to recover from Vickie\u2019s pre-bankruptcy assets,\nrather than take his chances with whatever funds might remain after\nthe Title 11 proceedings. Creditors who possess claims that do not\nsatisfy the requirements for nondischargeability under 11 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7523 have no choice but to file their claims in\nbankruptcy proceedings if they want to pursue the claims at all.\nThat is why, as we recognized inGranfinanciera, the\nnotion of \u201cconsent\u201d does not apply in bankruptcy proceedings as it\nmight in other contexts.",
