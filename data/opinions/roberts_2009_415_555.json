S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-608UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.RANDY EDWARD\nHAYESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit[February 24, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Scalia joins, dissenting.A person convicted of a\n\u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is prohibited from\npossessing a firearm. 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The question\nbefore the Court is whether the definition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) includes misdemeanor offenses\nwith no domestic-relationship element.Section 921(a)(33)(A) provides:\u201c[T]he term \u2018misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u2019 means an offense that\u2014\u201c(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or\nTribal law; and\u201c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted\nuse of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\ncommitted by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the\nvictim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common,\nby a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the\nvictim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly\nsituated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.\u201d (Footnote\nomitted.)The majority would read the\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in clause (ii) to modify the word \u201coffense\u201d\nin the opening clause of subparagraph (A), leapfrogging the word\n\u201celement\u201d at the outset of clause (ii). That reading does not\nrequire the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an\nelement of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted\nunder generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to\ndomestic violence would therefore be subject to prosecution under\n\u00a7922(g)(9).The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d modifies the immediately preceding phrase: \u201cthe use\nor attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a\ndeadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A); 482 F.\u00a03d 749, 753\u2013754 (CA4\n2007). Read that way, a domestic relationship is an element of the\nprior offense.That seems to be the most natural reading\nright off the bat. The term at issue is \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d That is a defined term\u2014so the definition\ncertainly must be parsed\u2014but it would be at least surprising to\nfind from that parsing that a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d need not by its terms have anything to do with domestic\nviolence.1. The grammatical rule of the last antecedent\nindicates that the domestic relationship is a required element of\nthe predicate offense. That rule instructs that \u201ca limiting clause\nor phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the\nnoun or phrase that it immediately follows.\u201dBarnhartv.Thomas,540\nU. S. 20, 26 (2003). Pursuant to that rule, the \u201ccommitted by\u201d\nphrase in clause (ii) is best read to modify the preceding phrase\n\u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use\nof a deadly weapon.\u201d See 482 F.\u00a03d, at 754\u2013755. By not\nfollowing the usual grammatical rule, the majority\u2019s reading\nrequires jumping over two line breaks, clause (i), a semicolon, and\nthe first portion of clause (ii) to reach the more distant\nantecedent (\u201coffense\u201d). Due to the floating \u201cthat\u201d after \u201coffense,\u201d\nif \u201ccommitted by\u201d modified \u201coffense\u201d the text would read \u201coffense\nthat committed by.\u201dThe majority counters that people do not\nordinarily say someone \u201ccommit[s]\u201d a \u201cuse\u201d of force. Seeante, at 6. True enough, but only because \u201cuse\u201d of force\nis a term that encompasses a variety of conduct, which if listed\nseparately would not pose the objection the majority raises\n(e.g.,commits a battery, robbery, or kidnaping). There is\nno reason to believe that the reasonable drafting decision to\ninsert \u201cuse\u201d of force rather than coming up with a laundry list of\noffenses was meant to alter the meaning of the statute.The majority also relies on Congress\u2019s use of\nthe word \u201celement\u201d in the singular. From that, the majority infers\nthat Congress intended to describe only one required element\u2014the\nuse of force.Ante, at 5. In its view, Congress would have\nused the plural \u201celements\u201d if it meant to encompass both the use of\nforce and the offender\u2019s relationship with the victim.Ibid.That argument is contrary to the Dictionary\nAct, which specifies that unless the context indicates otherwise,\n\u201cwords importing the singular include and apply to several persons,\nparties, or things.\u201d 1 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71; seeRowlandv.California Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council,506 U. S. 194,\n200 (1993). More significantly, reading \u201celement\u201d as limited to the\nsingular does not resolve what that element is. SeeUnited\nStatesv. Barnes, 295 F.\u00a03d 1354, 1369 (CADC\n2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting). A single element often contains\nmultiple components. In the very provision at issue, the\n\u201cthreatened use of a deadly weapon\u201d includes three concepts: (1)\nthe threatened use (2) of a weapon (3) that is deadly.In other statutes, Congress has used the word\n\u201celement\u201d in the singular to refer to the use of force and its\nobject. See,e.g.,18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a) (defining\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense that has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson or property of another\u201d). The majority finds it\n\u201cunsurprising\u201d that Congress would have chosen to combine the mode\nof aggression and its object in a \u201csingle, undifferentiated\nelement.\u201dAnte, at 5, n. 4. It asserts, however, that\nCongress would not have so joined the use of force and the\noffender\u2019s relationship with the victim, because those requirements\n\u201care not readily conceptualized as a single element.\u201dIbid. That distinction is elusive; both 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a716(a) and the provision at issue here contain as distinct\ncomponents the act (use of force) and the target (person or\nproperty in the former case, domestic relationship victim in the\nlatter).The majority also points out that interpreting\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d to modify the \u201cuse\u201d of force would render the word\n\u201ccommitted\u201d superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d to modify \u201coffense\u201d has its own flaws. All this goes\nto show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under\neither reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its\nview, the statutory language reflects \u201cless-than-meticulous\ndrafting\u201d and \u201csyntactical awkwardness,\u201d and \u201cis not a model of the\ncareful drafter\u2019s art.\u201dAnte,at 6, 12, 13. I am willing\nto acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude\nfrom such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least\nambiguous.2. That brings us to the structure of the\nstatute. The most natural reading of the statute, as it is laid\nout, is that the underlying misdemeanor must have as an element the\nuse of force committed by a person in a domestic relationship with\nthe victim. The definition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d is twice qualified: first, by the relative clause \u201cis a\nmisdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law\u201d; and second by the\nrelative clause \u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of\nphysical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed\nby [a person in a specified domestic relationship with the\nvictim].\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (footnote omitted). The fact that Congress\nincluded the domestic relationship language in the clause of the\nstatute designating the element of the predicate offense strongly\nsuggests that it is in fact part of the required element.The majority\u2019s contrary reading requires\nrestructuring the statute and adding words. The majority first must\nplace the \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in its own clause\u2014set off by a line\nbreak, a semicolon, or \u201c(iii)\u201d\u2014to indicate that \u201ccommitted by\u201d\nrefers all the way back to \u201coffense.\u201d And, as noted, because the\nword \u201cthat\u201d appears at the end of subparagraph (A), the statute\nwould then read \u201can offense that committed by.\u201d To arrive at its\nreading, the majority must ignore the floating \u201cthat\u201d or add \u201cand\nis\u201d before \u201ccommitted by.\u201dThe Government would define \u201cmisdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence\u201d as \u201can offense, committed by a person with a\ndomestic relationship with the victim, that is a misdemeanor and\nhas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or\nthe threatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d Brief for United States 13;\nsee also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139. That reading also requires\nrearranging the statute. The \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase would have to be\nsevered from clause (ii) and moved up to appear after the word\n\u201coffense\u201d in subparagraph (A). Changing and rearranging the wording\nas the Government does to explain what the actual words mean is, in\nany event, not a compelling line of argument.The majority attempts to diminish the\nmagnitude of these alterations by stating that the lawmakers might\nhave better conveyed their intent by setting off the \u201ccommitted by\u201d\nphrase with \u201ca semicolon\u201d or \u201ca line break.\u201dAnte, at 6.\nBut those are not insignificant revisions; they alter the structure\nof the statute, and we have recognized that structure is often\ncritical in resolving verbal ambiguity. SeeCastillov.United States,530 U. S. 120, 124\n(2000) (\u201cThe statute\u2019s structure clarifies any ambiguity inherent\nin its literal language\u201d). I therefore respectfully disagree with\nthe majority that \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is most\nsensibly read as including misdemeanor offenses without a\ndomestic-relationship element.3. Moving beyond text and structure, the\nmajority recognizes that there is \u201clittle . . . drafting history,\u201dante, at 13, but gamely trots out what there is: a\nstatement on the floor of the Senate by the bill\u2019s sponsor, seeante, at 12. Such tidbits do not amount to much. SeeConsumer Product Safety Comm\u2019nv.GTE Sylvania,\nInc.,447 U. S.\n102, 118 (1980). This is especially true here where the\nstatement was delivered the day the legislation was passed andafterthe House of Representatives had passed the\npertinent provision. SeeExxon Mobil Corp.v.Allapattah Services, Inc.,545 U. S. 546, 568\n(2005); see also Brief for Respondent 33. The majority nonetheless\nlooks to the floor statement because \u201cthe legislative record is\notherwise \u2018absolutely silent.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 12. But\nthat is no reason to accord the statement significance: We dismiss\nthe value of such statements due to their inherent flaws as guides\nto legislative intent, flaws that persist (and indeed may be\namplified) in the absence of other indicia of intent.The majority also finds it \u201chighly improbable\nthat Congress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm possession ban\nonly to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws\nrendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.\u201dAnte, at 11. In its view, construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude\npersons convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would\n\u201cfrustrate Congress\u2019 manifest purpose,\u201dante,at 10, of\nkeeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Seeante, at 10 (quoting statement of Sen. Lautenberg, 142\nCong. Rec. 22985 (1996)).Invoking thesponsor\u2019sobjective asCongress\u2019smanifest purpose, however, \u201cignores the\ncomplexity of the problems Congress is called upon to address and\nthe dynamics of legislative action.\u201dBoard of Governors,\nFRSv.Dimension Financial Corp.,474 U. S. 361, 373\u2013374\n(1986). Legislative enactments are the result of negotiations\nbetween competing interests; \u201cthe final language of the legislation\nmay reflect hard-fought compromises.\u201dId., at 374. Even if\nthere were sufficient sentiment to extend the gun ban, individual\nlegislators might have disagreed on the appropriate reach of the\nnew provision. Seeibid. Some members might well have been\nwilling to extend the ban beyond individuals convicted of felonies,\nbut only if the predicate misdemeanor by its terms was addressed to\ndomestic violence.4. The majority\u2019s approach will entail\nsignificant problems in application. Under the interpretation\nadopted by the court below, it is easy to determine whether an\nindividual is covered by the gun ban: Simply look to the record of\nthe prior conviction. Under the majority\u2019s approach, on the other\nhand, it will often be necessary to go beyond the fact of\nconviction and \u201cengage in an elaborate factfinding process\nregarding the defendant\u2019s prior offens[e],\u201dTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575, 601\n(1990), to determine whether it happened to involve domestic\nviolence.That is one reason we adopted a categorical\napproach to predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1), \u201clooking only to the statutory\ndefinitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.\u201dTaylor, supra, at 600; seeShepardv.United States,544 U. S. 13, 19 (2005)\n(Court considered \u201cpredicate offens[e] in terms not of prior\nconduct but of prior \u2018convictions\u2019 and the \u2018element[s]\u2019 of\ncrimes\u201d). As we warned inTaylorand reaffirmed inShepard, \u201cthe practical difficulties and potential\nunfairness of a factual approach are daunting.\u201dTaylor,supra, at 601; seeShepard,supra, at\n20. Those same concerns are implicated here, given that the\nmajority would require juries and courts to look at the particular\nfacts of a prior conviction to determine whether it happened to\ninvolve domestic violence, rather than simply looking to the\nelements of the predicate offense. Seeante, at 4-5.5. Taking a fair view, the text of\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A) is ambiguous, the structure leans in the defendant\u2019s\nfavor, the purpose leans in the Government\u2019s favor, and the\nlegislative history does not amount to much. This is a textbook\ncase for application of the rule of lenity.\u201cBecause construction of a criminal statute\nmust be guided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that\nlegislative history or statutory policies will support a\nconstruction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by\nthe text.\u201dCrandonv.United States,494 U. S. 152, 160\n(1990). It cannot fairly be said here that the text \u201cclearly\nwarrants\u201d the counterintuitive conclusion that a \u201ccrime of domestic\nviolence\u201d need not have domestic violence as an element. That\nleaves the majority\u2019s arguments about legislative history and\nstatutory purpose. This is not the \u201crare\u201d case in which such\ngrounds provide \u201cfair warning,\u201d especially given that there is\nnothing wrong with the conduct punished\u2014possessing a firearm\u2014if the\nprior misdemeanor is not covered by the statute.If the rule of lenity means anything, it is\nthat an individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a\n50-state survey or comb through obscure legislative history. Ten\nyears in jail is too much to hinge on the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of\nstatutory meaning pursued by the majority.",
