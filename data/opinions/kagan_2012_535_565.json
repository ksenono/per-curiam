    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 10\u2013704_________________CURT MESSERSCHMIDT, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.BRENDA MILLENDER, as executor of the ESTATE OF AUGUSTA\nMILLENDER, DECEASED, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[February 22, 2012]Justice Kagan, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part.Both the Court and the dissent view this case as\nan all-or-nothing affair: The Court awards immunity across the\nboard to Messerschmidt and his colleagues, while the dissent would\ngrant them none at all. I think the right answer lies in between,\nalthough the Court makes the more far-reaching error.I agree with the Court that a reasonably\ncompetent police officer could have thought this warrant valid in\nauthorizing a search for all firearms and related items. Seeante, at 11\u201312. The warrant application recounted that a\nknown gang member had used a sawed-off shotgun\u2014an illegal weapon\nunder California law, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a733215 (West 2012\nCum. Supp.)\u2014to try to kill another person. See App. 56\u201357, 59.\nPerhaps gang ties plus possession of an unlawful gun plus use of\nthat gun to commit a violent assault do not add up to what was\nneeded for this search: probable cause to believe that Bowen had\nadditional illegal firearms (or legal firearms that he intended to\nuse to violate the law) at the place he was staying. But because\nour and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions leave that conclusion\ndebatable, a reasonable police officer could have found the warrant\nadequately supported by \u201cindicia of probable cause.\u201dMalleyv.Briggs,475 U.S.\n335, 345 (1986). So Messerschmidt and his fellow officers\nshould receive qualified immunity for their search for\nfirearms.The Court, however, goes astray when it holds\nthat a reasonable officer could have thought the warrant valid in\napproving a search for evidence of \u201cstreet gang membership,\u201d App.\n52. Membership in even the worst gang does not violate California\nlaw, so the officers could not search for gang paraphernalia just\nto establish Bowen\u2019s ties to the Crips. Instead, the police needed\nprobable cause to believe that such items would provide evidence of\nan actual crime\u2014and as the Court acknowledges, seeante, at\n12\u201314, the only crime mentioned in the warrant application was the\nassault on Kelly. The problem for the Court is that nothing in the\napplication supports a link between Bowen\u2019s gang membership and\nthat shooting. Contra the Court\u2019s elaborate theory-spinning, seeante, at 12\u201316, Messerschmidt\u2019s affidavit in fact\ncharacterized the violent assault only as a domestic dispute, not\nas a gang-related one, see App. 55 (describing the crime as a\n\u201cspousal assault and an assault with a deadly weapon\u201d). And that\ndescription is consistent with the most natural understanding of\nthe events. The warrant application thus had a hole at its very\ncenter: It lacked any explanation of how gang items would (or even\nmight) provide evidence of the domestic assault the police were\ninvestigating.To fill this vacuum, the Court proposes an\nalternative, but similarly inadequate justification\u2014that gang\nparaphernalia could have demonstrated Bowen\u2019s connection to the\nMillender residence and to any evidence of the assault found there.\nThe dissent rightly notes one difficulty with this argument: The\ndiscovery of gang items would not have established that Bowen was\nstaying at the house, given that several other gang members\nregularly did so. Seepost, at 8\u20139 (opinion of Sotomayor,\nJ.). And even setting that issue aside, the Court\u2019s reasoning\nproves far too much: It would sanction equally well a search foranyof Bowen\u2019s possessions on the premises\u2014a result impos-\nsible to square with the Fourth Amendment. See,e.g.,\nAndresenv.Maryland,427 U.S.\n463, 480 (1976) (disapproving \u201c\u00a0\u2018a general, exploratory\nrummaging in a person\u2019s belongings\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingCoolidgev.New Hampshire,403 U.S.\n443, 467 (1971))). In authorizing a search for all gang-related\nitems, the warrant far outstripped the officers\u2019 probable cause.\nBecause a reasonable officer would have recognized that defect, I\nwould not award qualified immunity to Messerschmidt and his\ncolleagues for this aspect of their search.Still more fundamentally, the Court errs in\nscolding the Court of Appeals for failing to give \u201cweight to the\nfact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved by the\nofficers\u2019 superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral\nmagistrate.\u201dAnte, at 17. As the dissent points out, seepost, at 13\u201315, this Court\u2019s holding inMalleyis to\nthe opposite effect: An officer isnot\u201centitled to rely on\nthe judgment of a judicial officer in finding that probable cause\nexists and hence issuing the warrant.\u201d 475 U.\u00a0S., at 345.Malleymade clear that qualified immunity turned on the\nofficer\u2019s own \u201cprofessional judgment,\u201d considered separately from\nthe mistake of the magistrate.Id.,at 346; seeibid., n.\u00a09 (\u201cThe officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot excuse\nhis own default by pointing to the greater incompetence of the\nmagistrate\u201d);id.,at 350 (Powell, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (objecting to the Court\u2019s decision to \u201cgive\nlittle evidentiary weight to the finding of probable cause by a\nmagistrate\u201d). And what we said inMalleyabout a\nmagistrate\u2019s authorization applies still more strongly to the\napproval of other police officers or state attorneys. All those\nindividuals, as the Court puts it, are \u201cpart of the prosecution\nteam.\u201dAnte, at 18. To make their views relevant is to\nenable those teammates (whether acting in good or bad faith) to\nconfer immunity on each other for unreasonable conduct\u2014like\napplying for a warrant without anything resembling probable\ncause.For these reasons, I would reverse in part and\naffirm in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would\nremand this case for further proceedings.",
