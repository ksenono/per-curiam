RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 29, 2006]Justice Alito, with whom Justices\nScalia and Thomas join in Parts I\u2013III, dissenting.For the reasons set out in\nJustice Scalia\u2019s dissent, which I join, I would hold that we lack\njurisdiction. On the merits, I join Justice Thomas\u2019 dissent with\nthe exception of Parts I, II\u2013C\u20131, and III\u2013B\u20132, which concern\nmatters that I find unnecessary to reach. I add the following\ncomments to provide a further explanation of my reasons for\ndisagreeing with the holding of the Court.IThe holding of the Court, as I\nunderstand it, rests on the following reasoning. A military\ncommission is lawful only if it is authorized by 10 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7821; this provision permits the use of a commission to try\n\u201coffenders or offenses\u201d that \u201cby statute or by the law of war may\nbe tried by\u201d such a commission; because no statute provides that an\noffender such as petitioner or an offense such as the one with\nwhich he is charged may be tried by a military commission, he may\nbe tried by military commission only if the trial is authorized by\n\u201cthe law of war\u201d; the Geneva Conventions are part of the law of\nwar; and Common Article 3 of the Conventions prohibits petitioner\u2019s\ntrial because the commission before which he would be tried is not\n\u201ca regularly constituted court,\u201d Third Geneva Convention, Art. 3,\n\u00b61(d),Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug.\n12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S.\u00a0T. 3316, 3320,\nT.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 3364. I disagree with this holding\nbecause petitioner\u2019s commission is \u201ca regularly constituted\ncourt.\u201dCommon Article 3 provides as\nfollows:\u201cIn the case of armed conflict not of an\ninternational character occurring in the territory of one of the\nHigh Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound\nto apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:\u201c(1)\u2002\u2026 [T]he following acts are and shall\nremain prohibited \u2026 :\u201c(d)\u2002[T]he passing of sentences and the\ncarrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced bya regularly constituted courtaffording all the judicial\nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized\npeoples.\u201dId.,at 3318\u20133320 (emphasis added).Common Article 3 thus imposes\nthree requirements. Sentences may be imposed only by (1) a \u201ccourt\u201d\n(2) that is \u201cregularly constituted\u201d and (3) that affords \u201call the\njudicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by\ncivilized peoples.\u201dId.,at 3320.I see no need here to comment extensively on\nthe meaning of the first and third requirements. The first\nrequirement is largely self-explanatory, and, with respect to the\nthird, I note only that on its face it imposes a uniform\ninternational standard that does not vary from signatory to\nsignatory.The second element (\u201cregularly constituted\u201d)\nis the one on which the Court relies, and I interpret this element\nto require that the court be appointed or established in accordance\nwith the appointing country\u2019s domestic law. I agree with the Court,\nseeante, at 69, n. 64, that, as used in Common Article 3,\nthe term \u201cregularly\u201d is synonymous with \u201cproperly.\u201d The term\n\u201cconstitute\u201d means \u201cappoint,\u201d \u201cset up,\u201d or \u201cestablish,\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 486 (1961), and therefore\n\u201cregularly constituted\u201d means properly appointed, set up, or\nestablished. Our cases repeatedly use the phrases \u201cregularly\nconstituted\u201d and \u201cproperly constituted\u201d in this sense. See,e.g., Hamdiv.Rumsfeld,542 U. S. 507, 538\n(2004) (plurality opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.);Nguyenv.United States,539 U. S. 69, 83 (2003);Ryderv.United States,515 U. S. 177, 187\n(1995);Williamsv.Bruffy,96 U. S. 176, 185\n(1878).In order to determine whether a court has been\nproperly appointed, set up, or established, it is necessary to\nrefer to a body of law that governs such matters. I interpret\nCommon Article 3 as looking to the domestic law of the appointing\ncountry because I am not aware of any international law standard\nregarding the way in which such a court must be appointed, set up,\nor established, and because different countries with different\ngovernment structures handle this matter differently. Accordingly,\n\u201ca regularly constituted court\u201d is a court that has been appointed,\nset up, or established in accordance with the domestic law of the\nappointing country.IIIn contrast to this\ninterpretation, the opinions supporting the judgment today hold\nthat the military commission before which petitioner would be tried\nis not \u201ca regularly constituted court\u201d (a) because \u201cno evident\npractical need explains\u201d why its \u201cstructure and composition \u2026\ndeviate from conventional court-martial standards,\u201dante,\nat 11 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part); see alsoante, at\n69\u201370 (Opinion of the Court); and (b) because, contrary to 10 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7836(b), the procedures specified for use in the\nproceeding before the military commission impermissibly differ from\nthose provided under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\nfor use by courts-martial,ante, at 52\u201362 (Opinion of the\nCourt);ante, at 16\u201318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part).\nI do not believe that either of these grounds is sound.AI see no basis for the Court\u2019s\nholding that a military commission cannot be regarded as \u201ca\nregularly constituted court\u201d unless it is similar in structure and\ncomposition to a regular military court or unless there is an\n\u201cevident practical need\u201d for the divergence. There is no reason why\na court that differs in structure or composition from an ordinary\nmilitary court must be viewed as having been improperly\nconstituted. Tribunals that vary significantly in structure,\ncomposition, and procedures may all be \u201cregularly\u201d or \u201cproperly\u201d\nconstituted. Consider, for example, a municipal court, a state\ntrial court of general jurisdiction, an Article I federal trial\ncourt, a federal district court, and an international court, such\nas the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\nAlthough these courts are \u201cdifferently constituted\u201d and differ\nsubstantially in many other respects, they are all \u201cregularly\nconstituted.\u201dIf Common Article 3 had been\nmeant to require trial before a country\u2019s military courts or courts\nthat are similar in structure and composition, the drafters almost\ncertainly would have used language that expresses that thought more\ndirectly. Other provisions of the Convention Relative to the\nTreatment of Prisoners of War refer expressly to the ordinary\nmilitary courts and expressly prescribe the \u201cuniformity principle\u201d\nthat Justice Kennedy sees in Common Article 3, seeante,\nat 8\u20139. Article 84 provides that \u201c[a] prisoner of war shall be\ntried only by a military court, unless the existing laws of the\nDetaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member\nof the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the\nparticular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner\nof war.\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3382. Article 87 states that \u201c[p]risoners\nof war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts\nof the Detaining Power to any penalties except those provided for\nin respect of members of the armed forces of the said Power who\nhave committed the same acts.\u201dId., at 3384. Similarly,\nArticle 66 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of\nCivilian Persons in Time of War\u2014a provision to which the Court\nlooks for guidance in interpreting Common Article 3, seeanteat 69\u2014expressly provides that civilians charged with\ncommitting crimes in occupied territory may be handed over by the\noccupying power \u201cto its properly constituted, non-political\nmilitary courts, on condition that the said courts sit in the\noccupied country.\u201d 6 U. S. T. 3516, 3558\u20133560,\nT.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 3365. If Common Article 3 had been\nmeant to incorporate a \u201cuniformity principle,\u201d it presumably would\nhave used language like that employed in the provisions noted\nabove. For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that the military commission at issue here is not a\n\u201cregularly constituted court\u201d because its structure and composition\ndiffer from those of a court-martial.Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, seeante, at 69, the commentary on Article 66 of Fourth Geneva\nConvention does not undermine this conclusion. As noted, Article 66\npermits an occupying power to try civilians in its \u201cproperly\nconstituted, non-political military courts,\u201d 6 U. S.\u00a0T., at\n3558. The commentary on this provision states:\u201cThe courts are to be \u2018regularly constituted\u2019. This\nwording definitely excludes all special tribunals. It is the\nordinary military courts of the Occupying Power which will be\ncompetent.\u201d 4 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva\nConvention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time\nof War 340 (1958) (hereinafter GCIV Commentary).The Court states that this\ncommentary \u201cdefines \u2018\u00a0\u201cregularly constituted\u201d\u00a0\u2019 tribunals\nto include \u2018ordinary military courts\u2019 and \u2018definitely exclud[e] all\nspecial tribunals.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 69 (alteration in\noriginal). This much is clear from the commentary itself. Yet the\nmere statement that a military courtisa regularly\nconstituted tribunal is of no help in addressing petitioner\u2019s claim\nthat his commissionis notsuch a tribunal. As for the\ncommentary\u2019s mention of \u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d it is doubtful whether\nwe should take this gloss on Article 66\u2014which forbids anoccupying powerfrom tryingciviliansin courts\nset up specially for that purpose\u2014to tell us much about the very\ndifferent context addressed by Common Article 3.But even if Common Article 3 recognizes this\nprohibition on \u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d that prohibition does not cover\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal. If \u201cspecial\u201d means anything in\ncontradistinction to \u201cregular,\u201d it would be in the sense of\n\u201cspecial\u201d as \u201crelating to a single thing,\u201d and \u201cregular\u201d as\n\u201cuniform in course, practice, or occurrence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 2186, 1913. Insofar as respondents propose\nto conduct the tribunals according to the procedures of Military\nCommission Order No. 1 and orders promulgated thereunder\u2014and nobody\nhas suggested respondents intend otherwise\u2014then it seems that\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal, like the hundreds of others respondents\npropose to conduct, is very much regular and not at all\nspecial.BI also disagree with the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that petitioner\u2019s military commission is \u201cillegal,\u201dante, at 62, because its procedures allegedly do not\ncomply with 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7836. Even if \u00a7836(b), unlike Common\nArticle 3, does impose at least a limited uniformity requirement\namongst the tribunals contemplated by the UCMJ, but seeante, at 35 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and even if it is\nassumed for the sake of argument that some of the procedures\nspecified in Military Commission Order No. 1 impermissibly deviate\nfrom court-martial procedures, it does not follow that the military\ncommissions created by that order are not \u201cregularly constituted\u201d\nor that trying petitioner before such a commission would be\ninconsistent with the law of war. If Congress enacted a statute\nrequiring the federal district courts to follow a procedure that is\nunconstitutional, the statute would be invalid, but the district\ncourts would not. Likewise, if some of the procedures that may be\nused in military commission proceedings are improper, the\nappropriate remedy is to proscribe the use of those particular\nprocedures, not to outlaw the commissions. I see no justification\nfor striking down the entire commission structure simply because it\nis possible that petitioner\u2019s trial might involve the use of some\nprocedure that is improper.IIIReturning to the three elements\nof Common Article 3\u2014(1) a court, (2) that is appointed, set up, and\nestablished in compliance with domestic law, and (3) that respects\nuniversally recognized fundamental rights\u2014I conclude that all of\nthese elements are satisfied in this case.AFirst, the commissions qualify as\ncourts.Second, the commissions were\nappointed, set up, and established pursuant to an order of the\nPresident, just like the commission inEx parte Quirin,317 U. S. 1(1942), and the Court acknowledges thatQuirinrecognized\nthat the statutory predecessor of 10 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7821 \u201cpreserved\u201d\nthe President\u2019s power \u201cto convene military commissions,\u201dante, at 29. Although Justice Kennedy concludes that \u201can\nacceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary\nto render a commission \u2018regularly constituted\u2019 by the standards of\nour Nation\u2019s system of justice,\u201danteat 9\u201310, he offers\nno support for this proposition (which in any event seems to be\nmore about fairness or integrity than regularity). The commission\ninQuirinwas certainly no more independent from the\nExecutive than the commissions at issue here, and 10 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a7821 and 836 do not speak to this issue.[Footnote 1]Finally, the commission\nprocedures, taken as a whole, and including the availability of\nreview by a United States Court of Appeals and by this\nCourt,do not provide a basis for deeming the commissions\nto be illegitimate. The Court questions the following two\nprocedural rules: the rule allowing the Secretary of Defense to\nchange the governing rules \u201c\u00a0\u2018from time to time\u2019\u00a0\u201d (which\ndoes not rule out mid-trial changes), seeante, at 70, n.\n65 (Opinion of the Court);ante, at 9\u201310 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring in part), and the rule that permits the admission of any\nevidence that would have \u201c\u00a0\u2018probative value to a reasonable\nperson\u2019\u00a0\u201d (which departs from our legal system\u2019s usual rules\nof evidence), seeante, at 51, 60 (Opinion of the Court);ante, at 16\u201318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part).[Footnote 2] Neither of these two rules\nundermines the legitimacy of the commissions.Surely the entire commission\nstructure cannot be stricken merely because it is possible that the\ngoverning rules might be changed during the course of one or more\nproceedings.Ifa change is made and applied during the\ncourse of an ongoing proceeding andifthe accused is\nfound guilty, the validity of that procedure can be considered in\nthe review proceeding for that case. After all, not every midtrial\nchange will be prejudicial. A midtrial change might amend the\ngoverning rules in a way that is inconsequential or actually\nfavorable to the accused.As for the standard for the admission of\nevidence at commission proceedings, the Court does not suggest that\nthis rule violates the international standard incorporated into\nCommon Article 3 (\u201cthe judicial guarantees which are recognized as\nindispensable by civilized peoples,\u201d 6 U. S.\u00a0T., at 3320).\nRules of evidence differ from country to country, and much of the\nworld does not follow aspects of our evidence rules, such as the\ngeneral prohibition against the admission of hearsay. See,e.g.,Blumenthal, Shedding Some Light on Calls for Hearsay\nReform: Civil Law Hearsay Rules in Historical and Modern\nPerspective, 13 Pace Int\u2019l L.\u00a0Rev. 93, 96\u2013101 (2001). If a\nparticular accused claims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the\nadmission of particular evidence, that claim can be reviewed in the\nreview proceeding for that case. It makes no sense to strike down\nthe entire commission structure based on speculation that some\nevidence might be improperly admitted in some future case.In sum, I believe that Common Article 3 is\nsatisfied here because the military commissions (1) qualify as\ncourts, (2) that were appointed and established in accordance with\ndomestic law, and (3) any procedural improprieties that might occur\nin particular cases can be reviewed in those cases.BThe commentary on Common Article\n3 supports this interpretation. The commentary on Common Article 3,\n\u00b61(d), in its entirety states:\u201c[A]lthough [sentences and executions without a\nproper trial] were common practice until quite recently, they are\nnevertheless shocking to the civilized mind\u2026\u00a0. Sentences and\nexecutions without previous trial are too open to error. \u2018Summary\njustice\u2019 may be effective on account of the fear it arouses \u2026 , but\nit adds too many further innocent victims to all the other innocent\nvictims of the conflict. All civilized nations surround the\nadministration of justice with safeguards aimed at eliminating the\npossibility of judicial errors. The Convention has rightly\nproclaimed that it is essential to do this even in time of war.We must be very clear about one point: it is only \u2018summary\u2019\njustice which it is intended to prohibit.No sort of immunity\nis given to anyone under this provision. There is nothing in it to\nprevent a person presumed to be guilty from being arrested and so\nplaced in a position where he can do no further harm; and it leaves\nintact the right of the State to prosecute, sentence and punish\naccording to the law.\u201d GCIV Commentary 39 (emphasis added).It seems clear that the\ncommissions at issue here meet this standard. Whatever else may be\nsaid about the system that was created by Military Commission Order\nNo. 1 and augmented by the Detainee Treatment Act, \u00a71005(e)(1), 119\nStat. 2742, this system\u2014which features formal trial procedures,\nmultiple levels of administrative review, and the opportunity for\nreview by a United States Court of Appeals and by this Court\u2014does\nnot dispense \u201csummary justice.\u201d*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote 1Section 821 looks to the \u201claw of war,\u201d not\nseparation of powers issues. And \u00a7836, as Justice Kennedy notes,\nconcerns procedures, not structure, seeante, at 10.Footnote 2The plurality, but not Justice Kennedy,\nsuggests that the commission rules are improper insofar as they\nallow a defendant to be denied access to evidence under some\ncircumstances. See,ante, at 70\u201372. But here too, if this\nprocedure is used in a particular case and the accused is\nconvicted, the validity of this procedure can be challenged in the\nreview proceeding in that case. In that context, both the asserted\nneed for the procedure and its impact on the accused can be\nanalyzed in concrete terms.",
