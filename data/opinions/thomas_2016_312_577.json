I write separately because I have\ncome to doubt whether \u00a71144 is a valid exercise of congressional\npower and whether our approach to ERISA pre-emption is consistent\nwith our broader pre-emption jurisprudence.ISection 1144 contains what may be the most\nexpansive express pre-emption provision in any federal statute.\nSection 1144(a) states: \u201cExcept as provided\u201d in \u00a71144(b) ERISA\n\u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or\nhereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d Under the ordinary\nmeaning of the phrase \u201crelate to,\u201d \u00a71144(a) pre-empts all state\nlaws that \u201c\u00a0\u2018stand in some relation\u2019\u00a0\u201d to, \u201c\u00a0\u2018have\nbearing or concern\u2019\u00a0\u201d on, \u201c\u00a0\u2018pertain\u2019\u00a0\u201d to,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018refer\u2019\u00a0\u201d to, or \u2018\u00a0\u201cbring into association with or\nconnection with\u2019\u00a0\u201d an ERISA plan.Shawv.Delta Air\nLines, Inc., 463 U.\u00a0S. 85 , n.\u00a016 (1983) (quoting\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)). And \u00a71144(b) seemingly\nacknowledges how broadly \u00a71144(a) extends by excepting \u201cgener-ally\napplicable criminal law[s]\u201d and state laws \u201cregulat[ing] insurance,\nbanking, or securities\u201d\u2014but not generally applicable civil\nlaws\u2014from pre-emption. \u00a7\u00a71144(b)(2)(A), (b)(4). Section 1144, in\nsum, \u201cis clearly expansive\u201d\u2014so much so that \u201cone might be excused\nfor wondering, at first blush, whether the words of limitation\n(\u2018insofar as they .\u00a0.\u00a0. relate\u2019) do much limiting.\u201dNew York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield\nPlansv.Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.\u00a0S. 645, 655\n(1995) .Read according to its plain terms, \u00a71144 raises\nconstitutional concerns. \u201c[T]he Supremacy Clause gives \u2018supreme\u2019\nstatus only to those [federal laws] that are \u2018made in\nPursuance\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the Constitution.Wyethv.Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 585 (2009) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting Art. VI, cl. 2). But I question\nwhether any provision of Article I authorizes Congress to prohibit\nStates from applying a host of generally applicable civil laws to\nERISA plans. \u201cThe Constitution requires a distinction between what\nis truly national and what is truly local.\u201dUnited Statesv.Morrison, 529 U.\u00a0S. 598 \u2013618 (2000). If the Federal\nGovernment were \u201cto take over the regulation of entire areas of\ntraditional state concern,\u201d including \u201careas having nothing to do\nwith the regulation of commercial activities,\u201d then \u201cthe boundaries\nbetween the spheres of federal and state authority would blur and\npolitical responsibility would become illusory.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Lopez, 514 U.\u00a0S. 549, 577 (1995)\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). Just because Congress can regulate some\naspects of ERISA plans pursuant to the Commerce Clause does not\nmean that Congress can exempt ERISA plans from state regulations\nthat have nothing to do with interstate commerce. SeeGonzalesv.Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S. 1 \u201360 (2005)\n(Thomas, J., dissenting).IIThis Court used to interpret \u00a71144 according\nto its text. But we became uncomfortable with how much state law\n\u00a71144 would pre-empt if read literally. \u201cIf \u2018relate to\u2019 were taken\nto extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,\u201d we\nexplained, \u201cthen for all practical purposes pre-emption would never\nrun its course.\u201dTravelers,supra, at 655.Rather than addressing the constitutionality of\n\u00a71144, we abandoned efforts to give its text its ordinary meaning.\nInTravelers, we adopted atextual but what we thought to be\n\u201cworkable\u201d standards to construe \u00a71144.Ante,at 6. Thus, to\ndetermine whether a state law impermissibly \u201crelates to\u201d an ERISA\nplan due to some \u201cconnection with\u201d that plan, we now \u201clook both to\nthe objectives of the ERISA statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. as well as to\nthe nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\u201dEgelhoffv.Egelhoff, 532 U.\u00a0S. 141, 147 (2001)\n(citingTravelers; internal quotation marks omitted).We decidedTravelersin 1995. I joined\nthat opinion and have joined others applying the approach we\nadopted inTravelers. But our interpretation of ERISA\u2019s\nexpress pre-emption provision has become increasingly difficult to\nreconcile with our pre-emption jurisprudence.Travelersdeparted from the statutory text, deeming it \u201cunhelpful.\u201d 514\nU.\u00a0S., at 656. But, in other cases involving express\npre-emption provisions, the text has been the beginning and often\nthe end of our analysis.E.g., Chamber of Commerce of United\nStates of Americav.Whiting, 563 U.\u00a0S. 582, 594\n(2011) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018focus[ing] on the plain wording\u2019\u00a0\u201d to define\nthe scope of the Immigration Reform and Control Act\u2019s express\npre-emption clause); see alsoNationalMeatAssn. v.Harris, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___\u2013___\n(2012) (slip op., at 4, 6\u201310) (parsing the text to determine the\nscope of the Federal Meat Inspection Act\u2019s express pre-emption\nclause). We have likewise refused to look to policy limits that are\nnot \u201cremotely discernible in the statutory text.\u201dWhiting,supra,at 599. We have not given a sound basis for departing\nfrom these principles and treating \u00a71144 differently from other\nexpress pre-emption provisions.Travelers\u2019approach to ERISA pre-emption\nalso does not avoid constitutional concerns. We have continued to\ninterpret \u00a71144 as pre-empting \u201csubstantial areas of traditional\nstate regulation\u201d and \u201cpre-empt[ing] a state law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\neven if the state law exercises a traditional state power.\u201dAnte, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). Until we\nconfront whether Congress had the constitutional authority to\npre-empt such a wide array of state laws in the first place, the\nCourt\u2014and lower courts\u2014will continue to struggle to apply \u00a71144. It\nbehooves us to address whether Article I gives Congress such power\nand whether \u00a71144 may permissibly be read to avoid unconstitutional\nresults.",
