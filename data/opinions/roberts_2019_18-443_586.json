It still does.\nBut putting aside the difficulties of applyingMoorein\nother cases, it is easy to see that the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals misapplied it here. On remand, the court re- peated the\nsame errors that this Court previously condemned\u2014if not quitein\nhaec verba, certainly in substance. The court repeated its\nimproper reliance on the factors articulated inEx\u00a0parteBriseno,135 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), and again emphasized\nMoore\u2019s adaptive strengths rather than his deficits. That did not\npass muster under this Court\u2019s analysis last time. It still\ndoesn\u2019t. For those reasons, I join the Court\u2019s opinion reversing\nthe judgment below.",
