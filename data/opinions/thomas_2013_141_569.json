As a result, I would hold that a warrantless blood\ndraw does not violate the Fourth Amendment.IAThe Fourth Amendment states that \u201c[t]he right\nof the people to be secure in their persons .\u00a0.\u00a0. against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d Before a search\noccurs, \u201ca warrant must generally be secured,\u201dKentuckyv.King, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5), but\n\u201cthis presumption may be overcome in some circumstances because\n\u2018[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n\u201creasonableness.\u201d \u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingBrig-ham Cityv.Stuart,547 U.S.\n398, 403 (2006); alteration in original).The presence of \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d is one\nsuch exception to the warrant requirement. Exigency applies when\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the needs of law enforcement [are] so compelling that [a]\nwarrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 563 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quotingMinceyv.Arizona,437 U.S.\n385, 394 (1978); second alteration in original). Thus, when\nexigent circumstances are present, officers may take actions that\nwould typically require a warrant, such as entering a home in hot\npursuit of a fleeing suspect. 563 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n6). As relevant in this case, officers may also conduct a\nwarrantless search when they have probable cause to believe that\nfailure to act would result in \u201c\u00a0\u2018imminent destruction of\nevidence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingBrigham City,supra,at 403).BOnce police arrest a suspect for drunk\ndriving, each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the\ncrime. The human liver eliminates alcohol from the bloodstream at a\nrate of approximately 0.015 percent to 0.020 percent per hour,ante,at 8, with some heavy drinkers as high as 0.022\npercent per hour, Brief for Petitioner 21 (citing medical studies),\ndepending on, among other things, a per- son\u2019s sex, weight, body\ntype, and drinking history.Ante,at 8\u20139; Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae23. The Court has acknowledged this\nfact sinceSchmerberv.California,384 U.S.\n757, 770 (1966) (\u201cWe are told that the percentage of alcohol in\nthe blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the\nbody functions to eliminate it from the system\u201d). In that case, the\nCourt recognized that destruction of evidence is inherent in\ndrunk-driving cases and held that an officer investigating a\ndrunk-driving crime \u201cmight reasonably [believe] that he [is]\nconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to\nobtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threaten[s] \u2018the\ndestruction of evidence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingPrestonv.United States,376\nU.S. 364, 367 (1964)). The Court explained that drawing a\nperson\u2019s blood is \u201ca highly ef- fective means of determining the\ndegree to which [he] is under the influence of alcohol\u201d and is a\nreasonable procedure because blood tests are \u201ccommonplace\u201d and\n\u201cinvolv[e] virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.\u201d[1] 384 U.\u00a0S., at 771. The Court, therefore,\nheld that dissipation of alcohol in the blood constitutes an\nexigency that allows a blood draw without a warrant.The rapid destruction of evidence acknowledged\nby the parties, the majority, andSchmerber\u2019s exigency\ndetermination occurs ineverysituation where police have\nprobable cause to arrest a drunk driver. In turn, that destruction\nof evidence implicates the exigent-circumstances doctrine. SeeCuppv.Murphy,412 U.S.\n291(1973). InCupp, officers questioning a murder\nsuspect observed a spot on the suspect\u2019s finger that they believed\nmight be dried blood.Id.,at 292. After the suspect began\nmaking obvious efforts to remove the spots from his hands, the\nofficers took samples without obtaining either his consent or a\nwarrant.Id.,at 296. Following a Fourth Amendment challenge\nto this search, the Court held that the \u201cready destructibility of\nthe evidence\u201d and the suspect\u2019s observed efforts to destroy it\n\u201cjustified the police in subjecting him to the very limited search\nnecessary to preserve the highly evanescent evidence they found\nunder his fingernails.\u201dIbid.In this case, a similar exigency is present.\nJust as the suspect\u2019s efforts to destroy \u201chighly evanescent\nevidence\u201d gave rise to the exigency inCupp, the natural\nmetabolization of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) creates an\nexigency once police have probable cause to believe the driver is\ndrunk. It naturally follows that police may conduct a search in\nthese circumstances.A hypothetical involving classic exigent\ncircumstances further illustrates the point. Officers are watching\na warehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from the\nwarehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into the blaze. The\nofficers have probable cause to believe the bundles contain\nmarijuana. Because there is only one person carrying the bundles,\nthe officers believe it will take hours to completely destroy the\ndrugs. During that time the officers likely could obtain a warrant.\nBut it is clear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch\nthe destruction of evidence while they wait for a warrant. The fact\nthat it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed and thatsomeevidence may remain by the time the offi- cers secure a\nwarrant are not relevant to the exigency. However, the\never-diminishing quantity of drugs may have an impact on the\nseverity of the crime and the length of the sentence. See,e.g., 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(D) (lower penalties\nfor less than 50 kilograms of marijuana); United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2012) (drug quantity\ntable tying base offense level to drug amounts). Conducting a\nwarrantless search of the warehouse in this situation would be\nentirely reasonable.The same obtains in the drunk-driving context.\nJust because it will take time for the evidence to be completely\ndestroyed does not mean there is no exigency. Congress has\nconditioned federal highway grants on states\u2019 adoption of laws\npenalizing the operation of a motor vehicle \u201cwith a blood alcohol\nconcentration of 0.08 percent or greater.\u201d 23 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7163(a). See also 23 CFR \u00a71225.1 (2012). All 50 States have acceded\nto this condition. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. (NHTSA),\nAlcohol and Highway Safety: A Review of the State of Knowledge 167\n(No. 811374, Mar. 2011) (NHTSA State Review); Mo. Ann. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7577.012(1)\u2013(2) (West 2011) (establishing Missouri\u2019s 0.08 percent\nBAC standard). Moreover, as of 2005, 32 States and the District of\nColumbia imposed additional penalties for BAC levels of 0.15\npercent or higher. NHTSA State Review 175. Missouri is one such\nState. See,e.g., Mo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7577.010(3)\u2013(4),\n577.012(4)\u2013(5) (suspended sentence unavailable even for first\noffenders with BAC above 0.15 percent unless they complete drug\ntreatment; mandatory jail time if treatment is not completed). As a\nresult, the level of intoxication directly bears on enforcement of\nthese laws. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment requires officers to\nallow evidence essential to enforcement of drunk-driving laws to be\ndestroyed while they wait for a warrant to issue.IIIn today\u2019s decision, the Court elides the\ncertainty of evidence destruction in drunk-driving cases and\nfocuses primarily on the time necessary for destruction. In doing\nso, it turns the exigency inquiry into a question about the amount\nof evidentiary destruction police must permit before they may act\nwithout a warrant. That inquiry is inconsistent with the actual\nexigency at issue: the un- contested destruction of evidence due to\nmetabolization of alcohol. See Part I,supra. Moreover, the\nCourt\u2019s facts-and-circumstances analysis will be difficult to\nadminister, a particularly important concern in the Fourth\nAmendment context.The Court\u2019s judgment reflects nothing more than\na vague notion that everything will come out right most of the time\nso long as the delay is not too lengthy.Ante,at 12\n(justifying delays in part because \u201cBAC evidence is lost gradually\nand relatively predictably\u201d);ante,at 10 (same, quoting\nBrief for Petitioner 27). But hard percentage lines have meaningful\nlegal consequences in the drunk-driving context. The fact that\npolice will be able to retrievesomeevidence before it is\nall destroyed is simply not relevant to the exigency inquiry.The majority believes that, absent special facts\nand circumstances, some destruction of evidence is acceptable. Seeante, at 9 (\u201csufficient for our purposes to note that\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.significantdelay in testing will negatively\naffect the probative value\u201d (emphasis added)). This belief must\nrest on the assumption that whatever evidence remains once a\nwarrant is obtained will be sufficient to prosecute the suspect.\nBut that assumption is clearly wrong. Suspects\u2019 initial levels of\nintoxication and the time necessary to obtain warranted blood draws\nwill vary widely from case to case. Even a slight delay may\nsignificantly affect probative value in borderline cases of\nsuspects who are moderately intoxicated or suspects whose BAC is\nnear a statutory threshold that triggers a more serious offense.\nSeesupra,at 4\u20135 (discussing laws penalizing heightened BAC\nlevels). Similarly, the time to obtain a warrant can be ex- pected\nto vary, and there is no reason to believe it will do so in a\npredictable fashion.Further, the Court nowhere explains how an\nofficer in the field is to apply the facts-and-circumstances test\nit adopts. First, officers do not have the facts needed to assess\nhow much time can pass before too little evidence remains. They\nwill never know how intoxicated a suspect is at the time of arrest.\nOtherwise, there would be no need for testing. Second, they will\nnot know how long it will take to roust a magistrate from his bed,\nreach the hospital, or obtain a blood sample once there. As the\nMinnesota Supreme Court recognized in rejecting arguments like\nthose adopted by the Court today:\u201c[T]he officer has no control over how\nlong it would take to travel to a judge or the judge\u2019s\navailability. The officer also may not know the time of the\nsuspect\u2019s last drink, the amount of alcohol consumed, or the rate\nat which the suspect will metabolize alcohol. Finally, an officer\ncannot know how long it will take to obtain the blood sample once\nthe suspect is brought to the hospital. Under a totality of the\ncircumstances test, an officer would be called upon to speculate on\neach of these considerations and predict how long the most\nprobative evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level would\ncontinue to exist before a blood sample was no longer reliable.\u201dStatev.Shriner, 751 N.W.2d 538, 549 (2008)\n(footnote omitted).The Court should not adopt a rule that requires\npolice to guess whether they will be able to obtain a warrant\nbefore \u201ctoo much\u201d evidence is destroyed, for the police lack reli-\nable information concerning the relevant variables.[2]This case demonstrates the uncertainty officers\nface with regard to the delay caused by obtaining a warrant. The\narresting officer clearly had probable cause to believe respondent\nwas drunk, but there was no way for the officer to quantify the\nlevel of intoxication to determine how quickly he needed to act in\norder to obtain probative evidence. Another officer testified at\nrespondent\u2019s trial that it typically took 1 \u00bd to 2 hours to obtain\na drunk-driving warrant at night in Cape Girardeau County,\nMissouri. See App. 53\u201354. Respondent submitted an exhibit\nsummarizing six late afternoon and nighttime drunk-driving search\nwarrants that suggests the time may be shorter. Brief for\nRespondent 56; App. 70. Ultimately this factual tiff is beside the\npoint; the spotty evidence regarding timing itself illustrates the\nfact that delays in obtaining warrants are unpredictable and\npotentially lengthy. A rule that requires officers (and ultimately\ncourts) to balance transportation delays, hospital availability,\nand ac- cess to magistrates is not a workable rule for cases where\nnatural processes inevitably destroy the evidence with every\npassing minute.The availability of telephonic warrant\napplications is not an answer to this conundrum. Seeante,\nat 10\u201312, and n.\u00a04. For one thing, Missouri still requires\nwritten warrant applications and affidavits, Mo. Ann. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7542.276.2(1), 542.276.2.3 (West Supp. 2012), rendering the\nCourt\u2019s 50-State survey irrelevant to the actual disposition of\nthis case.Ante,at 11, n.\u00a04. But even if telephonic\napplications were available in Missouri, the same difficulties\nwould arise. As the majority correctly recognizes, \u201c[w]arrants\ninevitably take some time for police officers or prosecutors to\ncomplete and for magistrate judges to review.\u201dAnte, at 12.\nDuring that time, evidence is destroyed, and police who have\nprobable cause to believe a crime has been committed should not\nhave to guess how long it will take to secure a warrant.***For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1Neither party has\nchallenged this determination, which this Court has reaffirmed\nseveral times. See,e.g.,Skinnerv.Railway Labor\nExecutives\u2019 Assn.,489 U.S.\n602, 625 (1989);Winstonv.Lee,470 U.S.\n753, 761\u2013763 (1985).2Because the Court\u2019s\nposition is likely to result in delay in obtaining BAC evidence, it\nalso increases the likelihood that prosecutors will be forced to\nestimate the amount of alcohol in a defendant\u2019s bloodstream using\nBAC numbers obtained hours later. In practice, this backwards\nextrapolation is likely to devolve into a battle of the experts, as\neach side seeks to show that stale evidence supports its position.\nThere is no need for this outcome. Police facing inevitable\ndestruction situations need not forgo collecting the most accurate\navailable evidence simply because they might be able to use an\nexpert witness and less persuasive evidence to approximate what\nthey lost.",
