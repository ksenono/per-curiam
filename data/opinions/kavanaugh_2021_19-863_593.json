    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u2013863_________________AGUSTO NIZ-CHAVEZ, PETITIONERv.MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERALon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[April 29, 2021]Justice Kavanaugh, with whom The Chief Justice\nand Justice Alito join, dissenting.Agusto Niz-Chavez is a native and citizen of\nGuatemala. In 2005, Niz-Chavez unlawfully entered the United States\nthrough the southern border and eventually settled in Detroit. In\n2013, the Government initiated removal proceedings against\nNiz-Chavez. After the removal hearings, an Immigration Judge\nordered Niz-Chavez to either voluntarily depart from the United\nStates within 30 days or else be removed to Guatemala.The Court today casts aside the Immigration\nJudge\u2019s order and allows Niz-Chavez to go back to immigration court\nto seek cancellation of removal. Why? The Court says that\nNiz-Chavez did not receive proper notice of his removal proceedings\nbecause he received notice in two documents rather than one. The\nCourt so holds even though Niz-Chavez (i) received all the\nstatutorily required information about his removal proceedings,\nincluding the time and place of the removal hearing; (ii) was not\nprejudiced in any way by receiving notice in two documents rather\nthan one; and (iii) in fact appeared with counsel at his scheduled\nremoval hearing.The Court\u2019s decision contravenes Congress\u2019s\ndetailed requirements for a noncitizen to obtain cancellation of\nremoval. When the Government seeks to remove a noncitizen such as\nNiz-Chavez who is unlawfully in the country, it begins the process\nby sending the noncitizen a notice to appear for removal\nproceedings. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229(a)(1). In the subsequent\nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge, the noncitizen may\ncontest the grounds for removal and may also ask the immigration\njudge to grant various forms of relief, including discretionary\ncancellation of removal. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), (b)(1).A noncitizen\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of\nremoval depends in part on when the noncitizen received notice of\nthe removal proceeding. To be eligible, a noncitizen who is a\nnonpermanent resident must have been continuously present in the\nUnited States for at least 10 years. \u00a71229b(b)(1)(A). The 10-year\nclock stops, however, when the noncitizen is served \u201ca notice to\nappear\u201d for the removal proceeding. \u00a71229b(d)(1).Because service of a notice to appear stops the\n10-year clock and may make the noncitizen ineligible for\ncancellation of removal, noncitizens who want to apply for\ncancellation of removal (and courts) must know what constitutes a\nnotice to appear. Federal immigration law answers that question.\nThe relevant statute defines a notice to appear as \u201cwritten\nnotice,\u201d which must be served in person or by mail and which\nprovides certain required information, such as the alleged grounds\nfor removal and the time and place of the removal hearing.\n\u00a71229(a)(1); seePereirav.Sessions, 585 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 13\u201314) (\u00a71229(a)(1) provides the\ndefinition of a notice to appear for purposes of the 10-year\nclock).In this case, the United States commenced\nremoval proceedings against Niz-Chavez in 2013\u2014eight years after he\nentered the United States. The Government served two documents on\nNiz-Chavez. In March 2013, Niz-Chavez received the first document,\nwhich notified him that he was being charged as removable because\nhe was unlawfully in the country. It explained that he would have\nto appear for a removal hearing at the immigration court in Detroit\nat a time to be set in the future. Two months later, he received\nthe second document, which notified him that the removal hearing\nwould occur at the immigration court in Detroit on June 25, 2013,\nat 8:30 a.m. The two documents together included all the\nstatutorily required information. See \u00a71229(a)(1). Niz-Chavez\nappeared with counsel at the scheduled hearing on June 25,\n2013.At the hearing, Niz-Chavez conceded that he was\nremovable because he was unlawfully in the country. Moreover,\nNiz-Chavez did not request cancellation of removal or suggest that\nhe was eligible for cancellation of removal, presumably because he\nreceived the notice to appear long before he had accrued 10 years\nof continuous presence in the United States. After further\nhearings, an Immigration Judge found Niz-Chavez removable as\ncharged and ordered Niz-Chavez to either voluntarily depart from\nthe United States within 30 days or else be removed to\nGuatemala.Niz-Chavez now argues that he in fact should be\neligible for cancellation of removal. He emphasizes that the\ncontinuous-presence clock stops upon service of \u201canotice to\nappear.\u201d \u00a71229b(d)(1). That language, according to Niz-Chavez,\nmeans that, to stop the 10-year clock, the Government must provide\nall the required informationin one document, rather than\ntwo. The Government responds that the statute includes no such\nrequirement and that the Government may serve a notice to appearin two documents, with the time and place of the hearing\ncoming in the second document and the 10-year clock stopping\nthen.The Court today agrees with Niz-Chavez that, in\norder to stop the 10-year clock, the Government must provide\nwritten notice in one document, not two. I find the Court\u2019s\nconclusion rather perplexing as a matter of statutory\ninterpretation and common sense. I therefore respectfully\ndissent.IAThis is not the Court\u2019s first case involving a\nnotice to appear for removal proceedings. InPereirav.Sessions, the Court held that a notice that does not provide\nthe time and place of the hearing does not stop the 10-year\ncontinuous-presence clock. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip\nop., at 2). BeforePereira, the Government (in some\nCircuits) could send two documents as it did in this case and stop\nthe clock when it served the first, incomplete document. Seeid., at ___\u2013___, and n. 4 (slip op., at 7\u20138, and n.\u00a04).\nIn the wake ofPereira, however, service of the first\ndocument no longer stops the clock. The clock does not stop until\nthe Government also provides the time and place of the hearing.InPereira, the Court did not address the\ndistinct question whether the Government may serve a notice to\nappear in two documents instead of one, with the time and place of\nthe hearing coming in the second document and the clock then\nstopping upon service of the second document. We must decide that\nquestion here.AfterPereira, why would the Government\nstill provide notice in two documents instead of one comprehensive\ndocument? Simple. When the Government wants to inform the\nnoncitizen that it is initiating removal proceedings, the\nGovernment may not yet know exactly when the hearing will occur. So\nthe Government sometimes will first inform the noncitizen of the\ncharges, and only later provide the exact time and place of the\nhearing.AfterPereira, the Government gains no\nadvantage by providing notice in two documents, because the 10-year\ncontinuous-presence clock does not stop until the noncitizen has\nalso been served the statutorily required time and place\ninformation. Seeid., at ___ (slip op., at 2). If anyone\ngains an advantage from two-document notice afterPereira,\nit is noncitizens. They can learn of the removal proceedings and\nbegin preparing a defense even before they receive notice of the\ntime and place of the hearing. So receiving notice in two documents\ncan benefit noncitizens.Even though receiving notice in two documents\nwould benefit noncitizens as a group by giving them more time to\nprepare for hearings, Niz-Chavez understandably seeks to advance\nhis own interests in not having the 10-year clock stopped in his\nindividual case. Niz-Chavez says that to stop the 10-year clock,\nthe Government must provide a single document with all the\nstatutorily required information, because the statute requires\n\u201canotice to appear.\u201dBThe Court agrees with Niz-Chavez, resting its\nconclusion almost entirely on the word \u201ca\u201d in the statutory phrase\n\u201ca notice to appear.\u201d As the Court notes, Congress provided that\nthe 10-year continuous-presence clock stops when the noncitizen is\nserved \u201ca notice to appear\u201d for removal proceedings. 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229b(d)(1).[1] The Court says that the article \u201ca\u201d means that the\n10-year continuous-presence clock stops only if the Government\nserves a single document with all the required information to\ninitiate the removal proceedings, not two documents with all the\nrequired information. In my respectful view, the Court\u2019s textual\ninterpretation contains two independent flaws, either of which\nsuffices to defeat the Court\u2019s conclusion.First, the Court\u2019s analysis disregards\nthe statutory definition of a notice to appear.When a statute defines a term, we ordinarily\nfollow the statutory definition.Digital Realty Trust, Inc.v.Somers, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9);Burgessv.United States,553\nU.S. 124, 129\u2013130 (2008). Here, the statute defines a notice to\nappear in a somewhat oddly worded way. The definition is located in\nthe statutory provision that specifies how the Government must\ninitiate removal proceedings. That provision states: \u201cwritten\nnotice (in this section referred to as a \u2018notice to appear\u2019)shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is\nnot practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the\nalien\u2019s counsel of record, if any) specifying\u201d 10 categories of\ninformation relevant to the removal proceedings. \u00a71229(a)(1)\n(emphasis added); see alsoPereira, 585 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201314) (\u00a71229(a)(1) provides the definition\nof a notice to appear for purposes of the 10-year clock).[2]In other words, the statute provides that the\n10-year continuous-presence clock stops upon service of \u201ca notice\nto appear,\u201d and then goes on to define a notice to appear as\n\u201cwritten notice.\u201d The statute nowhere says that written notice must\nbe provided in a single document. Rather, the statute lists three\nessential requirements for the Government to notify a noncitizen of\nremoval proceedings: (i) the notice must be \u201cwritten notice\u201d; (ii)\nit must be \u201cgiven in person,\u201d if practicable, or else by mail; and\n(iii) the notice must include the required information, such as the\ngrounds for removal and the time and place of the hearing.\n\u00a71229(a)(1). Nothing more. But the Court today nonetheless imposes\na fourth, atextual single-document requirement for the notice to\nstop the 10-year clock.If Congress actually wanted to require a single\ndocument to stop the 10-year clock, Congress easily could have (and\nsurely would have) said so. After all, the statute supplies\ncomprehensive and detailed instructions about how the Government\nmust serve a notice to appear and what information must be\nincluded. But the statute never says that all the required\ninformation must appear in a single document.Notice delivered in two installments can readily\nsatisfy all the requirements of a notice to appear. Consider the\nnotice served on Niz-Chavez in this case. It was written notice. It\nwas properly served. It contained all the statutorily required\ninformation, including the time and place of the hearing. The\nstatute contemplates nothing more of a notice to appear.Instead of applying that clear statutory\ndefinition of a notice to appear as written notice, the Court\ndismisses the definition\u2019s relevance on a novel basis not raised by\nNiz-Chavez, not advanced by anyamicusbrief, and not\nadopted by any lower courts\u2014the placement of a quotation mark. The\nCourt reasons that the quotation marks in the statutory definition\nappear around only the words \u201cnotice to appear,\u201d rather than around\n\u201canotice to appear.\u201d On that basis, the Court insists that\nthe phrase \u201cwritten notice\u201d defines only the three words \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201d\u2014without the \u201ca.\u201d And substituting \u201cwritten notice\u201d for\n\u201cnotice to appear\u201d in the statutory provision addressing the\n10-year clock would still require \u201ca\u201d written notice, which the\nCourt interprets to mean a single document.According to the Court, Congress thus imposed a\nsingle-document requirement for stopping the 10-year clock not by\nactually saying that a single document is required, but rather by\nplacing quotation marks around the wordsa \u201cnotice to\nappear\u201drather than\u201ca notice to appear\u201din the\nstatutory definition. There is a good reason that Niz-Chavez did\nnot raise this argument, that noamicusbrief advanced this\nargument, and that no court has adopted it. The Court\u2019s theory is\nmistaken and implausible. If Congress wanted to require a single\ndocument in order to stop the 10-year clock, it is hard to imagine\na more obscure way of doing so. Although \u201cthe meaning of a statute\nwill typically heed the commands of its punctuation,\u201d \u201ca purported\nplain-meaning analysis based only on punctuation is necessarily\nincomplete and runs the risk of distorting a statute\u2019s true\nmeaning.\u201dUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore.v.Independent\nIns. Agents of America, Inc.,508 U.S.\n439, 454 (1993). The Court has declined to rely on \u201cthe\ndeployment of quotation marks\u201d when \u201call of the other evidence from\nthe statute points the other way.\u201dId.,at 455.So it is here. The Court\u2019s quotation-mark theory\ncontravenes the statutory text and structure. The text and\nstructure make clear that the notice that initiates removal\nproceedings is the same notice that stops the 10-year clock. See\n\u00a7\u00a71229(a)(1), 1229b(d)(1). But the Court\u2019s interpretation treats\nthem as different by imposing different requirements for a notice\nthat stops the 10-year clock and for a notice that initiates\nremoval proceedings. To reiterate, to initiate removal proceedings,\nthe Government must provide the noncitizen with \u201cwritten notice.\u201d\nThe Court does not dispute (and cannot dispute) that the Government\ncan initiate removal proceedings by providing written notice in\nmore than one document, so long as the notice encompasses all the\nstatutorily required information. Nonetheless, for that written\nnotice to also stop the 10-year clock, the Court says that the\nwritten notice must be provided in a single document rather than\ntwo documents because the 10-year clock provision requires\n\u201canotice to appear.\u201d Stated otherwise, under the Court\u2019s\nnovel theory, the Government may use two documents to initiate\nremoval proceedings, but the Government must use a single document\nif it also wants to stop the continuous-presence clock\u2014even though\nCongress explicitly linked the notice that stops the clock to the\nnotice that initiates removal proceedings. Put simply, the Court\u2019s\nargument based on the placement of a quotation mark contravenes the\nstraightforward statutory structure and makes little sense.The Court\u2019s novel interpretation also creates\nanother inconsistency. Section 1229a(b)(5) explains that a\nnoncitizen who fails to attend a removal hearing may be removed in\nabsentia if he had previously been provided with \u201cwritten notice\u201d\nunder \u00a71229(a)(1). Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, it is hard to\nsee why such notice would need to be provided in a single\ndocument\u2014there are no dangling uses of \u201ca\u201d to latch onto in that\nprovision. It makes no sense that two-document notice could justify\nremoval in absentia but could not stop the continuous-presence\nclock.In sum, the Court\u2019s theory for disregarding the\nstatutory definition is both novel and unpersuasive. The Court\u2019s\nquotation-mark argument fails because it distorts the \u201cstatute\u2019s\ntrue meaning.\u201dUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore., 508\nU.\u00a0S., at 454. When the statutory definition of a notice to\nappear as \u201cwritten notice\u201d is correctly applied, instead of\nsidestepped, it readily resolves what should have been a very\nsimple statutory case.Second, even if there were no definition\nin this statute and we therefore had to focus solely on the term \u201ca\nnotice to appear\u201d in isolation, the Court\u2019s interpretation of that\nphrase would still fail.Ordinary meaning and literal meaning are two\ndifferent things. And judges interpreting statutes should follow\nordinary meaning, not literal meaning. See,e.g.,McBoylev.United States,283 U.S.\n25, 26 (1931) (in ordinary speech, \u201cvehicle\u201d does not cover an\naircraft, even though \u201cetymologically it is possible to use the\nword\u201d that way); see also A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 24\n(1997) (a \u201cgood textualist is not a literalist\u201d). The Court here,\nhowever, relies heavily on literal meaning: The Court interprets\nthe word \u201ca\u201d in the phrase \u201ca notice to appear\u201d to literally\nrequire the Government to serve one (and only one) document. In the\nCourt\u2019s words, \u201ca notice\u201d requires \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\u2019 single document\ncontaining the required information.\u201dAnte,at 5.As a matter of ordinary parlance, however, the\nword \u201ca\u201d is not a one-size-fits-all word. As relevant here, the\nword \u201ca\u201d is sometimes used to modify a single thing that must be\ndelivered in one package, but it is sometimes used to modify a\nsingle thing that can be delivered in multiple installments, rather\nthan in one installment. Context is critical to determine the\nproper meaning of \u201ca\u201d in a particular phrase. Consider some\nexamples. A car dealership that promises to ship \u201ca car\u201d to a\ncustomer has not fulfilled its obligation if it sends the customer\none car part at a time. By contrast, it is common to submit \u201ca job\napplication\u201d by sending a resume first and then references as they\nare available. When the final reference arrives, the applicant has\nsubmitted \u201ca job application.\u201d Similarly, an author might submit\nchapters of a novel to an editor one at a time, as they are ready.\nUpon submission of the final chapter, the author undoubtedly has\nsubmitted \u201ca manuscript.\u201d \u201cA contract\u201d likewise can be \u201cestablished\nby multiple documents.\u201dSecretary of U.\u00a0S. Air Forcev.Commemorative Air Force, 585 F.3d 895, 901 (CA6 2009). The\nlist goes on.As those examples demonstrate, and as the Court\nacknowledges, the article \u201ca\u201d can be perfectly consistent with\ndelivery in installments. And in this case, the better reading of\nthe article \u201ca\u201d is that it does not require delivery in only one\ninstallment. A notice to appear for a removal hearing is more like\na job application, a manuscript, and a contract than it is like a\ncar. A notice to appear conveys information, like a job\napplication, a manuscript, and a contract. And unlike a car, a\nnotice to appear is easy for the recipient to assemble from its\nconstituent installments.The Court prefers a different analogy. To\nbuttress its interpretation, the Court analogizes the notice to\nappear to legal documents that initiate criminal cases, like\nindictments. The Court reasons that \u201can indictment\u201d traditionally\nprovides all the required information in a single document, so \u201ca\nnotice to appear\u201d must do so as well.Ante,at 7\u20138.But that analogy is misplaced. An indictment\ngenerally provides charging information. By contrast, a notice to\nappear provides charging informationandlogistical\ncalendaring information that is not always knowable at the time of\ncharging. As the Court said inPereira, a notice to appear\nis more than just a charging document because it serves \u201canother\nequally integral function: telling a noncitizen when and where to\nappear.\u201d See 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 13,\nn.\u00a07). In other words, a notice to appear is akin to a\ncharging documentplusa calendaring document. It is\ntherefore easy to understand why a notice to appear might require\ntwo installments while an indictment requires only one. The analogy\nto an indictment actually cuts stronglyagainstthe Court\u2019s\ninterpretation.In addition, interpreting \u201ca notice to appear\u201d\nto allow delivery in two documents makes much more sense in context\nhere because it allows the Government to alert the noncitizen of\nthe charges well before a time and place have been set for the\nhearing. That affords the noncitizen more time to prepare a\ndefense. And a noncitizen suffers no prejudice from receiving\nnotice in two documents rather than one, as Niz-Chavez\u2019s case amply\ndemonstrates. In short, a noncitizen gains something and loses\nnothing meaningful from receiving all the information in two\ndocuments. (The same cannot be said for receiving a car in two\ninstallments, for example.)The Court\u2019s interpretation, by contrast, spawns\na litany of absurdities. For example, under the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation, the 10-year clock does not stop if the noncitizen\nreceives the two separate documentson the same daybut\nin different envelopes. But the clock does stop if the\nnoncitizen receives the two documents in one envelope. What sense\ndoes that make? Moreover, if a noncitizen receives a first document\nwithout a time and place and a second document with only the time\nand place, that does not stop the clock under the Court\u2019s rule. But\nif a noncitizen receives a first document with all the information\nincluding the time and place and then a second document with all\nthe information and anewtime and place, that first\ndocument does stop the clock under the Court\u2019s rule. What sense\ndoes that make?Indeed, the Court deems Niz-Chavez to have never\nreceived proper notice of the hearing even though he received all\nthe statutorily required information andactually appeared with\ncounsel at the hearing. Again, what sense does that make?The Court blames those absurdities on Congress\nand says that Congress would have chosen to omit the article \u201ca\u201d if\nit wanted to allow two documents. The Court\u2019s apparent theory is\nthat Congress deliberately employed the word \u201ca\u201d to obliquely\nimpose an additional procedural obligation on the Government when\nthe Government initiates removal proceedings against a noncitizen\nand wants to stop the 10-year clock. That theory is no more\nplausible than the Court\u2019s first theory that Congress used the\nplacement of a quotation mark to impose a new procedural\nobligation. Once again, if Congress wanted to require the\nGovernment to send a notice to appear in one document rather than\ntwo documents in order to stop the 10-year clock, Congress easily\ncould have said so, and undoubtedly would have said so. But it did\nnot. The bottom line is that this new single-document requirement\ncomes from this Court, not Congress. The Court\u2019s attempt to deflect\nblame is unpersuasive.In sum, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the\nstatutory text is wrong for two independent reasons, either of\nwhich suffices to defeat the Court\u2019s conclusion. First, the\nstatutory definition of a notice to appear as \u201cwritten notice\u201d\nestablishes that \u201ca notice to appear\u201d can be delivered in two\ninstallments. Second, even if there were no statutory definition,\nthe best reading of \u201ca notice to appear\u201d in this context is that\nthe notice can be provided in two installments.CThe Court seeks to support its textual\nanalysis with additional arguments based on structure, statutory\nhistory, and post-enactment regulatory history. Those arguments do\nnot help.First, start with structure. The Court\nsays that three other statutory provisions\u2014\u00a7\u00a71229(e)(1),\n1229a(b)(7), and 1229(a)(2)\u2014imply that a notice to appear is a\nsingle document.Ante, at 9\u201311. But none of the three\nprovisions actually requires the Government to serve a notice to\nappear in a single document. Moreover, the language in all three\nprovisions is consistent with a two-document notice to appear.The first provision, \u00a71229(e)(1), addresses the\nGovernment\u2019s notice obligations when it seizes a noncitizen at a\ndomestic violence shelter or other location as a precursor to\nremoval proceedings. In those cases, \u00a71229(e)(1) says that \u201cthe\nNotice to Appear shall include\u201d a statement that the Government has\ncomplied with certain protections for noncitizens. The Court says\nthat the phrase \u201cthe Notice\u201d implies a single document because it\npairs an article with a singular noun.Ante, at 9\u201310. But\nthe reference in \u00a71229(e)(1) to \u201cthe Notice to Appear\u201d does not\nrequire or even contemplate a single document. Like the article\n\u201ca,\u201d the article \u201cthe\u201d can be used with a thing delivered in\nconstituent installments\u2014consider \u201cthe job application,\u201d \u201cthe\nmanuscript,\u201d or \u201cthe contract.\u201d Section 1229(e)(1) simply requires\nthe Government to include the necessary statement of compliance in\none of the documents constituting the notice to appear.The second provision, \u00a71229a(b)(7), concerns\nnoncitizens who fail to appear at removal proceedings and are\nordered removed in absentia. Section 1229a(b)(7) says that a\nnoncitizen in that situation is ineligible for certain kinds of\nrelief from removal for 10 years if the noncitizen was provided\noral notice \u201cat the time of\u00a0\u201d the written notice to appear.\n\u00a71229a(b)(7). The Court argues that the provision\u2019s reference to\n\u201cthe time of\u00a0\u201d the written notice implies that the written\nnotice is necessarily delivered at one particular moment, and\ntherefore in one single document.Ante, at 10\u201311. On the\ncontrary, the reference in \u00a71229a(b)(7) to \u201cthe time of\u00a0\u201d the\nwritten notice is entirely consistent with two-document notice.\nNotice qualifies as \u201ca notice to appear\u201d only when it includes the\ntime and place of the removal hearing.Pereira, 585\nU.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 9). So when the Government\nuses two documents to serve a notice to appear, \u201cthe time of\u00a0\u201d\nthe written notice is the time when the noncitizen is served the\nsecond installment that provides the time and place of the\nhearing.The third provision, \u00a71229(a)(2), supplies a\nprocedure for changing the time or place of a removal hearing. It\nrequires the Government to give a noncitizen \u201ca written notice\u201d of\nthe new time and place. The Court concludes that the reference to\n\u201cawritten notice\u201d requires a single document, and so\n\u201canotice to appear\u201d must as well.Ante,at 11. As a\npractical matter, the Government may need only one document to\nchange the time or place of the hearing. But the word \u201ca\u201d in the\nphrase \u201ca written notice\u201d does notrequirethe Government to\nuse a single document, just as the word \u201ca\u201d in the phrase \u201ca notice\nto appear\u201d does not. Section 1229(a)(2), like the other two\nprovisions, is entirely consistent with the Government\u2019s reading of\nthe statute.Second, the Court also invokes statutory\nhistory to support its interpretation. But the statutory history\ndoes not advance the Court\u2019s argument. Before 1996, the immigration\nstatute required the Government to serve an \u201corder to show cause\u201d\nrather than a notice to appear. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252b(a)(1)\n(1994 ed.). Back then, the statute allowed the Government to notify\na noncitizen of the time and place of the removal hearing either\n\u201cin the order to show cause or otherwise.\u201d \u00a71252b(a)(2)(A) (1994\ned.). The pre-1996 statute similarly defined an order to show cause\nas \u201cwritten notice\u201d\u2014a broad term that does not require one\ndocument. \u00a71252b(a)(1) (1994 ed.). In 1996, Congress made some\nsignificant changes. Congress replaced suspension of deportation\nwith cancellation of removal. Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act, \u00a7\u00a7304(a), 308(b)(7), 110Stat.\n3009\u2013587, 3009\u2013615 (codified at 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229b).\nCongress extended the continuous-presence requirement to 10 years\nfor nonpermanent residents. 110Stat. 3009\u2013594 (codified at\n\u00a71229b(b)(1)(A)). Congress also changed the order to show cause to\na notice to appear, and required the Government to provide the time\nand place information in that notice to appear. 110Stat. 3009\u2013588\n(codified at \u00a71229(a)(1)(G)(i)). And Congress also provided for the\nfirst time that service of the notice to appear would stop the\ncontinuous-presence clock. 110Stat. 3009\u2013595 (codified at\n\u00a71229b(d)(1)).But amid all those changes, Congress never\nrequired that a notice to appear include all the required\ninformation in a single document. The Court nonetheless speculates\nthat a \u201crational Congress easily could have thought\u201d it sensible to\npeg the end of the continuous-presence clock to a single document.Ante, at 11. Maybe so. But a rational Congress also could\nhave declined to impose a single-document requirement. What matters\nis that theactualCongress declined to impose a\nsingle-document requirement in 1996, just as it had declined to do\nbefore 1996.Third, the Court turns to post-enactment\nregulatory history. According to the Court, language in the\npreamble to a 1997 notice of proposed rulemaking issued jointly by\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Executive Office\nfor Immigration Review suggests that those agencies once believed\nthat a single document was required.Ante,at 12; see 62\nFed. Reg. 449. Even assuming that this executive agency\ninterpretation (found in a preamble to a notice of proposed\nrulemaking) could alter the otherwise-best interpretation of the\nstatute, the proposed rule that follows the preamble undercuts the\nCourt\u2019s characterization of the agencies\u2019 1997 position. The 1997\nproposed rule stated that the Government would include the time and\nplace of the removal hearing in the initial charging document\n\u201cwhere practicable.\u201dId.,at 457 (emphasis added).\nAnd the proposed rule gave alternative instructions for when time\nand place information \u201cis not contained\u201d in the initial document.Ibid.That formulation does not reflect a single-document\ninterpretation of the statute. So post-enactment regulatory history\ndoes not help the Court any more than statutory history; indeed,\nthe post-enactment regulatory history appears in significant\ntension with the Court\u2019s reading.In the end, the Court\u2019s arguments based on\nstructure and history all fail to answer a very simple question: If\nCongress wanted all the information to be included in one document\nin order to stop the 10-year clock, why did Congress not say that\nall the information must be included in one document?IIThe Court concludes its opinion by suggesting\nthat its decision will rein in the Federal Government and produce\npolicy benefits for noncitizens. But the Court\u2019s decision will not\nmeaningfully benefit noncitizens going forward, and it will\nultimately benefit few if any noncitizens who have already been\nnotified of their removal proceedings. Meanwhile, the Court\u2019s\ndecision will impose significant costs on the immigration system,\nwhich of course means more backlog forother noncitizensinvolved in other immigration cases.To be clear, demonstrating that the Court is\nwrong to predict policy benefits from its decision is not ignoring\na \u201cstatutory command\u201d in favor of policy views.Ante,at 15.\nRather, the point here is that the Court\u2019s opinion both errs as a\nmatter of statutory interpretationandwill not meaningfully\nhelp noncitizens, contrary to the Court\u2019s prediction.Start with the supposed policy benefit that the\nCourt identifies: The Court suggests that its decision will help\nnoncitizens by stopping the Government from sending numerous\ndocuments (more than two) to noncitizens over a period of months or\neven years, perhaps in an effort to confuse them. But the Court\ndoes not point to any examples of the Governmentactuallyserving a notice to appear in more than two documents, or over a\nperiod of years. After all, why would the Government do so, absent\na need to reschedule a hearing? It would make no sense. Under the\nstatute as interpreted inPereira, the Government cannot\nstop the continuous-presence clock until it provides the time and\nplace of the removal hearing. And the immigration court cannot\ncommence the removal hearing until the Government does so. So\nwasting years and sending multiple documents to serve a notice to\nappear would only work to the Government\u2019s disadvantage because it\nwould delay the hearing. The supposed \u201cbenefit\u201d of the Court\u2019s\ndecision, then, is simply to prevent the Government from doing\nsomething that it has no incentive to do in the first place. The\nCourt\u2019s opinion cures a problem of its own imagination.In fact, the Court\u2019s decision will not alter the\ndelivery of notice in any meaningful way. Going forward, when the\nGovernment wants to initiate the process of removing a noncitizen\nbefore it knows with certainty the time and place of the\nnoncitizen\u2019s initial removal hearing, the Government can comply\nwith today\u2019s decision in one of three ways. None of the three\nalternatives provides meaningful benefits for noncitizens as\ncompared to the Government\u2019s current practice of sometimes using\ntwo documents, and two of the options are worse for\nnoncitizens.The first way that the Government can comply\nwith today\u2019s decision is simply to do what it did in Niz-Chavez\u2019s\ncase, with one minor change. The Government can still send an\ninitial document that informs the noncitizen of all relevant\ninformation except the time and place of the hearing, and then a\nsecond document that supplies the time and place of the hearing.\nAll that the Government needs to do to comply with today\u2019s decision\nand still stop the 10-year clock is to repeat all the information\nfrom the first document in the second document, or alternatively to\nprovide a copy of the first document when it serves the second.\nDelivered together, the two attachments will form a single,\ncomplete notice to appear even under the Court\u2019s strained\ninterpretation, and therefore will stop the 10-year clock. (Counsel\nfor Niz-Chavez forthrightly conceded all of this at oral argument.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 24.) The Court insists that this change in\npractice will still help noncitizens, but it fails to explain how.\nThe first document sent to Niz-Chavez in this case informed him\nthat he was required to carry the document with him at all times.\nEspecially in light of that obligation, it is hard to see any\nmeaningful benefit in the Government\u2019s resending the same initial\ndocument to a noncitizen once the hearing has been scheduled.But even if that first possible method of\ncomplying with today\u2019s decision would benefit noncitizens in some\nminimal way, it is not clear that the Government will actually\nchoose that option. Instead, the Government can comply with today\u2019s\ndecision in other ways that will leave noncitizensworse\noff. As a second option, for example, the Government may stop\nsending the first document at all and just wait until it can\nprovide all the information in one comprehensive\ndocument\u2014necessarily closer to the date of the hearing. That would\nindisputably comply with today\u2019s decision but would disadvantage\nnoncitizens by affording them less time to prepare for removal\nhearings.The third possible option is no better for\nnoncitizens. When the Government is ready to initiate removal\nproceedings but does not know the time and place of a hearing, it\ncould comply with the Court\u2019s decision by sending a document with a\nplaceholder time and place of the hearing and then later serve a\nsecond document with the actual time and place of the hearing. As\ncounsel for Niz-Chavez conceded at oral argument, doing so would\ncomply with the statute and allow the Government to stop the\ncontinuous-presence clock upon service of theinitialdocument rather than the second document.Id.,at 15. That\noption would give noncitizenslesstime to accrue continuous\npresence than when the Government includes the time and place only\nin the second document. Moreover, that approach\u2014sending the\nnoncitizen two different times or places\u2014is a recipe for\nconfusion.In short, the Court\u2019s conclusion today will not\nnecessarily help noncitizens or constrain the Government going\nforward.[3]Butlooking backwards, will the Court\u2019s\ndecision at least supply a benefit to some noncitizens such as\nNiz-Chavez whopreviouslyreceived a notice to appear in two\ndocuments? To begin with, any noncitizen who becomes eligible for\ncancellation of removal notwithstanding the noncitizen\u2019s receipt of\nall the required information in writing before 10 years of\ncontinuous presence would receive a windfall based on the thinnest\nof technicalities. Consider Niz-Chavez himself. He received all the\nrequired information before the 10-year clock had run, he showed up\nat the hearing with counsel, and he suffered zero prejudice from\nreceiving notice in two documents rather than one.But in any event, that eligibility windfall is\nunlikely to translate to any real-world benefit for many\nnoncitizens in Niz-Chavez\u2019s position. To be sure, today\u2019s decision\nmeans that some noncitizens in Niz-Chavez\u2019s position will now\nbecomeeligiblefor cancellation of removal. But that does\nnot mean that those noncitizens will actuallyreceivecancellation of removal as a result of today\u2019s decision.\nCancellation of removal is discretionary. \u00a7\u00a71229b(a), (b)(1). In\nother words, today\u2019s decision means only that immigration judges\nhave discretion to grant cancellation of removal for some\nnoncitizens who received notice in two documents.And there is another apparent catch. Subject to\na few exceptions not relevant here, the number of noncitizens who\nmay receive cancellation of removal is capped by statute at only\n4,000 per year. \u00a71229b(e)(1). Those 4,000 spots are \u201ccoveted and\nscarce\u201d\u2014so scarce, in fact, that in recent years, \u201caccording to the\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review, 3,500 cancellation of\nremoval slots have been filled on the first day\u201d of the year.Matter of Castillo-Perez, 27 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 664,\n669 (Atty. Gen. 2019). \u201cThe other 500 slots are set aside to be\ngranted to detained aliens throughout the year.\u201dIbid.Perhaps a small handful of the noncitizens who receive an\neligibility windfall as a result of today\u2019s decision will\nultimately also receive cancellation of removal. But that is far\nfrom clear.Meanwhile, the Court\u2019s decision will impose\nsubstantial costs and burdens on the immigration system, as the\nGovernment has detailed. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\u201354. Because today\u2019s\ndecision means that many more people who have been in removal\nproceedings may be eligible for cancellation of removal, presumably\nmany more people will apply. And processing all of those extra\napplications for cancellation of removal will impose costs on the\nimmigration system and create backlogs and delays for other\nnoncitizens trying to get their day in court. More than 1.2 million\ncases are currently inching their way through the immigration\ncourts. Dept. of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review\nAdjudication Statistics, Pending Cases, New Cases, and Total\nCompletions (Jan. 7, 2021). If even a small portion of the\nnoncitizens with pending removal cases become eligible for\ncancellation of removal solely because of today\u2019s decision, and\nthen apply for cancellation of removal, the immigration courts will\nneed to expend substantial resources to timely consider those\napplications for relief, even though many of them are likely to be\ndenied.In sum, the Court\u2019s statutory conclusion in this\ncase will not necessarily help noncitizens. The Court\u2019s statutory\ninterpretation is not likely to create meaningful benefits for many\nnoncitizens going forward, and it is not likely to create benefits\nfor many noncitizens looking backwards. And it will impose serious\nadministrative burdens on an immigration system that is already\noverburdened, thereby harming other noncitizens.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*As a matter of policy, one may reasonably\ndebate the circumstances under which a noncitizen who is unlawfully\nin the country should be removed and should be eligible for\ncancellation of removal. But those policy choices are for the\npolitical branches. Our job is to follow the law passed by Congress\nand signed by the President.The statute here requires the Government to\nserve the noncitizen with written notice of the charges and other\nrequired information, including the time and place of the hearing.\nIn this case, Niz-Chavez received written notice of the charges and\nall the required information, including the time and place of his\nhearing. Niz-Chavez appeared with counsel at his hearing in Detroit\non June 25, 2013. Because he received written notice to appear\nbefore he had accumulated 10 years of continuous physical presence,\nhe is not eligible for cancellation of removal. I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1As relevant here, the statute\nprovides: \u201cFor purposes of this section, any period of continuous\nresidence or continuous physical presence in the United States\nshall be deemed to end . . . when the alien is served a notice to\nappear under section 1229(a) of this title.\u201d\n\u00a71229b(d)(1).2Section 1229(a)(1)\nprovides: \u201cIn removal proceedings under section 1229a of this\ntitle, written notice (in this section referred to as a \u2018notice to\nappear\u2019) shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal\nservice is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or\nto the alien\u2019s counsel of record, if any) specifying the following:\n\u201c(A) The nature of the proceedings against the alien. \u201c(B) The\nlegal authority under which the proceedings are conducted. \u201c(C) The\nacts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law. \u201c(D) The charges\nagainst the alien and the statutory provisions alleged to have been\nviolated. \u201c(E) The alien may be represented by counsel and the\nalien will be provided (i) a period of time to secure counsel under\nsubsection (b)(1) and (ii) a current list of counsel prepared under\nsubsection (b)(2). \u201c(F)(i) The requirement that the alien must\nimmediately provide (or have provided) the Attorney General with a\nwritten record of an address and telephone number (if any) at which\nthe alien may be contacted respecting proceedings under section\n1229a of this title. \u201c(ii) The requirement that the alien must\nprovide the Attorney General immediately with a written record of\nany change of the alien\u2019s address or telephone number. \u201c(iii) The\nconsequences under section 1229a(b)(5) of this title of failure to\nprovide address and telephone information pursuant to this\nsubparagraph. \u201c(G)(i) The time and place at which the proceedings\nwill be held. \u201c(ii) The consequences under section 1229a(b)(5) of\nthis title of the failure, except under exceptional circumstances,\nto appear at such proceedings.\u201d3The Court says that the\nimmigration policy advocates who filedamicusbriefs in\nsupport of Niz-Chavez disagree with that assessment of the\nconsequences of today\u2019s decision. But those briefs are especially\nconcerned with the Government stopping the clock with a notice that\nhas a placeholder date and then sending a later document with the\nactual date. See,e.g.,Brief for American Immigration\nLawyers Association et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae15\u201319; Brief\nfor Thirty-Three Former Immigration Judges and Members of the Board\nof Immigration Appeals asAmici Curiae18\u201323. Yet as counsel\nfor Niz-Chavez forthrightly conceded at oral argument, the approach\nadopted by the Court today will still allow that practice going\nforward. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.",
