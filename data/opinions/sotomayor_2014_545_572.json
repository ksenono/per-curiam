ICON HEALTH\n& FITNESS, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit[April 29, 2014]Justice Sotomayor\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.[1]*Section 285 of the\nPatent Act authorizes a district court to award attorney\u2019s\nfees in patent litigation. It provides, in its entirety, that\n\u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable\nattorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\u2019l,\nInc., 393 F.\u00a03d 1378 (2005), the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit held that \u201c[a] case may be\ndeemed exceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 only in two limited\ncircumstances: \u201cwhen there has been some material\ninappropriate conduct,\u201d or when the litigation is both\n\u201cbrought in subjective bad faith\u201d and\n\u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d Id., at 1381. The question\nbefore us is whether the Brooks Furniture framework is consistent\nwith the statutory text. We hold that it is not.IAPrior to 1946, the\nPatent Act did not authorize the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees\nto the prevailing party in patent litigation. Rather, the\n\u201cAmerican Rule\u201d governed: \u201c\u00a0\u2018[E]ach\nlitigant pa[id] his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or\nlose\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Marx v.\nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at\n9). In 1946, Congress amended the Patent Act to add a discretionary\nfee-shifting provision, then codified in \u00a770, which stated\nthat a court \u201cmay in its discretion award reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party upon the entry of\njudgment in any patent case.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a770\n(1946 ed.).[2]Courts did not award\nfees under \u00a770 as a matter of course. They viewed the award of\nfees not \u201cas a penalty for failure to win a patent\ninfringement suit,\u201d but as appropriate \u201conly in\nextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Park-In-Theatres, Inc. v.\nPerkins, 190 F.\u00a02d 137, 142 (CA9 1951). The provision enabled\nthem to address \u201cunfairness or bad faith in the conduct of\nthe losing party, or some other equitable consideration of similar\nforce,\u201d which made a case so unusual as to warrant\nfee-shifting. Ibid.; see also Pennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem\nSteel Co., 193 F. 2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as\n\u201cadequate justification[s]\u201d for fee awards \u201cfraud\npracticed on the Patent Office or vexatious or unjustified\nlitigation\u201d).Six years later,\nCongress amended the fee-shifting provision and recodified it as\n\u00a7285. Whereas \u00a770 had specified that a district court\ncould \u201cin its discretion award reasonable attorney\u2019s\nfees to the prevailing party,\u201d the revised language of\n\u00a7285 (which remains in force today) provides that \u201c[t]he\ncourt in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to\nthe prevailing party.\u201d We have observed, in interpreting the\ndamages provision of the Patent Act, that the addition of the\nphrase \u201cexceptional cases\u201d to \u00a7285 was \u201cfor\npurposes of clarification only.\u201d[3] General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.\u00a0S. 648\n, n.\u00a08 (1983); see also id., at 652, n. 6. And the parties\nagree that the recodification did not substantively alter the\nmeaning of the statute.[4]For three decades after\nthe enactment of \u00a7285, courts applied it\u2014as they had\napplied \u00a770\u2014in a discretionary manner, assessing various\nfactors to determine whether a given case was sufficiently\n\u201cexceptional\u201d to warrant a fee award. See, e.g., True\nTemper Corp. v. CF&I Steel Corp., 601 F.\u00a02d 495,\n508\u2013509 (CA10 1979); Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Giddings\n& Lewis, Inc., 452 F.\u00a02d 579, 597 (CA7 1971); Siebring v.\nHansen, 346 F.\u00a02d 474, 480\u2013481 (CA8 1965).In 1982, Congress\ncreated the Federal Circuit and vested it with exclusive appellate\njurisdiction in patent cases. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71295. In\nthe two decades that followed, the Federal Circuit, like the\nregional circuits before it, instructed district courts to consider\nthe totality of the circumstances when making fee determinations\nunder \u00a7285. See, e.g., Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical\nCo., 736 F.\u00a02d 688, 691 (1984) (\u201cCases decided under\n\u00a7285 have noted that \u2018the substitution of the phrase\n\u201cin exceptional cases\u201d has not done away with the\ndiscretionary feature\u2019\u00a0\u201d); Yamanouchi\nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 231 F.\u00a03d\n1339, 1347 (2000) (\u201cIn assessing whether a case qualifies as\nexceptional, the district court must look at the totality of the\ncircumstances\u201d).In 2005, however, the\nFederal Circuit abandoned that holistic, equitable approach in\nfavor of a more rigid and mechanical formulation. In Brooks\nFurniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\u2019l, Inc., 393 F.\u00a03d\n1378 (2005), the court held that a case is\n\u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7285 only \u201cwhen there\nhas been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter\nin litigation, such as willful infringement, fraud or inequitable\nconduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during litigation,\nvexatious or unjustified litigation, conduct that violates Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 11, or like infractions.\u201d Id., at 1381. \u201cAbsent\nmisconduct in conduct of the litigation or in securing the\npatent,\u201d the Federal Circuit continued, fees \u201cmay be\nimposed against the patentee only if both (1)\u00a0the litigation\nis brought in subjective bad faith, and (2)\u00a0the litigation is\nobjectively baseless.\u201d Ibid. The Federal Circuit subsequently\nclarified that litigation is objectively baseless only if it is\n\u201cso unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it\nwould succeed,\u201d iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., 631 F.\u00a03d\n1372, 1378 (2011), and that litigation is brought in subjective bad\nfaith only if the plaintiff \u201cactually know[s]\u201d that it\nis objectively baseless, id., at 1377.[5]Finally, Brooks\nFurniture held that because \u201c[t]here is a presumption that\nthe assertion of infringement of a duly granted patent is made in\ngood faith[,] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the underlying improper conduct and\nthe characterization of the case as exceptional must be established\nby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 393 F.\u00a03d, at\n1382.BThe parties to this\nlitigation are manufacturers of exercise equipment. The respondent,\nICON Health & Fitness, Inc., owns U.\u00a0S. Patent No.\n6,019,710 (\u2019710 patent), which discloses an elliptical\nexercise machine that allows for adjustments to fit the individual\nstride paths of users. ICON is a major manufacturer of exercise\nequipment, but it has never commercially sold the machine disclosed\nin the \u2019710 patent. The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also\nmanufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical machines\nknown as the Q45 and Q47.ICON sued Octane,\nalleging that the Q45 and Q47 infringed several claims of the\n\u2019710 patent. The District Court granted Octane\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment, concluding that Octane\u2019s machines did\nnot infringe ICON\u2019s patent. 2011 WL 2457914 (D Minn., June\n17, 2011). Octane then moved for attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a7285. Applying the Brooks Furniture standard, the District\nCourt denied Octane\u2019s motion. 2011 WL 3900975 (D Minn., Sept.\n6, 2011). It determined that Octane could show neither that\nICON\u2019s claim was objectively baseless nor that ICON had\nbrought it in subjective bad faith. As to objective baselessness,\nthe District Court rejected Octane\u2019s argument that the\njudgment of noninfringement \u201cshould have been a foregone\nconclusion to anyone who visually inspected\u201d Octane\u2019s\nmachines. Id., *2. The court explained that although it had\nrejected ICON\u2019s infringement arguments, they were neither\n\u201cfrivolous\u201d nor \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d\nId., *2\u2013*3. The court also found no subjective bad faith on\nICON\u2019s part, dismissing as insufficient both \u201cthe fact\nthat [ICON] is a bigger company which never commercialized the\n\u2019710 patent\u201d and an e-mail exchange between two ICON\nsales executives, which Octane had offered as evidence that ICON\nhad brought the infringement action \u201cas a matter of\ncommercial strategy.\u201d[6]\nId., *4.ICON appealed the\njudgment of noninfringement, and Octane cross-appealed the denial\nof attorney\u2019s fees. The Federal Circuit affirmed both orders.\n496 Fed. Appx. 57 (2012). In upholding the denial of\nattorney\u2019s fees, it rejected Octane\u2019s argument that the\nDistrict Court had \u201capplied an overly restrictive standard in\nrefusing to find the case exceptional under \u00a7285.\u201d Id.,\nat 65. The Federal Circuit declined to \u201crevisit the settled\nstandard for exceptionality.\u201d Ibid.We granted certiorari,\n570 U.\u00a0S. __ (2013), and now reverse.IIThe framework\nestablished by the Federal Circuit in Brooks Furniture is unduly\nrigid, and it impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of\ndiscretion to district courts.AOur analysis begins\nand ends with the text of \u00a7285: \u201cThe court in\nexceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the\nprevailing party.\u201d This text is patently clear. It imposes\none and only one constraint on district courts\u2019 discretion to\naward attorney\u2019s fees in patent litigation: The power is\nreserved for \u201cexceptional\u201d cases.The Patent Act does not\ndefine \u201cexceptional,\u201d so we construe it\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018in accordance with [its] ordinary\nmeaning.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 6); see also Bilski v. Kappos, 561\nU.\u00a0S. 593 , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6) (\u201cIn patent law,\nas in all statutory construction, \u2018[u]nless otherwise\ndefined, \u201cwords will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d). In\n1952, when Congress used the word in \u00a7285 (and today, for that\nmatter), \u201c[e]xceptional\u201d meant \u201cuncommon,\u201d\n\u201crare,\u201d or \u201cnot ordinary.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934); see also 3 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 374 (1933) (defining \u201cexceptional\u201d\nas \u201cout of the ordinary course,\u201d \u201cunusual,\u201d\nor \u201cspecial\u201d);Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate\nDictionary 435 (11th ed. 2008) (defining \u201cexceptional\u201d\nas \u201crare\u201d); Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que\nRestaurant, 771 F.\u00a02d 521, 526 (CADC 1985) (R.\u00a0B.\nGinsburg, J., joined by Scalia, J.) (interpreting the term\n\u201cexceptional\u201d in the Lanham Act\u2019s identical\nfee-shifting provision, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71117(a), to\nmean \u201cuncommon\u201d or \u201cnot\nrun-of-the-mill\u201d).We hold, then, that an\n\u201cexceptional\u201d case is simply one that stands out from\nothers with respect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s\nlitigating position (considering both the governing law and the\nfacts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was\nlitigated. District courts may determine whether a case is\n\u201cexceptional\u201d in the case-by-case exercise of their\ndiscretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.[7] As in the comparable context of the\nCopyright Act, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]here is no precise rule or\nformula for making these determinations,\u2019 but instead\nequitable discretion should be exercised \u2018in light of the\nconsiderations we have identified.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Fogerty v.\nFantasy, Inc., 510 U.\u00a0S. 517, 534 (1994) .B1The Federal\nCircuit\u2019s formulation is overly rigid. Under the standard\ncrafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d\nonly if a district court either finds litigation-related misconduct\nof an independently sanctionable magnitude or determines that the\nlitigation was both \u201cbrought in subjective bad faith\u201d\nand \u201cobjectively baseless.\u201d 393 F.\u00a03d, at 1381.\nThis formulation superimposes an inflexible framework onto\nstatutory text that is inherently flexible.For one thing, the\nfirst category of cases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee\nawards\u2014those involving litigation misconduct or certain other\nmisconduct\u2014appears to extend largely to independently\nsanctionable conduct. See ibid. (defining litigation-related\nmisconduct to include \u201cwillful infringement, fraud or\ninequitable conduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during\nlitigation, vexa-tious or unjustified litigation, conduct that\nviolates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like infractions\u201d). But\nsanctionable conduct is not the appropriate benchmark. Under the\nstandard announced today, a district court may award fees in the\nrare case in which a party\u2019s unreasonable conduct\u2014while\nnot necessarily independently sanctionable\u2014is nonetheless so\n\u201cexceptional\u201d as to justify an award of fees.The second category of\ncases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee awards is also too\nrestrictive. In order for a case to fall within this second\ncategory, a district court must determine both that the litigation\nis objectively baseless and that the plaintiff brought it in\nsubjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad\nfaith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself\napart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf. Noxell, 771\nF. 2d, at 526 (\u201c[W]e think it fair to assume that Congress\ndid not intend rigidly to limit recovery of fees by a [Lanham Act]\ndefendant to the rare case in which a court finds that the\nplaintiff \u2018acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for\noppressive reasons\u2019\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Something\nless than \u2018bad faith,\u2019 we believe, suffices to mark a\ncase as \u2018exceptional\u2019\u00a0\u201d).ICON argues that the\ndual requirement of \u201csubjective bad faith\u201d and\n\u201cobjective baselessness\u201d follows from this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.\u00a0S. 49 (1993)\n(PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine\nof antitrust law. It does not. Under the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine\u2014established by Eastern Railroad Presidents\nConference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.\u00a0S. 127 (1961)\n, and Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.\u00a0S. 657 (1965)\n\u2014defendants are immune from antitrust liability for engaging\nin conduct (including litigation) aimed at influencing\ndecisionmaking by the government. PRE, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 56. But\nunder a \u201csham exception\u201d to this doctrine,\n\u201cactivity \u2018ostensibly directed toward influencing\ngovernmental action\u2019 does not qualify for Noerr immunity if\nit \u2018is a mere sham to cover .\u00a0.\u00a0. an attempt to\ninterfere directly with the business relationships of a\ncompetitor.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 51. In PRE, we held that to\nqualify as a \u201csham,\u201d a \u201clawsuit must be\nobjectively baseless\u201d and must \u201cconcea[l] \u2018an\nattempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a\ncompetitor .\u00a0.\u00a0. .\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at\n60\u201361 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff must\nhave brought baseless claims in an attempt to thwart competition\n(i.e., in bad faith).In Brooks Furniture,\nthe Federal Circuit imported the PRE standard into \u00a7285. See\n393 F.\u00a03d, at 1381. But the PRE standard finds no roots in the\ntext of \u00a7285, and it makes little sense in the context of\ndetermining whether a case is so \u201cexceptional\u201d as to\njustify an award of attorney\u2019s fees in patent litigation. We\ncrafted the Noerr-Pennington doctrine\u2014and carved out only a\nnarrow exception for \u201csham\u201d litigation\u2014to avoid\nchilling the exercise of the First Amendment right to petition the\ngovernment for the redress of grievances. See PRE, 508 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 56 (\u201cThose who petition government for redress are\ngenerally immune from antitrust liability\u201d). But to the\nextent that patent suits are similarly protected as acts of\npetitioning, it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an\n\u201cexceptional\u201d case would diminish that right. The\nthreat of antitrust liability (and the attendant treble damages, 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a715) far more significantly chills the\nexercise of the right to petition than does the mere shifting of\nattorney\u2019s fees. In the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants\nseek immunity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a\nlawsuit was actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a far\nless onerous declaration that they should bear the costs of that\nlawsuit in exceptional cases.2We reject Brooks\nFurniture for another reason: It is so demanding that it would\nappear to render \u00a7285 largely superfluous. We have long\nrecognized a common-law exception to the general \u201cAmerican\nrule\u201d against fee-shifting\u2014an exception,\n\u201cinherent\u201d in the \u201cpower [of] the courts\u201d\nthat applies for \u201c\u00a0\u2018willful disobedience of a\ncourt order\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201cwhen the losing party has\n\u2018acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive\nreasons .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Alyeska Pipeline\nService Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.\u00a0S. 240 \u2013259\n(1975). We have twice declined to construe fee-shifting provisions\nnarrowly on the basis that doing so would render them superfluous,\ngiven the background exception to the American rule, see\nChristiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.\u00a0S. 412, 419 (1978)\n; Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.\u00a0S. 400 ,\nn.\u00a04 (1968) (per curiam), and we again decline to do so\nhere.3Finally, we reject\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s requirement that patent litigants\nestablish their entitlement to fees under \u00a7285 by \u201cclear\nand convincing evidence,\u201d Brooks Furniture, 393 F.\u00a03d,\nat 1382. We have not interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes\nto require proof of entitlement to fees by clear and convincing\nevidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 519; Cooter &\nGell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384 (1990) ; Pierce v. Underwood,\n487 U.\u00a0S. 552, 558 (1988) . And nothing in \u00a7285 justifies\nsuch a high standard of proof. Section 285 demands a simple\ndiscretionary inquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden,\nmuch less such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litigation\nhas always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard, see, e.g., B\u00e9n\u00e9 v. Jeantet, 129 U.\u00a0S.\n683, 688 (1889) , and that is the \u201cstandard generally\napplicable in civil actions,\u201d because it \u201callows both\nparties to \u2018share the risk of error in roughly equal\nfashion,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston,\n459 U.\u00a0S. 375, 390 (1983) .*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing\nreasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0 joins this opinion\nexcept as to footnotes 1\u20133.2This provision did\n\u201cnot contemplat[e] that the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees\n[would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits .\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d S.

Congress explained that \u00a7285\n\u2018is substantially the same as the corresponding provision\nin\u2019 \u00a770\u201d).5In v. , 738 F.\u00a03d\n1302 (CA Fed 2013)\u2014decided after our grant of certiorari but\nbefore we heard oral argument in this case\u2014the Federal\nCircuit appeared to cut back on the \u201csubjective bad\nfaith\u201d inquiry, holding that the language in was dictum and\nthat \u201cactual knowledge of baselessness is not\nrequired.\u201d 738 F. 3d, at 1310. Rather, the court held,\n\u201ca defendant need only prove reckless conduct to satisfy the\nsubjective component of the \u00a7285 analysis,\u201d , and courts\nmay \u201cdra[w] an inference of bad faith from circumstantial\nevidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that are devoid of\nmerit,\u201d at 1311. Most importantly, the Federal Circuit stated\nthat \u201c[o]bjective baselessness alone can create a sufficient\ninference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under \u00a7285,\nunless the circumstances as a whole show a lack of recklessness on\nthe patentee\u2019s part.\u201d , at 1314. Chief Judge Rader\nwrote a concurring opinion that sharply criticized , 738\nF.\u00a03d, at 1318\u20131320; the court, he said, \u201cshould\nhave remained true to its original reading of\u201d \u00a7285, at\n1320.6One e-mail, sent from\nICON\u2019s Vice President of Global Sales to two employees, read:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018We are suing Octane. Not only are we coming out\nwith a greater product to go after them, but throwing a lawsuit on\ntop of that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 2011 WL 3900975, *4. One of the\nrecipients then forwarded that e-mail to a third party, along with\nthe accompanying message: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Just clearing the way\nand making sure you guys have all your guns\nloaded!\u2019\u00a0\u201d . More than a year later, that same\nemployee sent ane-mail to the Vice President of Global Sales with\nthe subject, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I heard we are suing\nOctane!\u2019\u00a0\u201d The executive responded as follows:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Yes\u2014old patent we had for a long time\nthat was sitting on the shelf. They are just looking for\nroyalties.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The District Court wrote that\n\u201cin the light most favorable to Octane, these remarks are\nstray comments by employees with no demonstrated connection to the\nlawsuit.\u201d7In v. , , for example, we\nexplained that in determining whether to award fees under a similar\nprovision in the Copyright Act, district courts could consider a\n\u201cnonexclusive\u201d list of \u201cfactors,\u201d including\n\u201cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both\nin the factual and legal components of the case) and the need in\nparticular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation\nand deterrence.\u201d , at 534, n. 19 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).",
