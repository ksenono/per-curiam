    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u20131657_________________MISSION PRODUCT HOLDINGS, INC., PETITIONERv.TEMPNOLOGY, LLC, nka OLD COLD LLCon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit[May 20, 2019]Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.This Court is not in the business of deciding\nabstract questions, no matter how interesting. Under the\nConstitution, our power extends only to deciding \u201cCases\u201d and\n\u201cControversies\u201d where the outcome matters to real parties in the\nreal world. Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72. Because it\u2019s unclear whether we have\nanything like that here, I would dismiss the petition as\nimprovidently granted.This case began when Mission licensed the right\nto use certain of Tempnology\u2019s trademarks. After Tempnology entered\nbankruptcy, it sought and won from a bankruptcy court an order\ndeclaring that Mission could no longer use those trademarks. On\nappeal and now in this Court, Mission seeks a ruling that the\nbankruptcy court\u2019s declaration was wrong. But whoever is right\nabout that, it isn\u2019t clear how it would make a difference: After\nthe bank-ruptcy court ruled, the license agreement expired by its\nown terms, so nothing we might say here could restore Mission\u2019s\nability to use Tempnology\u2019s trademarks.Recognizing that its original case seems to have\nbecome moot, Mission attempts an alternative theory in briefing\nbefore us. Now Mission says that if it prevails here it will, on\nremand, seek money damages from Tempnology\u2019s estate for the profits\nit lost when, out of respect for the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, it\nrefrained from using the trademarks while its license still\nexisted.But it\u2019s far from clear whether even this theory\ncan keep the case alive. A damages claim \u201csuffices to avoid\nmootness only if viable,\u201d which means damages must at least be\n\u201clegally available for [the alleged] wrong.\u201d 13C C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73533.3, p.\n22 (3d ed. 2008). Yet, as far as Mission has told us, Tempnology\ndid nothing that could lawfully give rise to a damages claim. After\nall, when Tempnology asked the bankruptcy court to issue a\ndeclaratory ruling on a question of law, it was exercising its\nprotected \u201c First Amendment right to petition the Government for\nredress of grievances.\u201dBill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc.v.NLRB,461 U.S.\n731, 741 (1983). And petitioning a court normally isn\u2019t an\nactionable wrong that can give rise to a claim for damages. Absent\na claim of malice (which Mission hasn\u2019t suggested would have any\nbasis here), the ordinary rule is that \u201c\u00a0\u2018no action lies\nagainst a party for resort to civil courts\u2019\u00a0\u201d or for \u201cthe\nassertion of a legal argument.\u201dLucsikv.Board of Ed. of\nBrunswick City School Dist., 621 F.2d 841, 842 (CA6 1980)\n(per curiam); see,e.g.,W.\u00a0R. Grace &\nCo.v.Rubber Workers,461 U.S.\n757, 770, n.\u00a014 (1983);Russellv.Farley,105 U.S.\n433, 437\u2013438 (1882).Maybe Mission\u2019s able lawyers will conjure\nsomething better on remand. But, so far at least, the company\nhasn\u2019t come close to articulating a viable legal theory on which a\nclaim for damages could succeed. And where our jurisdiction is so\nmuch in doubt, I would decline to proceed to the merits. If the\nlegal questions here are of sufficient importance, a live case\npresenting them will come along soon enough; there is no need to\npress the bounds of our constitutional authority to reach them\ntoday.",
