TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.HAWAII, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 26, 2018]Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg\njoins, dissenting.The United States of America is a Nation built\nupon the promise of religious liberty. Our Founders honored that\ncore promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in\nthe First Amendment. The Court\u2019s decision today fails to safeguard\nthat fundamental principle. It leaves undisturbed a policy first\nadvertised openly and unequivocally as a \u201ctotal and complete\nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d because the policy\nnow masquerades behind a fa\u00e7ade of national-security concerns. But\nthis repackaging does little to cleanse Presidential Proclamation\nNo. 9645 of the appearance of discrimination that the President\u2019s\nwords have created. Based on the evidence in the record, a\nreasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was\nmotivated by anti-Muslim animus. That alone suffices to show that\nplaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nEstablishment Clause claim. The majority holds otherwise by\nignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning\na blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts\nupon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United\nStates citizens. Because that troubling result runs contrary to the\nConstitution and our precedent, I dissent.IPlaintiffs challenge the Proclamation on\nvarious grounds, both statutory and constitutional. Ordinarily,\nwhen a case can be decided on purely statutory grounds, we strive\nto follow a \u201cprudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions.\u201dZobrestv.Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509\nU.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (1993). But that rule of thumb is far from\ncategorical, and it has limited application where, as here, the\nconstitutional question proves far simpler than the statutory one.\nWhatever the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 complex statutory claims, the\nProclamation must be enjoined for a more fundamental reason: It\nruns afoul of the Establishment Clause\u2019s guarantee of religious\nneutrality.AThe Establishment Clause forbids government\npolicies \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d U.\u00a0S.\nConst., Amdt. 1.

Consistent with\nthat clear command, this Court has long acknowledged that\ngovernmental actions that favor one religion \u201cinevitabl[y]\u201d foster\n\u201cthe hatred, disrespect and even contempt of those who [hold]\ncontrary beliefs.\u201dEngelv.Vitale, 370 U.\u00a0S.\n421, 431 (1962). That is so, this Court has held, because such acts\nsend messages to members of minority faiths \u201c\u00a0\u2018that they are\noutsiders, not full members of the political community.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSanta\u00a0Fe Independent School Dist.v.Doe, 530\nU.\u00a0S. 290, 309 (2000).

To determine whether plaintiffs have\nproved an Establishment Clause violation, the Court asks whether a\nreasonable observer would view the government action as enacted for\nthe purpose of disfavoring a religion. Seeid., at 862, 866;\naccord,Town of Greecev.Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2014) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 19).In answering that question, this Court has\ngenerally considered the text of the government policy, its\noperation, and any available evidence regarding \u201cthe historical\nbackground of the decision under challenge, the specific series of\nevents leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and\nthe legislative or administrative history, including\ncontemporaneous statements made by\u201d the decisionmaker.Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 540 (opinion of Kennedy, J.);McCreary, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 862 (courts must evaluate\n\u201ctext, legislative history, and implementation\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or comparable official act\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). At the same time, however, courts must\ntake care not to engage in \u201cany judicial psychoanalysis of a\ndrafter\u2019s heart of hearts.\u201dId., at 862.B1Although the majority briefly recounts a few\nof the statements and background events that form the basis of\nplaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge,ante,at 27\u201328, that\nhighly abridged account does not tell even half of the story. See\nBrief for The Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center asAmicus Curiae5\u201331 (outlining President Trump\u2019s public\nstatements expressing animus toward Islam). The full record paints\na far more harrowing picture, from which a reasonable observer\nwould readily conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by\nhostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.During his Presidential campaign, then-candidate\nDonald Trump pledged that, if elected, he would ban Muslims from\nentering the United States. Specifically, on December 7, 2015, he\nissued a formal statement \u201ccalling for a total and complete\nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d App. 119. That\nstatement, which remained on his campaign website until May 2017\n(several months into his Presidency), read in full:\u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and\ncomplete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our\ncountry\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\nAccording to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred\ntowards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most\nrecently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data\nshowing \u201825% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans\nhere in the United States is justified as a part of the global\njihad\u2019 and 51% of those polled \u2018agreed that Muslims in America\nshould have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\u2019\nShariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against nonbelievers\nwho won\u2019t convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose\ngreat harm to Americans, especially women.\u201cMr. Trum[p] stated, \u2018Without looking at the\nvarious polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond\ncomprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to\ndetermine. Until we are able to determine and understand this\nproblem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be\nthe victims of the horrendous attacks by people that believe only\nin Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect of human life. If\nI win the election for President, we are going to Make America\nGreat Again.\u2019\u2014Donald J. Trump.\u201dId., at 158; see alsoid., at 130\u2013131.On December 8, 2015, Trump justified his\nproposal during a television interview by noting that President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt \u201cdid the same thing\u201d with respect to the\ninternment of Japanese Americans during World War II.Id.,\nat 120. In January 2016, during a Republican primary debate, Trump\nwas asked whether he wanted to \u201crethink [\u00a0his] position\u201d on\n\u201cbanning Muslims from entering the country.\u201dIbid.He\nanswered, \u201cNo.\u201dIbid.A month later, at a rally in South\nCarolina, Trump told an apocryphal story about United States\nGeneral John J. Pershing killing a large group of Muslim insurgents\nin the Philippines with bullets dipped in pigs\u2019 blood in the early\n1900\u2019s.Id., at 163\u2013164. In March 2016, he expressed his\nbelief that \u201cIslam hates us. .\u00a0.\u00a0. [W]e can\u2019t allow\npeople coming into this country who have this hatred of the United\nStates .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a]nd of people that are not Muslim.\u201dId.,at 120\u2013121. That same month, Trump asserted that\n\u201c[w]e\u2019re having problems with the Muslims, and we\u2019re having\nproblems with Muslims coming into the country.\u201dId., at 121.\nHe therefore called for surveillance of mosques in the United\nStates, blaming terrorist attacks on Muslims\u2019 lack of\n\u201cassimilation\u201d and their commitment to \u201csharia law.\u201dIbid.;id., at 164. A day later, he opined that Muslims \u201cdo not\nrespect us at all\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t respect a lot of the things that are\nhappening throughout not only our country, but they don\u2019t respect\nother things.\u201dIbid.As Trump\u2019s presidential campaign progressed, he\nbegan to describe his policy proposal in slightly different terms.\nIn June 2016, for instance, he characterized the policy proposal as\na suspension of immigration from countries \u201cwhere there\u2019s a proven\nhistory of terrorism.\u201dId., at 121. He also described the\nproposal as rooted in the need to stop \u201cimporting radical Islamic\nterrorism to the West through a failed immigration system.\u201dId., at 121\u2013122. Asked in July 2016 whether he was\n\u201cpull[ing] back from\u201d his pledged Muslim ban, Trump responded, \u201cI\nactually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rollback. In fact, you could say it\u2019s\nan expansion.\u201dId.,at 122\u2013123. He then explained that he\nused different terminology because \u201c[p]eople were so upset when\n[he] used the word Muslim.\u201dId.,at 123.A month before the 2016 election, Trump\nreiterated that his proposed \u201cMuslim ban\u201d had \u201cmorphed into a[n]\nextreme vetting from certain areas of the world.\u201dIbid.Then, on December 21, 2016, President-elect Trump was asked whether\nhe would \u201crethink\u201d his previous \u201cplans to create a Muslim registry\nor ban Muslim immigration.\u201dIbid.He replied: \u201cYou know my\nplans. All along, I\u2019ve proven to be right.\u201dIbid.On January 27, 2017, one week after taking\noffice, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, 82 Fed.\nReg. 8977 (2017) (EO\u20131), entitled \u201cProtecting the Nation From\nForeign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\u201d As he signed it,\nPresident Trump read the title, looked up, and said \u201cWe all know\nwhat that means.\u201d App. 124. That same day, President Trump\nexplained to the media that, under EO\u20131, Christians would be given\nprior- ity for entry as refugees into the United States. In\nparticu- lar, he bemoaned the fact that in the past, \u201c[i]f you were\na Muslim [refugee from Syria] you could come in, but if you were a\nChristian, it was almost impossible.\u201dId.,at 125.\nConsidering that past policy \u201cvery unfair,\u201d President Trump\nexplained that EO\u20131 was designed \u201cto help\u201d the Christians in Syria.Ibid.The following day, one of President Trump\u2019s key\nadvisers candidly drew the connection between EO\u20131 and the \u201cMuslim\nban\u201d that the President had pledged to implement if elected.Ibid.According to that adviser, \u201c[W]hen [Donald Trump]\nfirst announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He\nsaid, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it\nlegally.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.On February 3, 2017, the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Washington enjoined the\nenforcement of EO\u20131. SeeWashingtonv.Trump,2017 WL\n462040, *3. The Ninth Circuit denied the Government\u2019s request to\nstay that injunction.Washingtonv.Trump, 847\nF.\u00a03d 1151, 1169 (2017) (per curiam). Rather than\nappeal the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, the Government declined to\ncontinue defending EO\u20131 in court and instead announced that the\nPresident intended to issue a new executive order to replace\nEO\u20131.On March 6, 2017, President Trump issued that\nnew executive order, which, like its predecessor, imposed temporary\nentry and refugee bans. See Exec. Order No. 13,780, 82 Fed. Reg.\n13209 (EO\u20132). One of the President\u2019s senior advisers publicly\nexplained that EO\u20132 would \u201chave the same basic policy outcome\u201d as\nEO\u20131, and that any changes would address \u201cvery technical issues\nthat were brought up by the court.\u201d App. 127. After EO\u20132 was\nissued, the White House Press Secretary told reporters that, by\nissuing EO\u20132, President Trump \u201ccontinue[d] to deliver on\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. his most significant campaign promises.\u201dId., at 130. That statement was consistent with President\nTrump\u2019s own declaration that \u201cI keep my campaign promises, and our\ncitizens will be very happy when they see the result.\u201dId.,\nat 127\u2013128.Before EO\u20132 took effect, federal District Courts\nin Hawaii and Maryland enjoined the order\u2019s travel and refugee\nbans. SeeHawaiiv.Trump, 245 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1227,\n1239 (Haw. 2017);International Refugee Assistance Project(IRAP) v.Trump, 241 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 539, 566 (Md.\n2017). The Fourth and Ninth Circuits upheld those injunctions in\nsubstantial part.IRAPv.Trump, 857 F.\u00a03d 554,\n606 (CA4 2017) (en banc);Hawaiiv.Trump, 859\nF.\u00a03d 741, 789 (CA9 2017) (per curiam). In June 2017,\nthis Court granted the Government\u2019s petition for certiorari and\nissued aper curiamopinion partially staying the District\nCourts\u2019 injunctions pending further review. In particular, the\nCourt allowed EO\u20132\u2019s travel ban to take effect except as to\n\u201cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide\nrelationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201dTrumpv.IRAP, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 12).While litigation over EO\u20132 was ongoing,\nPresident Trump repeatedly made statements alluding to a desire to\nkeep Muslims out of the country. For instance, he said at a rally\nof his supporters that EO\u20132 was just a \u201cwatered down version of the\nfirst one\u201d and had been \u201ctailor[ed]\u201d at the behest of \u201cthe\nlawyers.\u201d App. 131. He further added that he would prefer \u201cto go\nback to the first [executive order] and go all the way\u201d and\nreiterated his belief that it was \u201cvery hard\u201d for Muslims to\nassimilate into Western culture.Id., at 131\u2013132. During a\nrally in April 2017, President Trump recited the lyrics to a song\ncalled \u201cThe Snake,\u201d a song about a woman who nurses a sick snake\nback to health but then is attacked by the snake, as a warning\nabout Syrian refugees entering the country.Id., at 132,\n163. And in June 2017, the President stated on Twitter that the\nJustice Department had submitted a \u201cwatered down, politically\ncorrect version\u201d of the \u201coriginal Travel Ban\u201d \u201cto\nS[upreme]\u00a0C[ourt].\u201d[1]Id., at 132. The President went on to tweet: \u201cPeople, the\nlawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am\ncalling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201dId.,\nat 132\u2013133. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for\ncertain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that\nwon\u2019t help us protect our people!\u201dId., at 133. Then, on\nAugust 17, 2017, President Trump issued yet another tweet about\nIslam, once more referencing the story about General Pershing\u2019s\nmassacre of Muslims in the Philippines: \u201cStudy what General\nPershing .\u00a0.\u00a0. did to terrorists when caught. There was\nno more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\u201dIRAPv.Trump, 883 F.\u00a03d 233, 267 (CA4 2018) (IRAP II)\n(en banc) (alterations in original).In September 2017, President Trump tweeted that\n\u201c[t]he travel ban into the United States should be far larger,\ntougher and more specific\u2014but stupidly, that would not be\npolitically correct!\u201d App. 133. Later that month, on September 24,\n2017, President Trump issued Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82\nFed. Reg. 45161 (2017) (Proclamation), which restricts entry of\ncertain nationals from six Muslim-majority countries. On November\n29, 2017, President Trump \u201cretweeted\u201d three anti-Muslim videos,\nentitled \u201cMuslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!\u201d, \u201cIslamist mob\npushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!\u201d, and \u201cMuslim\nmigrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\u201d[2]IRAP II, 883 F.\u00a03d, at 267. Those\nvideos were initially tweeted by a British political party whose\nmission is to oppose \u201call alien and destructive politic[al] or\nreligious doctrines, including .\u00a0.\u00a0. Islam.\u201dIbid.When asked about these videos, the White House Deputy Press\nSecretary connected them to the Proclamation, responding that the\n\u201cPresident has been talking about these security issues for years\nnow, from the campaign trail to the White House\u201d and \u201chas addressed\nthese issues with the travel order that he issued earlier this year\nand the companion proclamation.\u201dIbid.2As the majority correctly notes, \u201cthe issue\nbefore us is not whether to denounce\u201d these offensive statements.Ante,at 29. Rather, the dispositive and narrow question\nhere is whether a reasonable observer, presented with all \u201copenly\navailable data,\u201d the text and \u201chistorical context\u201d of the\nProclamation, and the \u201cspecific sequence of events\u201d leading to it,\nwould conclude that the primary purpose of the Proclamation is to\ndisfavor Islam and its adherents by excluding them from the\ncountry. SeeMcCreary, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 862\u2013863. The\nanswer is unquestionably yes.Taking all the relevant evidence together, a\nreasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was driven\nprimarily by anti-Muslim animus, rather than by the Government\u2019s\nasserted national-security justifications. Even before being sworn\ninto office, then-candidate Trump stated that \u201cIslam hates us,\u201d\nApp. 399, warned that \u201c[w]e\u2019re having problems with the Muslims,\nand we\u2019re having problems with Muslims coming into the country,\u201did., at 121, promised to enact a \u201ctotal and complete\nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201did.,at\n119, and instructed one of his advisers to find a \u201clega[l\u00a0]\u201d\nway to enact a Muslim ban,id., at 125.[3] The President continued to make similar\nstatements well after his inauguration, as detailed above, seesupra, at 6\u201310.Moreover, despite several opportunities to do\nso, President Trump has never disavowed any of his prior statements\nabout Islam.[4] Instead, he has\ncontinued to make remarks that a reasonable observer would view as\nan unrelenting attack on the Muslim religion and its followers.\nGiven President Trump\u2019s failure to correct the reasonable\nperception of his apparent hostility toward the Islamic faith, it\nis unsurprising that the President\u2019s lawyers have, at every step in\nthe lower courts, failed in their attempts to launder the\nProclamation of its discriminatory taint. SeeUnited Statesv.Fordice, 505 U.\u00a0S. 717, 746\u2013747 (1992) (\u201c[G]iven an\ninitially tainted policy, it is eminently reasonable to make the\n[Government] bear the risk of nonpersuasion with respect to intent\nat some future time, both because the [Government] has created the\ndispute through its own prior unlawful conduct, and because\ndiscriminatory intent does tend to persist through time\u201d (citation\nomitted)). Notably, the Court recently found less pervasive\nofficial expressions of hostility and the failure to disavow them\nto be constitutionally significant. Cf.Masterpiece Cakeshop,\nLtd.v.Colorado Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, 584 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18) (\u201cThe official expressions of\nhostility to religion in some of the commissioners\u2019\ncomments\u2014comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by\nthe State at any point in the proceedings that led to the\naffirmance of the order\u2014were inconsistent with what the Free\nExercise Clause requires\u201d). It should find the same here.Ultimately, what began as a policy explicitly\n\u201ccalling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the\nUnited States\u201d has since morphed into a \u201cProclamation\u201d putatively\nbased on national-security concerns. But this new window dressing\ncannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the President and\nhis advisers create the strong perception that the Proclamation is\ncontaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam\nand its followers.IIRather than defend the President\u2019s problematic\nstatements, the Government urges this Court to set them aside and\ndefer to the President on issues related to immigration and\nnational security. The majority accepts that invitation and\nincorrectly applies a watered-down legal standard in an effort to\nshort circuit plaintiffs\u2019 Establishment Clause claim.The majority begins its constitutional analysis\nby noting that this Court, at times, \u201chas engaged in a\ncircumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly\nburdens the constitutional rights of a U.\u00a0S. citizen.\u201dAnte,at 30 (citingKleindienstv.Mandel, 408\nU.\u00a0S. 753 (1972)). As the majority notes,Mandelheld\nthat when the Executive Branch provides \u201ca facially legitimate and\nbona fide reason\u201d for denying a visa, \u201ccourts will neither look\nbehind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing\nits justification.\u201dId., at 770. In his controlling\nconcurrence inKerryv.Din, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015), Justice Kennedy appliedMandel\u2019s holding and\nelaborated that courts can \u201c\u00a0\u2018look behind\u2019 the Government\u2019s\nexclusion of\u201d a foreign national if there is \u201can affirmative\nshowing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer who denied\n[the] visa.\u201dDin, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 5). The extent to whichMandelandDinapply at all to this case is unsettled, and there is\ngood reason to think they do not.[5] Indeed, even the Government agreed at oral argument\nthat where the Court confronts a situation involving \u201call kinds of\ndenigrating comments about\u201d a particular religion and a subsequent\npolicy that is designed with the purpose of disfavoring that\nreligion but that \u201cdot[s] all the i\u2019s and .\u00a0.\u00a0. cross[es]\nall the t\u2019s,\u201dMandelwould not \u201cpu[t] an end to judicial\nreview of that set of facts.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.In light of the Government\u2019s suggestion \u201cthat it\nmay be appropriate here for the inquiry to extend beyond the facial\nneutrality of the order,\u201d the majority rightly declines to applyMandel\u2019s \u201cnarrow standard of review\u201d and \u201cassume[s] that we\nmay look behind the face of the Proclamation.\u201dAnte,at\n31\u201332.In doing so, however, the Court, without explanation\nor precedential support, limits its review of the Proclamation to\nrational-basis scrutiny.Ibid.That approach is perplexing,\ngiven that in other Establishment Clause cases, including those\ninvolving claims of religious animus or discrimination, this Court\nhas applied a more stringent standard of review. See,e.g.,McCreary, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 860\u2013863;Larson, 456\nU.\u00a0S., at 246;Presbyterian Church in U.\u00a0S.v.Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church, 393\nU.\u00a0S. 440, 449\u2013452 (1969); see alsoColorado Christian\nUniv.v.Weaver, 534 F.\u00a03d 1245, 1266 (CA10 2008)\n(McConnell, J.) (noting that, under Supreme Court precedent, laws\n\u201cinvolving discrimination on the basis of religion, including\ninterdenominational discrimination, are subject to heightened\nscrutiny whether they arise under the Free Exercise Clause, the\nEstablishment Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause\u201d (citations\nomitted)).[6] As explained\nabove, the Proclamation is plainly unconstitutional under that\nheightened standard. Seesupra,at 10\u201313.But even under rational-basis review, the\nProclamation must fall. That is so because the Proclamation is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018divorced from any factual context from which we could\ndiscern a relationship to legitimate state interests,\u2019 and \u2018its\nsheer breadth [is] so discontinuous with the reasons offered for\nit\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the policy is \u201c\u00a0\u2018inexplicable by anything but\nanimus.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 33 (quotingRomerv.Evans, 517 U.\u00a0S. 620, 632, 635 (1996)); see alsoCleburnev.Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473\nU.\u00a0S. 432, 448 (1985) (recognizing that classifications\npredicated on discriminatory animus can never be legitimate because\nthe Government has no legitimate interest in exploiting \u201cmere\nnegative attitudes, or fear\u201d toward a disfavored group). The\nPresident\u2019s statements, which the majority utterly fails to address\nin its legal analysis, strongly support the conclusion that the\nProclamation was issued to express hostility toward Muslims and\nexclude them from the country. Given the overwhelming record\nevidence of anti-Muslim animus, it sim- ply cannot be said that the\nProclamation has a legitimate basis.IRAP II, 883 F. 3d, at\n352 (Harris, J., concurring) (explaining that the Proclamation\ncontravenes the bedrock principle \u201cthat the government may not act\non the basis ofanimustoward a disfavored religious\nminority\u201d (emphasis in original)).The majority insists that the Proclamation\nfurthers two interrelated national-security interests: \u201cpreventing\nentry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing\nother nations to improve their practices.\u201dAnte,at 34. But\nthe Court offers insufficient support for its view \u201cthat the entry\nsuspension has a legitimate grounding in [those] national security\nconcerns, quite apart from any religious hostility.\u201dIbid.;\nsee alsoante, at 33\u201338, and n.\u00a07. In- deed, even a\ncursory review of the Government\u2019s asserted national-security\nrationale reveals that the Proclamation is nothing more than a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018religious gerrymander.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLukumi, 508\nU.\u00a0S., at 535.The majority first emphasizes that the\nProclamation \u201csays nothing about religion.\u201dAnte,at 34.\nEven so, the Proclamation, just like its predecessors,\noverwhelmingly targets Muslim-majority nations. Given the record\nhere, including all the President\u2019s statements linking the\nProclamation to his apparent hostility toward Muslims, it is of no\nmoment that the Proclamation also includes minor restrictions on\ntwo non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela, or\nthat the Government has removed a few Muslim-majority countries\nfrom the list of covered countries since EO\u20131 was issued.\nConsideration of the entire record supports the conclusion that the\ninclusion of North Korea and Venezuela, and the removal of other\ncountries, simply reflect subtle efforts to start \u201ctalking\nterritory instead of Muslim,\u201d App. 123, precisely so the Executive\nBranch could evade criticism or legal consequences for the\nProclamation\u2019s otherwise clear targeting of Muslims. The\nProclamation\u2019s effect on North Korea and Venezuela, for example, is\ninsubstantial, if not entirely symbolic. A prior sanctions order\nalready restricts entry of North Korean nationals, see Exec. Order\nNo. 13810, 82 Fed. Reg. 44705 (2017), and the Proclamation targets\nonly a handful of Venezuelan government officials and their\nimmediate family members, 82 Fed. Reg. 45166. As such, the\nPresident\u2019s inclusion of North Korea and Venezuela does little to\nmitigate the anti-Muslim animus that permeates the\nProclamation.The majority next contends that the Proclamation\n\u201creflects the results of a worldwide review process under- taken by\nmultiple Cabinet officials.\u201dAnte,at 34. At the out- set,\nthere is some evidence that at least one of the individuals\ninvolved in that process may have exhibited bias against Muslims.\nAs noted by one group ofamici, the Trump administration\nappointed Frank Wuco to help enforce the President\u2019s travel bans\nand lead the multi- agency review process. See Brief for Plaintiffs\ninInternational Refugee Assistance Projectv.TrumpasAmici Cu- riae13\u201314, and n.\u00a010. According toamici, Wuco has purportedly made several suspect public\nstatements about Islam: He has \u201cpublicly declared that it was a\n\u2018great idea\u2019 to \u2018stop the visa application process into this\ncountry from Muslim nations in a blanket type of policy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cthat Muslim populations \u2018living under other-than-Muslim rule\u2019 will\n\u2018necessarily\u2019 turn to violence, that Islam prescribes \u2018violence and\nwarfare against unbelievers,\u2019 and that Muslims \u2018by-and-large\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. resist assimilation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 14.But, even setting aside those comments, the\nworldwide review does little to break the clear connection between\nthe Proclamation and the President\u2019s anti-Muslim statements. For\n\u201c[n]o matter how many officials affix their names to it, the\nProclamation rests on a rotten foundation.\u201d Brief for\nConstitutional Law Scholars asAmici Curiae7 (filed Apr. 2,\n2018); seesupra, at 4\u201310. The President campaigned on a\npromise to implement a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d\nentering the country, translated that campaign promise into a\nconcrete policy, and made several statements linking that policy\n(in its various forms) to anti-Muslim animus.Ignoring all this, the majority empowers the\nPresident to hide behind an administrative review process that the\nGovernment refuses to disclose to the public. SeeIRAP II,\n883 F.\u00a03d, at 268 (\u201c[T]he Government chose not to make the\nreview publicly available\u201d even in redacted form);IRAPv.Trump, No. 17\u20132231 (CA4), Doc. 126 (Letter from S. Swingle,\nCounsel for Defendants-Appellants, to P. Connor, Clerk of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Nov. 24,\n2017)) (resisting Fourth Circuit\u2019s request that the Government\nsupplement the record with the reports referenced in the\nProclamation). Furthermore, evidence of which we can take judicial\nnotice indicates that the multiagency review process could not have\nbeen very thorough. Ongoing litigation under the Freedom of\nInformation Act shows that the September 2017 report the Government\nproduced after its review process was a mere 17 pages. SeeBrennan Center for Justicev.United\u00a0States Dept. of\nState, No. 17\u2013cv\u20137520 (SDNY), Doc. No. 31\u20131, pp. 2\u20133. That the\nGovernment\u2019s analysis of the vetting practices of hundreds of\ncountries boiled down to such a short document raises serious\nquestions about the legitimacy of the President\u2019s proclaimed\nnational-security rationale.Beyond that, Congress has already addressed the\nnational-security concerns supposedly undergirding the Proclamation\nthrough an \u201cextensive and complex\u201d framework governing \u201cimmigration\nand alien status.\u201dArizonav.United States, 567\nU.\u00a0S. 387, 395 (2012).[7]\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act sets forth, in painstaking\ndetail, a reticulated scheme regulating the admission of\nindividuals to the United States.

To determine which countries are eligible for the Visa\nWaiver Program, the Government considers whether they can satisfy\nnumerous criteria\u2014e.g.,using electronic, fraud-resistant\npassports, \u00a71187(a)(3)(B), 24-hour reporting of lost or stolen\npassports, \u00a71187(c)(2)(D), and not providing a safe haven for\nterrorists, \u00a71187(a)(12)(D)(iii). The Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity, in consultation with the Secretary of State, also must\ndetermine that a country\u2019s inclusion in the program will not\ncompromise \u201cthe law enforcement and security interests of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a71187(c)(2)(C). Eligibility for the program is\nreassessed on an annual basis. See \u00a71187(a)(12)(D)(iii),\n1187(c)(12)(A). As a result of a recent review, for example, the\nExecutive decided in 2016 to remove from the program dual nationals\nof Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan. See Brief for Former National\nSecurity Officials asAmici Curiae27.Put simply, Congress has already erected a\nstatutory scheme that fulfills the putative national-security\ninterests the Government now puts forth to justify the\nProclamation. Tellingly, the Government remains wholly unable to\narticulate any credible national-security interest that would go\nunaddressed by the current statutory scheme absent the\nProclamation. The Government also offers no evidence that this\ncurrent vetting scheme, which involves a highly searching\nconsideration of individuals required to obtain visas for entry\ninto the United States and a highly searching consideration of\nwhich countries are eligible for inclusion in the Visa Waiver\nProgram, is inadequate to achieve the Proclamation\u2019s proclaimed\nobjectives of \u201cpreventing entry of nationals who cannot be\nadequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their\n[vetting and information-sharing] practices.\u201dAnte,at\n34.For many of these reasons, several former\nnational-security officials from both political parties\u2014including\nformer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former State\nDepartment Legal Adviser John Bellinger III, former Central\nIntelligence Agency Director John Brennan, and former Director of\nNational Intelligence James Clapper\u2014have advised that the\nProclamation and its predecessor orders \u201cdo not advance the\nnational-security or foreign policy interests of the United States,\nand in fact do serious harm to those interests.\u201d Brief for Former\nNational Security Officials asAmici Curiae15 (boldface\ndeleted).Moreover, the Proclamation purports to mitigate\nnational-security risks by excluding nationals of countries that\nprovide insufficient information to vet their nationals. 82 Fed.\nReg. 45164. Yet, as plaintiffs explain, the Proclamation broadly\ndenies immigrant visas to all nationals of those countries,\nincluding those whose admission would likely not implicate these\ninformation deficiencies (e.g.,infants, or nationals of\ncountries included in the Proclamation who are long-term residents\nof and traveling from a country not covered by the Proclamation).\nSee Brief for Respondents 72. In addition, the Proclamation permits\ncertain nationals from the countries named in the Proclamation to\nobtain nonimmigrant visas, which undermines the Government\u2019s\nassertion that it does not already have the capacity and sufficient\ninformation to vet these individuals adequately. See 82 Fed. Reg.\n45165\u201345169.Equally unavailing is the majority\u2019s reliance on\nthe Proclamation\u2019s waiver program.Ante,at 37, and\nn.\u00a07. As severalamicithoroughly explain, there is\nreason to suspect that the Proclamation\u2019s waiver program is nothing\nmore than a sham. See Brief for Pars Equality Center et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae11, 13\u201328 (explaining that \u201cwaivers under the\nProclamation are vanishingly rare\u201d and reporting numerous stories\nof deserving applicants denied waivers). The remote possibility of\nobtaining a waiver pursuant to an ad\u00a0hoc, discretionary, and\nseemingly arbitrary process scarcely demonstrates that the\nProclamation is rooted in a genuine concern for national security.\nSeeante,at 3\u20138 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (outlining\nevidence suggesting \u201cthat the Government is not applying the\nProclamation as written,\u201d that \u201cwaivers are not being processed in\nan ordinary way,\u201d and that consular and other officials \u201cdo not, in\nfact, have discretion to grant waivers\u201d).In sum, none of the features of the Proclamation\nhighlighted by the majority supports the Government\u2019s claim that\nthe Proclamation is genuinely and primarily rooted in a legitimate\nnational-security interest. What the unrebutted evidence actually\nshows is that a reasonable observer would conclude, quite easily,\nthat the primary purpose and function of the Proclamation is to\ndisfavor Islam by banning Muslims from entering our country.IIIAs the foregoing analysis makes clear,\nplaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nEstablishment Clause claim. To obtain a preliminary injunction,\nhow- ever, plaintiffs must also show that they are \u201clikely to\nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\u201d that\n\u201cthe balance of equities tips in [their] favor,\u201d and that \u201can\ninjunction is in the public interest.\u201dWinterv.Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 7, 20 (2008).\nPlaintiffs readily clear those remaining hurdles.First, plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of\nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. As the District\nCourt found, plaintiffs have adduced substantial evidence showing\nthat the Proclamation will result in \u201ca multitude of harms that are\nnot compensable with monetary dam- ages and that are\nirreparable\u2014among them, prolonged separation from family members,\nconstraints to recruiting and retaining students and faculty\nmembers to foster diversity and quality within the University\ncommunity, and the diminished membership of the [Muslim]\nAssociation.\u201d 265 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1140, 1159 (Haw. 2017).Second, plaintiffs have demonstrated that the\nbalance of the equities tips in their favor. Against plaintiffs\u2019\nconcrete allegations of serious harm, the Government advances only\nnebulous national-security concerns. Although national security is\nunquestionably an issue of paramount public importance, it is not\n\u201ca talisman\u201d that the Government can use \u201cto ward off inconvenient\nclaims\u2014a \u2018label\u2019 used to \u2018cover a multitude of sins.\u2019\u00a0\u201dZiglarv.Abbasi, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017)\n(slip op., at 20). That is especially true here, because, as noted,\nthe Government\u2019s other statutory tools, including the existing\nrigorous individualized vetting process, already address the\nProclamation\u2019s purported national-security concerns. Seesupra,at 19\u201322.Finally, plaintiffs and theiramicihave\nconvincingly established that \u201can injunction is in the public\ninterest.\u201dWinter, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 20. As explained by\nthe scores ofamiciwho have filed briefs in support of\nplaintiffs, the Proclamation has deleterious effects on our higher\neducation system;[8] national\nsecurity;[9]\nhealthcare;[10] artistic\nculture;[11] and the\nNation\u2019s technology industry and overall economy.[12] Accordingly, the Court of Appeals\ncorrectly affirmed, in part, the District Court\u2019s preliminary\ninjunction.[13]IVThe First Amendment stands as a bulwark\nagainst official religious prejudice and embodies our Nation\u2019s deep\ncommitment to religious plurality and tolerance. That\nconstitutional promise is why, \u201c[f\u00a0]or centuries now, people\nhave come to this country from every corner of the world to share\nin the blessing of religious freedom.\u201dTown of Greecev.Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 1). Instead of vindicating those principles, today\u2019s\ndecision tosses them aside. In holding that the First Amendment\ngives way to an executive policy that a reasonable observer would\nview as motivated by animus against Muslims, the majority opinion\nupends this Court\u2019s precedent, repeats tragic mistakes of the past,\nand denies countless individuals the fundamental right of religious\nliberty.Just weeks ago, the Court rendered its decision\ninMasterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, which applied\nthe bedrock principles of religious neutrality and tolerance in\nconsidering a First Amendment challenge to government action. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 17) (\u201cThe Constitution \u2018commits\ngovernment itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight\nsuspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity\nto religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause\nto remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the\nrights it secures\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingLukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 547));Masterpiece, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Kagan, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 1) (\u201c[S]tate actors cannot show hostility\nto religious views; rather, they must give those views \u2018neutral and\nrespectful consideration\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Those principles should apply\nequally here. In both instances, the question is whether a\ngovernment actor exhibited tolerance and neutrality in reaching a\ndecision that affects individuals\u2019 fundamental religious freedom.\nBut unlike inMasterpiece, where a state civil rights\ncommission was found to have acted without \u201cthe neutrality that the\nFree Exercise Clause requires,\u201did.,at ___ (slip op., at\n17), the government actors in this case will not be held\naccountable for breaching the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of\nreligious neutrality and tolerance. Unlike inMasterpiece,\nwhere the majority considered the state commissioners\u2019 statements\nabout religion to be persuasive evidence of unconstitutional\ngovernment action,id.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 12\u201314), the\nmajority here completely sets aside the President\u2019s charged\nstatements about Muslims as irrelevant. That holding erodes the\nfoundational principles of religious tolerance that the Court\nelsewhere has so emphatically protected, and it tells members of\nminority religions in our country \u201c\u00a0\u2018that they are outsiders,\nnot full members of the political commu- nity.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSanta\u00a0Fe, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 309.Today\u2019s holding is all the more troubling given\nthe stark parallels between the reasoning of this case and that ofKorematsuv.United States, 323 U.\u00a0S. 214\n(1944).See Brief for Japanese American Citizens League asAmicus Curiae. InKorematsu, the Court gave \u201ca pass\n[to] an odious, gravely injurious racial classification\u201d authorized\nby an executive order.Adarand Constructors, Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a, 515 U.\u00a0S. 200, 275 (1995) (Ginsburg, J.,\ndissenting). As here, the Government invoked an ill-defined\nnational-security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of\nsweeping proportion. See Brief for Japanese American Citizens\nLeague asAmicus Curiae12\u201314. As here, the exclusion order\nwas rooted in dangerous stereotypes about,inter alia, a\nparticular group\u2019s supposed inability to assimilate and desire to\nharm the United States. SeeKorematsu, 323 U.\u00a0S., at\n236\u2013240 (Murphy, J., dissenting). As here, the Government was\nunwilling to reveal its own intelligence agencies\u2019 views of the\nalleged security concerns to the very citizens it purported to\nprotect.

And as here,\nthere was strong evidence that impermissible hostility and animus\nmoti- vated the Government\u2019s policy.Although a majority of the Court inKorematsuwas willing to uphold the Government\u2019s actions\nbased on a barren invocation of national security, dissenting\nJustices warned of that decision\u2019s harm to our constitutional\nfabric. Justice Murphy recognized that there is a need for great\ndeference to the Executive Branch in the context of national\nsecurity, but cautioned that \u201cit is essential that there be\ndefinite limits to [the government\u2019s] discretion,\u201d as\n\u201c[i]ndividuals must not be left impoverished of their\nconstitutional rights on a plea of military necessity that has\nneither substance nor support.\u201d 323 U.\u00a0S., at 234 (Murphy, J.,\ndissenting). Justice Jackson lamented that the Court\u2019s decision\nupholding the Government\u2019s policy would prove to be \u201ca far more\nsubtle blow to liberty than the promulgation of the order itself,\u201d\nfor although the executive order was not likely to be long lasting,\nthe Court\u2019s willingness to tolerate it would endure.Id.,at\n245\u2013246.In the intervening years sinceKorematsu,\nour Nation has done much to leave its sordid legacy behind. See,e.g.,Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 50 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\nApp. \u00a74211et\u00a0seq.(setting forth remedies to\nindividuals affected by the executive order at issue inKorematsu); Non-Detention Act of 1971, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a74001(a) (forbidding the imprisonment or detention by the United\nStates of any citizen absent an Act of Congress). Today, the Court\ntakes the important step of finally overrulingKorematsu,\ndenouncing it as \u201cgravely wrong the day it was decided.\u201dAnte,at 38 (citingKorematsu, 323 U.\u00a0S., at 248\n(Jackson, J., dissenting)). This formal repudiation of a shameful\nprecedent is laud- able and long overdue. But it does not make the\nmajority\u2019s decision here acceptable or right. By blindly accepting\nthe Government\u2019s misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory\npolicy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the\nname of a superficial claim of national security, the Court\nredeploys the same dangerous logic underlyingKorematsuand\nmerely replaces one \u201cgravely wrong\u201d decision with another.Ante,at 38.Our Constitution demands, and our country\ndeserves, a Judiciary willing to hold the coordinate branches to\naccount when they defy our most sacred legal commitments. Because\nthe Court\u2019s decision today has failed in that respect, with\nprofound regret, I dissent.Notes1According to the White\nHouse, President Trump\u2019s statements on Twitter are \u201cofficial\nstatements.\u201d App. 133.2The content of these\nvideos is highly inflammatory, and their titles are arguably\nmisleading. For instance, the person depicted in the video entitled\n\u201cMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\u201d was reportedly not\na \u201cmigrant,\u201d and his religion is not publicly known.

Brief for\nPetitioners 66\u201367. But nothing in our precedent supports that\nblinkered approach. To the contrary, courts must con-sider \u201cthe\nhistorical background of the decision under challenge, the specific\nseries of events leading to the enactment or official policy in\nquestion, and the legislative or administrative history.\u201dChurch\nof Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.v.Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S.\n520, 540 (1993) (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Moreover, President Trump\nand his advisers have repeatedly acknowledged that the Proclamation\nand its predecessors are an outgrowth of the President\u2019s campaign\nstatements. For example, just last November, the Deputy White House\nPress Secretary reminded the media that the Proclamation addresses\n\u201cissues\u201d the President has been talking about \u201cfor years,\u201d\nincluding on \u201cthe campaign trail.\u201dIRAP II, 883 F.\u00a03d\n233, 267 (CA4 2018). In any case, as the Fourth Circuit correctly\nrecognized, even without relying on any of the President\u2019s campaign\nstatements, a reasonable observer would conclude that the\nProclamation was enacted for the impermissible purpose of\ndisfavoring Muslims.Id., at 266, 268.4At oral argument, the\nSolicitor General asserted that President Trump \u201cmade crystal-clear\non September 25 that he had no intention of imposing the Muslim\nban\u201d and \u201chas praised Islam as one of the great countries\n[sic] of the world.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 81. Because the record\ncontained no evidence of any such statement made on September 25th,\nhowever, the Solicitor General clarified after oral argument that\nhe actually intended to refer to President Trump\u2019s statement during\na television interview on January 25, 2017. Letter from N.\nFrancisco, Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court (May 1,\n2018); Reply Brief 28, n. 8. During that interview, the President\nwas asked whether EO\u20131 was \u201cthe Muslim ban,\u201d and answered, \u201cno it\u2019s\nnot the Muslim ban.\u201d See Transcript: ABC News anchor David Muir\ninterviews President Trump, ABC News, Jan. 25, 2017,\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-president\u00a0/\u00a0story\u00a0?\u00a0id\u00a0=45047602.\nBut that lone assertion hardly qualifies as a disavowal of the\nPresident\u2019s comments about Islam\u2014some of which were spoken after\nJanuary 25, 2017. Moreover, it strains credulity to say that\nPresident Trump\u2019s January 25th statement makes \u201ccrystal-clear\u201d that\nhe never intended to impose a Muslim ban given that, until May\n2017, the President\u2019s website displayed the statement regarding his\ncampaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the\ncountry.5MandelandDinare readily distinguishable from this case for a number\nof reasons. First,MandelandDineach involved a\nconstitutional challenge to an Executive Branch decision to exclude\na single foreign national under a specific statutory ground of\ninadmissibility.Mandel, 408 U.\u00a0S., at 767;Din,\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Here, by contrast,\nPresident Trump is not exercising his discretionary authority to\ndetermine the admission or exclusion of a particular foreign\nnational. He promulgated an executive order affecting millions of\nindividuals on a categorical basis. Second,MandelandDindid not purport to establish the framework for\nadjudicating cases (like this one) involving claims that the\nExecutive Branch violated the Establishment Clause by acting\npursuant to an unconstitutional purpose. ApplyingMandel\u2019s\nnarrow standard of review to such a claim would run contrary to\nthis Court\u2019s repeated admonition that \u201c[f\u00a0]acial neutrality is\nnot determinative\u201d in the Establishment Clause context.Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 534. Likewise, the majority\u2019s\npassing invocation ofFiallov.Bell, 430 U.\u00a0S.\n787 (1977), is misplaced.Fiallo, unlike this case,\naddressed a constitutional challenge to a statute enacted by\nCongress, not an order of the President.Id.,at 791.Fiallo\u2019s application ofMandelsays little about\nwhetherMandel\u2019s narrow standard of review applies to the\nunilateral executive proclamation promulgated under the\ncircumstances of this case. Finally, even assuming thatMandelandDinapply here, they would not preclude us\nfrom looking behind the face of the Proclamation because plaintiffs\nhave made \u201can affirmative showing of bad faith,\u201dDin, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5), by the President who, among\nother things, instructed his subordinates to find a \u201clega[l]\u201d way\nto enact a Muslim ban, App. 125; seesupra,at\n4\u201310.6The majority chides as\n\u201cproblematic\u201d the importation of Establishment Clause jurisprudence\n\u201cin the national security and foreign affairs context.\u201dAnte, at 32\u201333, n.\u00a05. As the majority sees it, this\nCourt\u2019s Establishment Clause precedents do not apply to cases\ninvolving \u201cimmigration policies, diplomatic sanctions, and military\nactions.\u201dAnte,at 32, n.\u00a05. But just because the Court\nhas not confronted the precise situation at hand does not render\nthese cases (or the principles they announced) inapplicable.\nMoreover, the majority\u2019s complaint regarding the lack of direct\nauthority is a puzzling charge, given that the majority itself\nfails to cite any \u201cauthority for its proposition\u201d that a more\nprobing review is inappropriate in a case like this one, where\nUnited States citizens allege that the Executive has violated the\nEstablishment Clause by issuing a sweeping executive order\nmotivated by animus.Ante, at 33 n.\u00a05; seesupra,at 14, and n.\u00a05. In any event, even if there is\nno prior case directly on point, it is clear from our precedent\nthat \u201c[w]hatever power the United States Constitution envisions for\nthe Executive\u201d in the context of national security and foreign\naffairs, \u201cit most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches\nwhen individual liberties are at stake.\u201dHamdiv.Rumsfeld, 542 U.\u00a0S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality\nopinion). This Court\u2019s Establishment Clause precedents require\nthat, if a reasonable observer would understand an executive action\nto be driven by discriminatory animus, the action be invalidated.\nSeeMcCreary, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 860. That\nreasonable-observer inquiry includes consideration of the\nGovernment\u2019s asserted justifications for its actions. The\nGovernment\u2019s invocation of a national-security justification,\nhowever, does not mean that the Court should close its eyes to\nother relevant information. Deference is different from\nunquestioning acceptance. Thus, what is \u201cfar more problematic\u201d in\nthis case is the majority\u2019s apparent willingness to throw the\nEstablishment Clause out the window and forgo any meaningful\nconstitutional review at the mere mention of a national-security\nconcern.Ante,at 32, n.\u00a05.7It is important to note,\nparticularly given the nature of this case, that many consider\n\u201cusing the term \u2018alien\u2019 to refer to other human beings\u201d to be\n\u201coffensive and demeaning.\u201dFloresv.United\u00a0States\nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., 718 F.3d 548, 551\u2013552,\nn.\u00a01 (CA6 2013). I use the term here only where necessary \u201cto\nbe consistent with the statutory language\u201d that Congress has chosen\nand \u201cto avoid any confusion in replacing a legal term of art with a\nmore appropriate term.\u201dIbid.8See Brief for American\nCouncil on Education et al. asAmiciCuriae; Brief\nfor Colleges and Universities asAmici Curiae; Brief for New\nYork University asAmicus Curiae.9See Brief for Retired\nGenerals and Admirals of the U.\u00a0S.

The District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting\nnationwide relief. Given the nature of the Establishment Clause\nviolation and the unique circumstances of this case, the imposition\nof a nationwide injunction was \u201c\u00a0\u2018necessary to provide\ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMadsenv.Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U.\u00a0S. 753, 765 (1994);\nseeCalifanov.Yamasaki, 442 U.\u00a0S. 682, 702\n(1979) (\u201c[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent\nof the violation established, not by the geographical extent of the\nplaintiff class\u201d).",
