BABY GIRL, a\nminor child under the age of fourteen years, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nsouth carolina[June 25, 2013]Justice Sotomayor,\nwith whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, and with whom\nJustice Scalia joins in part, dissenting.A casual reader of the\nCourt\u2019s opinion could be forgiven for thinking this an easy\ncase, one in which the text of the applicable statute clearly\npoints the way to the only sen- sible result. In truth, however,\nthe path from the text of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978\n(ICWA) to the result the Court reaches is anything but clear, and\nits result anything but right.The reader\u2019s\nfirst clue that the majority\u2019s supposedly straightforward\nreasoning is flawed is that not all Members who adopt its\ninterpretation believe it is compelled by the text of the statute,\nsee ante, at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring); nor are they all willing\nto accept the consequences it will necessarily have beyond the\nspecific factual sce- nario confronted here, see ante, at 1\n(Breyer, J., concurring). The second clue is that the majority\nbegins its analysis by plucking out of context a single phrase from\nthe last clause of the last subsection of the relevant provision,\nand then builds its entire argument upon it. That is not how we\nordinarily read statutes. The third clue is that the major- ity\nopenly professes its aversion to Congress\u2019 explicitly stated\npurpose in enacting the statute. The majority ex- presses concern\nthat reading the Act to mean what it says will make it more\ndifficult to place Indian children in adoptive homes, see ante, at\n14, 16, but the Congress that enacted the statute announced its\nintent to stop \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian\nfamilies [from being] broken up\u201d by, among other things, a\ntrend of \u201cplac[ing] [Indian children] in non-Indian\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. adoptive homes.\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71901(4). Policy disagreement with Congress\u2019 judg- ment\nis not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro- visions of\nthe Act. Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt a reading of ICWA that\nis contrary to both its text and its stated purpose. I respectfully\ndissent.IBeginning its reading\nwith the last clause of \u00a71912(f), the majority concludes that\na single phrase appearing there\u2014\u201ccontinued\ncustody\u201d\u2014means that the entirety of the subsection is\ninapplicable to any parent, however committed, who has not\npreviously had physical or legal custody of his child. Working back\nto front, the majority then concludes that \u00a71912(d), tainted\nby its association with \u00a71912(f), is also inapplicable; in the\nmajority\u2019s view, a family bond that does not take custodial\nform is not a family bond worth preserving from\n\u201cbreakup.\u201d Because there are apparently no limits on\nthe contaminating power of this single phrase, the majority does\nnot stop there. Under its reading, \u00a71903(9), which makes\nbiological fathers \u201cparent[s]\u201d under this federal\nstatute (and where, again, the phrase \u201ccontinued\ncustody\u201d does not appear), has substantive force only when a\nbirth father has physical or state-recognized legal custody of his\ndaughter.When it excludes\nnoncustodial biological fathers from the Act\u2019s substantive\nprotections, this textually backward reading misapprehends\nICWA\u2019s structure and scope. Moreover, notwithstanding the\nmajority\u2019s focus on the per- ceived parental shortcomings of\nBirth Father, its rea- soning necessarily extends to all Indian\nparents who have never had custody of their children, no matter how\nfully those parents have embraced the financial and emotional\nresponsibilities of parenting. The majority thereby transforms a\nstatute that was intended to provide uniform federal standards for\nchild custody proceedings involving Indian children and their\nbiological parents into an illogical piecemeal scheme.ABetter to start at\nthe beginning and consider the operation of the statute as a whole.\nCf. ante, at 13 (\u201c[S]tatutory construction \u2018is a\nholistic endeavor[,]\u2019 and .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018[a]\nprovision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified\nby the remainder of the statutory scheme\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quoting United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest\nAssociates, Ltd., 484 U.\u00a0S. 365, 371 (1988) )).ICWA commences with\nexpress findings. Congress rec- ognized that \u201cthere is no\nresource that is more vital to the continued existence and\nintegrity of Indian tribes than their children,\u201d 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71901(3), and it found that this resource\nwas threatened. State authorities insufficiently sensitive to\n\u201cthe essential tribal relations of Indian people and the\ncultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and\nfamilies\u201d were breaking up Indian families and moving Indian\nchildren to non-Indian homes and institutions. See\n\u00a7\u00a71901(4)\u2013(5). As \u00a71901(4) makes clear, and as\nthis Court recognized in Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\nHolyfield, 490 U.\u00a0S. 30, 33 (1989) , adoptive placements of\nIndian children with non-Indian families contributed significantly\nto the overall problem. See \u00a71901(4) (finding that \u201can\nalarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children are placed in\nnon-Indian .\u00a0.\u00a0. adoptive homes\u201d).Consistent with these\nfindings, Congress declared its purpose \u201cto protect the best\ninterests of Indian children and to promote the stability and\nsecurity of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of\nminimum Federal standards\u201d applicable to child custody\nproceedings involving Indian children. \u00a71902. Section 1903\nthen goes on to establish the reach of these protections through\nits defi- nitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these\ndefinitions are crucial to understanding the statute\u2019s full\nscope.First, ICWA defines the\nterm \u201cparent\u201d broadly to mean \u201cany biological\nparent .\u00a0.\u00a0. of an Indian child or any In- dian person\nwho has lawfully adopted an Indian child.\u201d \u00a71903(9). It\nis undisputed that Baby Girl is an \u201cIndian child\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the statute, see \u00a71903(4); ante, at 2,\nn.\u00a01, and Birth Father consequently qualifies as a\n\u201cparent\u201d under the Act. The statutory definition of\nparent \u201cdoes not include the unwed father where paternity has\nnot been acknowledged or established,\u201d \u00a71903(9), but\nBirth Father\u2019s biological paternity has never been questioned\nby any party and was confirmed by a DNA test during the state court\nproceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a (Sealed).Petitioners and Baby\nGirl\u2019s guardian ad litem devote many pages of briefing to\narguing that the term \u201cparent\u201d should be defined with\nreference to the law of the State in which an ICWA child custody\nproceeding takes place. See Brief for Petitioners 19\u201329;\nBrief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 32\u201341. These\narguments, however, are inconsistent with our recognition in\nHolyfield that Congress intended the critical terms of the statute\nto have uniform federal definitions. See 490 U.\u00a0S., at\n44\u201345. It is therefore unsurprising, although far from\nunimportant, that the majority assumes for the purposes of its\nanalysis that Birth Father is an ICWA \u201cparent.\u201d See\nante, at 7.Second, the Act\u2019s\ncomprehensive definition of \u201cchild custody proceeding\u201d\nincludes not only \u201c\u00a0\u2018adoptive\nplacement[s],\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018preadoptive\nplacement[s],\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018foster\ncare placement[s],\u2019\u00a0\u201d but also\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018termination of parental\nrights\u2019\u00a0\u201d proceedings. \u00a71903(1). This last\ncategory encompasses \u201cany action resulting in the termination\nof the parent-child relationship,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(ii)\n(emphasis added). So far, then, it is clear that Birth Father has a\nfederally recognized status as Baby Girl\u2019s\n\u201cparent\u201d and that his \u201cparent-child\nrelationship\u201d with her is subject to the protections of the\nAct.These protections are\nnumerous. Had Birth Father petitioned to remove this proceeding to\ntribal court, for example, the state court would have been\nobligated to transfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or\ngood cause to the contrary. See \u00a71911(b). Any voluntary\nconsent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption would have\nbeen invalid unless written and executed before a judge and would\nhave been revocable up to the time a final decree of adoption was\nentered. [1] See\n\u00a7\u00a71913(a), (c). And \u00a71912, the center of the dispute\nhere, sets forth procedural and substantive standards applicable in\n\u201cinvoluntary proceeding[s] in a State court,\u201d including\nfoster care placements of Indian children and termination of paren-\ntal rights proceedings. \u00a71912(a). I consider\n\u00a71912\u2019s provisions in order.Section 1912(a)\nrequires that any party seeking \u201ctermination of parental\nrights t[o] an Indian child\u201d provide notice to both the\nchild\u2019s \u201cparent or Indian custodian\u201d and the\nchild\u2019s tribe \u201cof the pending proceedings and of their\nright of intervention.\u201d Section 1912(b) mandates that counsel\nbe provided for an indigent \u201cparent or In- dian\ncustodian\u201d in any \u201ctermination proceeding.\u201d\nSection 1912(c) also gives all \u201cpart[ies]\u201d to a\ntermination proceeding\u2014which, thanks to \u00a7\u00a71912(a)\nand (b), will always include a biological father if he desires to\nbe present\u2014the right to inspect all material \u201creports\nor other documents filed with the court.\u201d By providing\nnotice, counsel, and access to relevant documents, the statute\nensures a biological father\u2019s meaningful participation in an\nadoption proceeding where the termination of his parental rights is\nat issue.These protections are\nconsonant with the principle, recognized in our cases, that the\nbiological bond between parent and child is meaningful. \u201c[A]\nnatural parent\u2019s desire for and right to the companionship,\ncare, custody, and management of his or her children,\u201d we\nhave explained, \u201cis an interest far more precious than any\nprop- erty right.\u201d Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.\u00a0S. 745\n\u2013759 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also\ninfra, at 19-20. Although the Constitution does not compel the\nprotection of a biological father\u2019s parent-child relationship\nuntil he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has\nnevertheless recognized that \u201cthe biological connection\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. offers the natural father an opportunity that no\nother male possesses to develop a relationship with his\noffspring.\u201d Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.\u00a0S. 248, 262 (1983)\n. Federal recognition of a parent-child relationship between a\nbirth father and his child is consistent with ICWA\u2019s purpose\nof providing greater protection for the familial bonds between\nIndian parents and their children than state law may afford.The majority does not\nand cannot reasonably dispute that ICWA grants biological fathers,\nas \u201cparent[s],\u201d the right to be present at a\ntermination of parental rights proceeding and to have their views\nand claims heard there. [2]\nBut the majority gives with one hand and takes away with the other.\nHaving assumed a uniform federal definition of \u201cparent\u201d\nthat confers certain procedural rights, the majority then\nillogically concludes that ICWA\u2019s substantive protections are\navailable only to a subset of \u201cparent[s]\u201d: those who\nhave previously had physical or state-recognized legal custody of\nhis or her child. The statute does not support this departure.Section 1912(d)\nprovides that\u201cAny party\nseeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of\nparental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy\nthe court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial\nservices and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\nbreakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved\nunsuccessful.\u201d (Emphasis added.)In other words, subsection (d) requires that an\nattempt be made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic\nmeasures of foster care placement or termination of parental rights\ncan be taken.The majority would hold\nthat the use of the phrase \u201cbreakup of the Indian\nfamily\u201d in this subsection means that it does not apply where\na birth father has not previously had custody of his child. Ante,\nat 12. But there is nothing about this capacious phrase that\nlicenses such a narrowing construction. As the majority notes,\n\u201cbreakup\u201d means \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he\ndiscontinuance of a relationship.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 12\n(quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992)). So far,\nall of \u00a71912\u2019s provisions expressly apply in actions\naimed at terminating the \u201cparent-child relationship\u201d\nthat exists between a birth father and his child, and they extend\nto it meaningful protections. As a logical matter, that\nrelationship is fully capable of being preserved via remedial\nservices and rehabilitation programs. See infra, at 15\u201317.\nNothing in the text of subsection (d) indicates that this blood\nrelationship should be excluded from the category of familial\n\u201crelationships\u201d that the pro- vision aims to save from\n\u201cdiscontinuance.\u201dThe majority, reaching\nthe contrary conclusion, asserts baldly that \u201cwhen an Indian\nparent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has\nnever been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody,\nthere is no \u2018relationship\u2019 that would be\n\u2018discontinu[ed]\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the termination of\nthe Indian parent\u2019s rights.\u201d Ante, at 12. Says who?\nCertainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth Father as\nBaby Girl\u2019s \u201cparent,\u201d and, in conjunction with\nICWA\u2019s other provisions, it further establishes that their\n\u201cparent-child relationship\u201d is protected under federal\nlaw. In the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no\nwarrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress\u2019 by\nsaying that \u201cno \u2018relationship\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nexists between Birth Father and Baby Girl simply because, based on\nthe hotly con- tested facts of this case, it views their family\nbond as in- sufficiently substantial to deserve protection. [3] Ibid.The majority states\nthat its \u201cinterpretation of \u00a71912(d) is .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nconfirmed by the provision\u2019s placement next to \u00a71912(e)\nand \u00a71912(f),\u201d both of which use the phrase\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018continued custody.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at\n13. This is the only aspect of the majority\u2019s argument\nregarding \u00a71912(d) that is based on ICWA\u2019s actual text\nrather than layers of assertion su- perimposed on the text; but the\nconclusion the majority draws from the juxtaposition of these\nprovisions is exactly backward.Section 1912(f) is\npaired with \u00a71912(e), and as the ma- jority notes, both come\non the heels of the requirement of rehabilitative efforts just\nreviewed. The language of the two provisions is nearly identical;\nsubsection (e) is headed \u201cFoster care placement\norders,\u201d and subsection (f), the relevant provision here, is\nheaded \u201cParental rights termination orders.\u201d Subsection\n(f) reads in its entirety,\u201cNo\ntermination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in\nthe absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert\nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or\nphysical damage to the child.\u201d \u00a71912(f). [4]The immediate inference to be drawn from the\nstatute\u2019s structure is that subsections (e) and (f) work in\ntandem with the rehabilitative efforts required by (d). Under\nsubsection (d), state authorities must attempt to provide\n\u201cremedial services and rehabilitative programs\u201d aimed\nat avoiding foster care placement or termination of parental\nrights; (e) and (f), in turn, bar state authorities from ordering\nfoster care or terminating parental rights until these curative\nefforts have failed and it is established that the child will\nsuffer \u201cserious emotional or physical damage\u201d if his or\nher familial situation is not altered. Nothing in subsections (a)\nthrough (d) suggests a limitation on the types of parental\nrelationships that are protected by any of the provisions of\n\u00a71912, and there is nothing in the structure of \u00a71912\nthat would lead a reader to expect subsection (e) or (f) to\nintroduce any such qualification. Indeed, both subsections, in\ntheir opening lines, refer back to the prior provisions of\n\u00a71912 with the phrase \u201cin such proceeding.\u201d This\nlanguage indicates, quite logically, that in actions where\nsubsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f) apply too. [5]All this, and still the\nmost telling textual evidence is yet to come: The text of the\nsubsection begins by announcing, \u201c[n]o termination of\nparental rights may be ordered\u201d unless the specified\nevidentiary showing is made. To repeat, a \u201ctermination of\nparental rights\u201d includes \u201cany action resulting in the\ntermination of the parent-child relationship,\u201d 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added), includ- ing\nthe relationship Birth Father, as an ICWA \u201cparent,\u201d has\nwith Baby Girl. The majority\u2019s reading disregards the\nAct\u2019s sweeping definition of \u201ctermination of parental\nrights,\u201d which is not limited to terminations of custodial\nrelationships.The entire foundation\nof the majority\u2019s argument that subsection (f) does not apply\nis the lonely phrase \u201ccontinued custody.\u201d It simply\ncannot bear the interpretive weight the majority would place on\nit.Because a primary\ndictionary definition of \u201ccontinued\u201d is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018carried on or kept up without\ncessation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 8 (brackets omitted), the\nmajority concludes that \u00a71912(f) \u201cdoes not apply in\ncases where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian\nchild,\u201d ante, at 8. Emphasizing that Birth Father never had\nphysical custody or, under state law, legal custody of Baby Girl,\nthe majority finds the statute inapplicable here. Ante, at\n10\u201311. But \u201cliteralness may strangle meaning.\u201d\nUtah Junk Co. v. Porter, 328 U.\u00a0S. 39, 44 (1946) . See also\nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.\u00a0S. 337 \u2013345 (1997)\n(noting that a term that may \u201c[a]t first blush\u201d seem\nunambiguous can prove otherwise when examined in the context of the\nstatute as a whole). [6] In\nlight of the structure of \u00a71912, which indicates that\nsubsection (f) is applicable to the same actions to which\nsubsections (a) through (d) are applicable; the use of the phrase\n\u201csuch proceeding[s]\u201d at the start of subsection (f) to\nreinforce this structural inference; and finally, the\nprovision\u2019s explicit statement that it applies to\n\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d proceedings, the\nnecessary conclusion is that the word \u201ccustody\u201d does\nnot strictly denote a state-recognized custodial relationship. If\none refers back to the Act\u2019s definitional section, this\nconclusion is not surprising. Section 1903(1) includes \u201cany\naction resulting in the termination of the parent-child\nrelationship\u201d within the meaning of \u201cchild custody\nproceeding,\u201d thereby belying any congressional intent to give\nthe term \u201ccustody\u201d a narrow and exclusive definition\nthroughout the statute.In keeping with\n\u00a71903(1) and the structure and language of \u00a71912 overall,\nthe phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d is most sensibly read to\nrefer generally to the continuation of the parent-child\nrelationship that an ICWA \u201cparent\u201d has with his or her\nchild. A court applying \u00a71912(f) where the parent does not\nhave pre-existing custody should, as Birth Father argues, determine\nwhether the party seeking ter- mination of parental rights has\nestablished that the continuation of the parent-child relationship\nwill result in \u201cserious emotional or physical damage to the\nchild.\u201d [7]The majority is willing\nto assume, for the sake of argument, that Birth Father is a\n\u201cparent\u201d within the meaning of ICWA. But the majority\nfails to account for all that follows from that assumption. The\nmajority repeatedly passes over the term \u201ctermination of\nparental rights\u201d that, as defined by \u00a71903, clearly\nencompasses an action aimed at severing Birth Father\u2019s\n\u201cparent-child relationship\u201d with Baby Girl. The\nmajority chooses instead to focus on phrases not statutorily\ndefined that it then uses to exclude Birth Father from the benefits\nof his parental status. When one must disregard a statute\u2019s\nuse of terms that have been explicitly defined by Congress, that\nshould be a signal that one is distorting, rather than faithfully\nreading, the law in question.BThe majority also\ndoes not acknowledge the full impli- cations of its assumption that\nthere are some ICWA \u201cparent[s]\u201d to whom\n\u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f) do not apply. Its dis- cussion focuses\non Birth Father\u2019s particular actions, but nothing in the\nmajority\u2019s reasoning limits its manufactured class of\nsemiprotected ICWA parents to biological fathers who failed to\nsupport their child\u2019s mother during pregnancy. Its logic\nwould apply equally to noncustodial fathers who have actively\nparticipated in their child\u2019s upbringing.Consider an Indian\nfather who, though he has never had custody of his biological\nchild, visits her and pays all of his child support obligations. [8] Suppose that, due to\ndeficiencies in the care the child received from her custodial\nparent, the State placed the child with a foster family and\nproposed her ultimate adoption by them. Clearly, the father\u2019s\nparental rights would have to be terminated before the adoption\ncould go forward. [9] On the\nmajority\u2019s view, notwithstanding the fact that this father\nwould be a \u201cparent\u201d under ICWA, he would not receive\nthe benefit of either \u00a71912(d) or \u00a71912(f). Presumably\nthe court considering the adoption petition would have to apply\nsome standard to determine whether termination of his parental\nrights was appropriate. But from whence would that standard\ncome?Not from the statute\nCongress drafted, according to the majority. The majority suggests\nthat it might come from state law. See ante, at 13, n.\u00a08. But\nit is incongruous to suppose that Congress intended a patchwork of\nfederal and state law to apply in termination of parental rights\nproceedings. Congress enacted a statute aimed at protecting the\nfamilial relationships between Indian parents and their children\nbecause it concluded that state authorities \u201coften failed to\nrecognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the\ncultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and\nfamilies.\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71901(5). It provided a\n\u201cminimum Federal standar[d],\u201d \u00a71902, for\ntermination of parental rights that is more demanding than the\nshowing of unfitness under a high \u201cclear and convincing\nevidence\u201d standard that is the norm in the States, see 1 J.\nHollinger, Adoption Law and Practice \u00a72.10 (2012); Santosky,\n455 U.\u00a0S., at 767\u2013768.While some States might\nprovide protections compar- able to \u00a71912(d)\u2019s required\nremedial efforts and \u00a71912(f)\u2019s heightened standard for\ntermination of parental rights, many will provide less. There is no\nreason to believe Congress wished to leave protection of the\nparental rights of a subset of ICWA \u201cparent[s]\u201d\ndependent on the happenstance of where a particular \u201cchild\ncustody proceeding\u201d takes place. I would apply, as the\nstatute construed in its totality commands, the standards Congress\nprovided in \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f) to the termination of all\nICWA \u201cparent[s\u2019]\u201d parent-child relationships.IIThe majority\u2019s\ntextually strained and illogical reading of the statute might be\nexplicable, if not justified, if there were reason to believe that\nit avoided anomalous results or furthered a clear congressional\npolicy. But neither of these conditions is present here.AWith respect to\n\u00a71912(d), the majority states that it would be\n\u201cunusual\u201d to apply a rehabilitation requirement where a\nnatural parent has never had custody of his child. Ante, at 14. The\nmajority does not support this bare assertion, and in fact state\nchild welfare authorities can and do provide reunification services\nfor biological fathers who have not previously had custody of their\nchildren. [10] And\nnotwithstanding the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s im-\nprecise interpretation of the provision, see 398 S.\u00a0C., at\n647\u2013648, 731 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 562, \u00a71912(d) does not\nrequire the prospective adoptive family to themselves undertake the\nmandated rehabilitative efforts. Rather, it requires the party\nseeking termination of parental rights to \u201csatisfy the court\nthat active efforts have been made\u201d to provide appropriate\nremedial services.In other words, the\nprospective adoptive couple have to make an evidentiary showing,\nnot undertake person-to-person remedial outreach. The services\nthemselves might be attempted by the Indian child\u2019s Tribe, a\nstate agency, or a private adoption agency. Such remedial efforts\nare a familiar requirement of child welfare law, including fed-\neral child welfare policy. See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7671(a)(15)(B) (requiring States receiving federal funds for\nfoster care and adoption assistance to make \u201creasonable\nefforts .\u00a0.\u00a0. to preserve and reunify families\u201d\nprior to foster care placement or removal of a child from its\nhome).There is nothing\n\u201cbizarre,\u201d ante, at 14, about placing on the party\nseeking to terminate a father\u2019s parental rights the burden of\nshowing that the step is necessary as well as justified. \u201cFor\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. natural parents, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the consequence of\nan erroneous termination [of parental rights] is the unnecessary\ndestruction of their natural family.\u201d Santosky, 455\nU.\u00a0S., at 766. In any event, the question is a nonissue in\nthis case given the family court\u2019s finding that Birth Father\nis \u201ca fit and proper person to have custody of his\nchild\u201d who \u201chas demonstrated [his] ability to parent\neffectively\u201d and who possesses \u201cunwavering love for\nthis child.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a (Sealed).\nPetitioners cannot show that rehabilitative efforts have\n\u201cproved unsuccessful,\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71912(d), because Birth Father is not in need of\nrehabilitation. [11]BOn a more general\nlevel, the majority intimates that ICWA grants Birth Father an\nundeserved windfall: in the majority\u2019s words, an \u201cICWA\ntrump card\u201d he can \u201cplay .\u00a0.\u00a0. at the\neleventh hour to override the mother\u2019s decision and the\nchild\u2019s best interests.\u201d Ante, at 16. The implicit\nargument is that Congress could not possibly have intended to\nrecognize a parent-child relationship between Birth Father and Baby\nGirl that would have to be legally terminated (either by valid\nconsent or involuntary termination) before the adoption could\nproceed.But this supposed\nanomaly is illusory. In fact, the law of at least 15 States did\nprecisely that at the time ICWA was passed. [12] And the law of a number of States still\ndoes so. The State of Arizona, for example, requires that notice of\nan adoption petition be given to all \u201cpotential\nfather[s]\u201d and that they be informed of their \u201cright to\nseek custody.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a78\u2013106(G)\u2013(J) (West Supp. 2012). In\nWashington, an \u201calleged father[\u2019s]\u201d consent to\nadoption is required absent the termination of his parental rights,\nWash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a726.33.020(1), 26.33.160(1)(b) (2012);\nand those rights may be terminated only \u201cupon a showing by\nclear, cogent, and convincing evidence\u201d not only that\ntermination is in the best interest of the child and that the\nfather is withholding his consent to adoption contrary to\nchild\u2019s best interests, but also that the father \u201chas\nfailed to perform parental duties under circumstances showing a\nsubstantial lack of regard for his parental obligations,\u201d\n\u00a726.33.120(2). [13]Without doubt, laws\nprotecting biological fathers\u2019 parental rights can\nlead\u2014even outside the context of ICWA\u2014to outcomes that\nare painful and distressing for both would-be adoptive families,\nwho lose a much wanted child, and children who must make a\ndifficult transition. See, e.g., In\u00a0re Adoption of Tobias D.,\n2012 Me. 45, \u00b627, 40 A. 3d 990, 999 (recognizing that award of\ncustody of 2\u00bd-year-old child to biological father under\napplicable state law once paternity is established will result in\nthe \u201cdifficult and pain- ful\u201d necessity of\n\u201cremoving the child from the only home he has ever\nknown\u201d). On the other hand, these rules recognize that\nbiological fathers have a valid interest in a relationship with\ntheir child. See supra, at 6. And children have a reciprocal\ninterest in knowing their biological parents. See Santosky, 455\nU.\u00a0S., at 760\u2013761, n.\u00a011 (describing the\nforeclosure of a newborn child\u2019s opportunity to \u201cever\nknow his natural parents\u201d as a \u201clos[s] [that] cannot be\nmeasured\u201d). These rules also reflect the understanding that\nthe biological bond between a parent and a child is a strong\nfoundation on which a stable and caring relationship may be built.\nMany jurisdictions apply a custodial preference for a fit natural\nparent over a party lacking this biological link. See, e.g.,\nEx\u00a0parte Terry, 494 So.\u00a02d 628, 632 (Ala. 1986); Appeal\nof H.\u00a0R., 581 A.\u00a02d 1141, 1177 (D.\u00a0C. 1990) (opinion\nof Ferren, J.); Stuhr v. Stuhr, 240 Neb. 239, 245, 481 N.\u00a0W.\n2d 212, 216 (1992); In\u00a0re Michael B., 80 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 299,\n309, 604 N.\u00a0E. 2d 122, 127 (1992). Cf. Smith v. Organization\nof Foster Families For Equality & Reform, 431 U.\u00a0S. 816,\n845 (1977) (distinguishing a natural parent\u2019s \u201cliberty\ninterest in family privacy,\u201d which has its source \u201cin\nintrinsic human rights,\u201d with a foster parent\u2019s\nparallel interest in his or her relationship with a child, which\nhas its \u201corigins in an arrangement in which the State has\nbeen a partner from the outset\u201d). This preference is founded\nin the \u201cpresumption that fit parents act in the best\ninterests of their children.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530\nU.\u00a0S. 57, 68 (2000) (plurality opinion).\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[H]istorically [the law] has recognized that\nnatural bonds of affection [will] lead parents\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nto promote their child\u2019s well-being. Ibid. (quoting Parham v.\nJ.\u00a0R., 442 U.\u00a0S. 584, 602 (1979) ).Balancing the\nlegitimate interests of unwed biological fathers against the need\nfor stability in a child\u2019s family situation is difficult, to\nbe sure, and States have, over the years, taken different\napproaches to the problem. Some States, like South Carolina, have\nopted to hew to the con- stitutional baseline established by this\nCourt\u2019s prece- dents and do not require a biological\nfather\u2019s consent to adoption unless he has provided financial\nsupport during pregnancy. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.\u00a0S.\n246 \u2013256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 261. Other States,\nhow- ever, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers\nmore robust protection and to afford them consent rights on the\nbasis of their biological link to the child. At the time that ICWA\nwas passed, as noted, over one-fourth of States did so. See supra,\nat 17\u201318.ICWA, on a\nstraightforward reading of the statute, is consistent with the law\nof those States that protected, and protect, birth fathers\u2019\nrights more vigorously. This reading can hardly be said to generate\nan anomaly. ICWA, as all acknowledge, was \u201cthe product of\nrising concern .\u00a0.\u00a0. [about] abusive child welfare\npractices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of\nIndian children from their families.\u201d Holyfield, 490\nU.\u00a0S., at 32. It stands to reason that the Act would not\nrender the legal status of an Indian father\u2019s relationship\nwith his biological child fragile, but would instead grant it a\ndegree of protection commensurate with the more robust state-law\nstandards. [14]CThe majority also\nprotests that a contrary result to the one it reaches would\ninterfere with the adoption of Indian children. Ante, at 14, 16.\nThis claim is the most perplexing of all. A central purpose of ICWA\nis to \u201cpromote the stability and security of Indian\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. families,\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71902,\nin part by countering the trend of placing \u201can alarmingly\nhigh percentage of [Indian] children .\u00a0.\u00a0. in non-Indian\nfoster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d \u00a71901(4).\nThe Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protecting the familial\nbonds of Indian parents and children, see supra, at 4\u201312;\nand, second, establishing placement preferences should an adoption\ntake place, see \u00a71915(a). ICWA does not interfere with the\nadoption of Indian children except to the extent that it attempts\nto avert the necessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of\nIndian children by non-Indian families less likely.The majority may\nconsider this scheme unwise. But no principle of construction\nlicenses a court to interpret a statute with a view to averting the\nvery consequences Congress expressly stated it was trying to bring\nabout. Instead, it is the \u201c\u00a0\u2018judicial duty to give\nfaithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of\nthe evi- dent legislative purpose in enacting the law in\nquestion.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Graham County Soil and Water\nConservation Dist. v. United States ex\u00a0rel. Wilson, 559\nU.\u00a0S. 280, 298 (2010) (quoting United States v. Bornstein, 423\nU.\u00a0S. 303, 310 (1976) ).The majority further\nclaims that its reading is consistent with the\n\u201cprimary\u201d purpose of the Act, which in the\nmajority\u2019s view was to prevent the dissolution of\n\u201cintact\u201d Indian families. Ante, at 9\u201310. We may\nnot, however, give effect only to congressional goals we designate\n\u201cprimary\u201d while casting aside others classed as\n\u201csecondary\u201d; we must apply the entire statute Congress\nhas written. While there are indications that central among\nCongress\u2019 concerns in enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian\nchildren from homes in which Indian parents or other guardians had\ncustody of them, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71901(4), 1902, Con- gress\nalso recognized that \u201cthere is no resource that is more vital\nto the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than\ntheir children,\u201d \u00a71901(3). As we observed in Holyfield,\nICWA protects not only Indian parents\u2019 interests but also\nthose of Indian tribes. See 490 U.\u00a0S., at 34, 52. A\ntribe\u2019s interest in its next generation of citizens is\nadversely affected by the placement of Indian children in homes\nwith no connection to the tribe, whether or not those children were\ninitially in the custody of an Indian parent. [15]Moreover, the\nmajority\u2019s focus on \u201cintact\u201d families, ante, at\n10, begs the question of what Congress set out to accomplish with\nICWA. In an ideal world, perhaps all parents would be perfect. They\nwould live up to their parental responsibilities by providing the\nfullest possible financial and emotional support to their children.\nThey would never suffer mental health problems, lose their jobs,\nstruggle with substance dependency, or encounter any of the other\nmultitudinous personal crises that can make it difficult to meet\nthese responsibilities. In an ideal world parents would never\nbecome estranged and leave their children caught in the middle. But\nwe do not live in such a world. Even happy families do not always\nfit the custodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve\nIWCA\u2019s substantive protections; unhappy families all too\noften do not. They are families nonetheless. Congress understood as\nmuch. ICWA\u2019s definitions of \u201cparent\u201d and\n\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d provided in \u00a71903\nsweep broadly. They should be honored.DThe majority does not\nrely on the theory pressed by petitioners and the guardian ad litem\nthat the canon of constitutional avoidance compels the conclusion\nthat ICWA is inapplicable here. See Brief for Petitioners\n43\u201351; Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 48\u201358. It\nstates instead that it finds the statute clear. [16] Ante, at 17. But the majority\nnevertheless offers the suggestion that a contrary result would\ncreate an equal protection problem. Ibid. Cf. Brief for Petitioners\n44\u201347; Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem\n53\u201355.It is difficult to make\nsense of this suggestion in light of our precedents, which squarely\nhold that classifications based on Indian tribal membership are not\nimpermissible racial classifications. See United States v.\nAntelope, 430 U.\u00a0S. 641 \u2013647 (1977); Morton v. Mancari,\n417 U.\u00a0S. 535 \u2013554 (1974). The majority\u2019s\nrepeated, analytically unnecessary references to the fact that Baby\nGirl is 3/256 Cherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its\nintimation that the statute may violate the Equal Protection Clause\nas applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante, at 16 (stating\nthat ICWA \u201cwould put certain vulner- able children at a great\ndisadvantage solely because an ancestor\u2014even a remote\none\u2014was an Indian\u201d (emphasis added)). I see no ground\nfor this Court to second-guess the membership requirements of\nfederally recognized Indian tribes, which are independent political\nentities. See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.\u00a0S. 49,\n72, n. 32 (1978) . I am particularly averse to doing so when the\nFederal Government requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for\nofficial recognition, to make \u201cdescen[t] from a historical\nIndian tribe\u201d a condition of membership. 25 CFR \u00a783.7(e)\n(2012).The majority\u2019s\ntreatment of this issue, in the end, does no more than create a\nlingering mood of disapprobation of the criteria for membership\nadopted by the Cherokee Nation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an\n\u201cIndian child\u201d under the statute. Its hints at lurking\nconstitutional problems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its\nstatutory analysis, and accordingly need not detain us any\nlonger.IIIBecause I would\naffirm the South Carolina Supreme Court on the ground that\n\u00a71912 bars the termination of Birth Father\u2019s parental\nrights, I would not reach the question of the applicability of the\nadoptive placement preferences of \u00a71915. I note, however, that\nthe majority does not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on\nremand, Baby Girl\u2019s paternal grandparents or other members of\nthe Cherokee Nation may formally petition for adoption of Baby\nGirl. If these parties do so, and if on remand Birth Father\u2019s\nparental rights are terminated so that an adoption becomes\npossible, they will then be entitled to consideration under the\norder of preference established in \u00a71915. The majority cannot\nrule prospectively that \u00a71915 would not apply to an adoption\npetition that has not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies\n\u201c[i]n any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State\nlaw,\u201d 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71915(a) (emphasis added),\nand contains no temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd\nresult for this Court, in the name of the child\u2019s best in-\nterests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro-\nceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her paternal\ngrandparents, who may have well-established relationships with\nher.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The majority opinion\nturns \u00a71912 upside down, reading it from bottom to top in\norder to reach a conclusion that is manifestly contrary to\nCongress\u2019 express purpose in enacting ICWA: preserving the\nfamilial bonds between Indian parents and their children and, more\nbroadly, Indian tribes\u2019 relationships with the future\ncitizens who are \u201cvital to [their] continued existence and\nintegrity.\u201d \u00a71901(3).The majority casts\nBirth Father as responsible for the painful circumstances in this\ncase, suggesting that he intervened \u201cat the eleventh hour to\noverride the mother\u2019s decision and the child\u2019s best\ninterests,\u201d ante, at 16. I have no wish to minimize the\ntrauma of removing a 27-month-old child from her adoptive family.\nIt bears remembering, however, that Birth Father took action to\nassert his parental rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as\nsoon as he learned of the impending adoption. As the South Carolina\nSupreme Court recognized, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[h]ad the mandate of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. ICWA been followed [in 2010], .\u00a0.\u00a0. much\npotential anguish might have been avoided[;] and in any case the\nlaw cannot be applied so as automatically to \u201creward those\nwho obtain custody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it\nduring any ensuing (and protracted)\nlitigation.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 398 S.\u00a0C., at\n652, 731 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 53\u201354).The majority\u2019s\nhollow literalism distorts the statute and ignores Congress\u2019\npurpose in order to rectify a perceived wrong that, while\nheartbreaking at the time, was a correct application of federal law\nand that in any case cannot be undone. Baby Girl has now resided\nwith her father for 18 months. However difficult it must have been\nfor her to leave Adoptive Couple\u2019s home when she was just\nover 2 years old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age\nof 3\u00bd, she is again removed from her home and sent to live\nhalfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreordained, of\ncourse. But it can be said with certainty that the anguish this\ncase has caused will only be compounded by today\u2019s\ndecision.I believe that the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s judgment was correct, and I\nwould affirm it. I respectfully dissent.Notes1For this reason, the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth Father did not give\nvalid consent to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption when, four months after\nher birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted service and\nwas not contesting the adoption. See 398 S.\u00a0C. 625,\n645\u2013646, 731 S.\u00a0E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at\n5. Petitioners do not challenge this aspect of the South Carolina\ncourt\u2019s holding.2Petitioners concede that,\nassuming Birth Father is a \u201cparent\u201d under ICWA, the\nnotice and counsel provisions of 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71912(a) and (b) apply to him. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n13.3The majority\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u00a71912(d) repeatedly references Birth\nFather\u2019s purported \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d of Baby Girl,\nante, at 12, 13, n.\u00a08, 14, and it contends that its holding\nwith regard to this provision is limited to such circumstances, see\nante, at 13, n.\u00a08; see also ante, at 1 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the\nmajority\u2019s holding given that it is contrary to the language\nand purpose of the statute, the majority never explains either the\ntextual basis or the precise scope of its\n\u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation. I expect that the\nmajority\u2019s inexact use of the term\n\u201cabandon[ment]\u201d will sow confusion, because it is a\ncommonly used term of art in state family law that does not have a\nuniform meaning from State to State. See generally 1 J. Hollinger,\nAdoption Law and Practice \u00a74.04[1][a][ii] (2012) (discussing\nvarious state-law standards for establishing parental abandonment\nofa child).4The full text of\nsubsection (e) is as follows: \u201cNo foster care placement may\nbe ordered in such proceeding inthe absence of a determination,\nsupported by clear and convincing evi-dence, including testimony of\nqualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child\nby the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d\n\u00a71912(e).5For these reasons, I\nreject the argument advanced by the United States that subsection\n(d) applies in the circumstances of this case but subsection (f)\ndoes not. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24\u201326.\nThe United States\u2019 position is contrary to the interrelated\nnature of \u00a7\u00a71912(d), (e), and (f). Under the reading that\nthe United States proposes, in a case such as this one the curative\nprovision would stand alone; ICWA would provide no evidentiary or\nsubstantive standards by which to measure whether foster care\nplacement or termination of parental rights could be ordered in the\nevent that rehabilitative efforts did not succeed. Such a scheme\nwould be oddly incomplete.6The majority\u2019s\ninterpretation is unpersuasive even if one focuses exclusively on\nthe phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d because, as Justice\nScalia explains, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), nothing about the\nadjective \u201ccontinued\u201d mandates the retrospective,\nrather than prospective, application of \u00a71912(f)\u2019s\nstandard.7The majority overlooks\nBirth Father\u2019s principal arguments when it dismisses his\nreading of \u00a71912(f) as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Ante, at 8.\nHe does argue that if one accepts petitioners\u2019 view that it\nis impossible to make a determination of likely harm when a parent\nlacks custody, then the consequence would be that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[n]o termination of parental rights may be\nordered.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Respondent Birth Father 39\n(quoting \u00a71912(f)). But Birth Father\u2019s primary arguments\nassume that it is indeed possible to make a determination of likely\nharm in the circumstances of this case, and that parental rights\ncan be terminated if \u00a71912(f) is met. See id., at\n40\u201342.8The majority attempts to\nminimize the consequences of its holding by asserting that the\nparent-child relationships of noncustodial fathers with visitation\nrights will be at stake in an ICWA proceeding in only\u201ca\nrelatively small class of cases.\u201d Ante, at 13, n.\u00a08. But\nit offers no support for this assertion, beyond speculating that\nthere will not be many fathers affected by its interpretation of\n\u00a71912(d) because it is qualified by an\n\u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation. Ibid. Tellingly, the\nmajor-ity has nothing to say about \u00a71912(f), despite the fact\nthat its interpretation of that provision is not limited in a\nsimilar way. In any event, this example by no means exhausts the\nclass of semiprotected ICWA parents that the majority\u2019s\nopinion creates. It also includes, for example, biological fathers\nwho have not yet established a relationship with their child\nbecause the child\u2019s mother never informed them of the\npregnancy, see, e.g., In\u00a0re Termination of Parental Rights of\nBiological Parents of Baby Boy W., 1999 OK 74, 988 P.\u00a02d 1270,\ntold them falsely that the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or\ntermination, see, e.g., A Child\u2019s Hope, LLC v. Doe, 178\nN.\u00a0C. App. 96, 630 S.\u00a0E. 2d 673 (2006), or otherwise\nobstructed the father\u2019s involvement in the child\u2019s\nlife, see, e.g., In\u00a0re Baby Girl W., 728 S. W. 2d 545 (Mo.\nApp. 1987) (birth mother moved and did not inform father of her\nwhereabouts); In\u00a0re Petition of Doe, 159 Ill. 2d 347, 638\nN.\u00a0E. 2d 181 (1994) (father paid pregnancy expenses until\nbirth mother cut off contact with him and told him that their child\nhad died shortly after birth). And it includes biological fathers\nwho did not contribute to pregnancy expenses because they were\nunable to do so, whether because the father lacked sufficient\nmeans, the expenses were covered by a third party, or the birth\nmother did not pass on the relevant bills. See, e.g., In\u00a0re\nAdoption of B. V., 2001 UT App 290, \u00b6\u00b6 24\u201331, 33\nP.\u00a03d 1083, 1087\u20131088. The majority expresses the\nconcern that my reading of the statute would produce\n\u201cfar-reaching consequences,\u201d because \u201ceven a\nsperm donor\u201d would be entitled to ICWA\u2019s protections.\nAnte, at 13\u201314, n. 8. If there are any examples of women who\ngo to the trouble and expense of artificial insemination and then\ncarry the child to term, only to put the child up for adoption or\nbe found so unfit as mothers that state authorities attempt an\ninvoluntary adoptive placement\u2014thereby necessitating\ntermination of the parental rights of the sperm donor\nfather\u2014the ma-jority does not cite them. As between a\npossibly overinclusive in-terpretation of the statute that covers\nthis unlikely class of cases, and the majority\u2019s\nunderinclusive interpretation that has the very real consequence of\ndenying ICWA\u2019s protections to all noncustodial biological\nfathers, it is surely the majority\u2019s reading that is contrary\nto ICWA\u2019s design.9With a few exceptions not\nrelevant here, before a final decree of adoption may be entered,\none of two things must happen: \u201cthe biological parents must\neither voluntarily relinquish their parental rights or have their\nrights involuntarily terminated.\u201d 2A.

Birth Father does not claim that he is\nentitled to custodyof Baby Girl unless petitioners can satisfy the\ndemanding standard of \u00a71912(f). See Brief for Respondent Birth\nFather 40, n.\u00a015. The question of custody would be analyzed\nindependently, as it was by the South Carolina Supreme Court. Of\ncourse, it will often be the case that cus-tody is subsequently\ngranted to a child\u2019s fit parent, consistent withthe\npresumption that a natural parent will act in the best interests of\nhis child. See supra, at 19\u201320.15Birth\nFather is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation, a fact of\nwhich Birth Mother was aware at the time of her pregnancy and of\nwhich she informed her attorney. See 398 S.\u00a0C. 625,\n632\u2013633, 731 S.\u00a0E. 2d 550, 554 (2012).16Justice Thomas concurs in the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation because, although he finds the\nstatute susceptible of more than one plausible reading, he believes\nthat the majority\u2019s reading avoids \u201csignificant\nconstitutional problems\u201d concerning whether ICWA exceeds\nCongress\u2019 authority under the Indian Commerce Clause. Ante,\nat 1, 3\u201312. No party advanced this argument, and it is\ninconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents holding that\nCongress has \u201cbroad general powers to leg-islate in respect\nto Indian tribes, powers that we have consistently described as\nplenary and exclusive,\u201d founded not only on the Indian\nCommerce Clause but also the Treaty Clause.
