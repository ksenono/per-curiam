S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-6822JASON PEPPER, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit[March 2, 2011]Justice Sotomayor delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This Court has long recognized\nthat sentencing judges \u201cexercise a wide discretion\u201d in the types of\nevidence they may consider when imposing sentence and that\n\u201c[h]ighly relevant\u2014if not essential\u2014to [the] selection of an\nappropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201dWilliamsv.New York,337 U. S. 241, 246\u2013247\n(1949). Congress codified this principle at 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73661,\nwhich provides that \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the\ninformation\u201d a sentencing court may consider \u201cconcerning the\n[defendant\u2019s] background, character, and con-duct,\u201d and at\n\u00a73553(a), which sets forth certain factors that sentencing courts\nmust consider, including \u201cthe history and characteristics of the\ndefendant,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(1). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit concluded in this case that the District Court, when\nresentencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set\naside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner\u2019s\nrehabilitation since his initial sentencing. That conclusion\nconflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentenc-ing law\nand Congress\u2019 express directives in \u00a7\u00a73661 and 3553(a). Although a\nseparate statutory provision, \u00a73742(g)(2), prohibits a district\ncourt at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at\nthe prior sentencing\u2014thus effectively precluding the court from\nconsidering postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing\na non-Guidelines sentence\u2014that provision did not survive our\nholding inUnited Statesv.Booker,543 U. S. 220(2005),\nand we expressly invalidate it today.We hold that when a defendant\u2019s sentence has\nbeen set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may\nconsider evidence of the defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation\nand that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a\ndownward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines range. Separately, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019\nruling that the law of the case doctrine did not require the\nDistrict Court in this case to apply the same percentage departure\nfrom the Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been\napplied at petitioner\u2019s prior sentencing.IIn October 2003, petitioner Jason\nPepper was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute 500\ngrams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7846. After pleading guilty, Pepper appeared for sentencing before\nthen-Chief Judge Mark W. Bennett of the U. S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of Iowa. Pepper\u2019s sentencing range under the\nGuidelines was 97 to 121 months.[Footnote 1] The Government moved for a downward departure\npursuant to USSG \u00a75K1.1 based on Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance\nand recommended a 15 percent downward departure.[Footnote 2] The District Court, however,\nsentenced Pepper to a 24-month prison term, resulting in an\napproximately 75 percent downward departure from the low end of the\nGuidelines range, to be followed by five years of supervised\nrelease. The Government appealed Pepper\u2019s sentence, and in June\n2005, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and\nremanded for resentencing in light of our intervening decision inBooker(and for another reason not relevant here). SeeUnited Statesv.Pepper, 412 F.\u00a03d 995, 999\n(2005)(Pepper I). Pepper completed his 24-month sentence\nthree days afterPepper Iwas issued and began serving his\nterm of supervised release.In May 2006, the District Court\nconducted a resentencing hearing and heard from three witnesses. In\nhis testimony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously\nbeen a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour drug\ntreatment program while in prison and he no longer used any drugs.\nApp. 104\u2013105. Pepper then explained that since his release from\nprison, he had enrolled at a local community college as a full-time\nstudent and had earned A\u2019s in all of his classes in the prior\nsemester.Id., at 106\u2013107. Pepper also testified that he\nhad obtained employment within a few weeks after being released\nfrom custody and was continuing to work part-time while attending\nschool.Id., at 106\u2013110. Pepper confirmed that he was in\ncompliance with all the conditions of his supervised release and\ndescribed his changed attitude since his arrest. Seeid.,\nat 111 (\u201c[M]y life was basically headed to either where\u2014I guess\nwhere I ended up, in prison, or death. Now I have some optimism\nabout my life, about what I can do with my life. I\u2019m glad that I\ngot this chance to try again I guess you could say at a decent\nlife\u2026\u00a0. My life was going nowhere before, and I think it\u2019s\ngoing somewhere now\u201d).Pepper\u2019s father testified that he had\nvirtually no contact with Pepper during the 5-year period leading\nup to his arrest.Id., at 117. Pepper\u2019s drug treatment\nprogram, according to his father, \u201ctruly sobered him up\u201d and \u201cmade\nhis way of thinking change.\u201dId., at 121. He explained\nthat Pepper was now \u201cmuch more mature\u201d and \u201cserious in terms of\nplanning for the future,\u201did., at 119, and that as a\nconsequence, he had re-established a relationship with his son,id., at 118\u2013119.Finally, Pepper\u2019s probation officer testified\nthat, in his view, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light\nof Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation,\nand demonstrated low risk of recidivism.Id., at 126\u2013131.\nThe probation officer also prepared a sentencing memorandum that\nfurther set forth the reasons supporting his recommendation for a\n24-month sentence.The District Court adopted as its findings of\nfact the testimony of the three witnesses and the probation\nofficer\u2019s sentencing memorandum. The court granted a 40 percent\ndownward departure based on Pepper\u2019s substantial assistance,\nreducing the bottom of the Guidelines range from 97 to 58 months.\nThe court then granted a further 59 percent downward variance based\non,inter alia, Pepper\u2019s rehabilitation since his initial\nsentencing.Id., at 143\u2013148.[Footnote 3] The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of\nimprisonment, concluding that \u201cit would [not] advance any purpose\nof federal sentencing policy or any other policy behind the federal\nsentencing guidelines to send this defendant back to prison.\u201dId., at 149\u2013150.The Government again appealed Pepper\u2019s\nsentence, and the Court of Appeals again reversed and remanded for\nresentencing. SeeUnited Statesv.Pepper, 486\nF.\u00a03d 408, 410, 413 (CA8 2007)(Pepper II). The court\nconcluded that, while it was \u201ca close call, [it could not] say the\ndistrict court abused its discretion\u201d by granting the 40 percent\ndownward departure for substantial assistance.Id., at\n411. The court found the further 59 percent downward variance,\nhowever, to be an abuse of discretion.Id., at 412\u2013413. In\ndoing so, the court held that Pepper\u2019s \u201cpost-sentencing\nrehabilitation was an impermissible factor to consider in granting\na downward variance.\u201dId., at 413. The court stated that\nevidence of postsentencing reha-bilitation \u201c\u00a0\u2018is not relevant\nand will not be permitted at resentencing because the district\ncourt could not have considered that evidence at the time of the\noriginal sentencing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and permitting courts to consider\npost-sentencing rehabilitation at resentencing \u201cwould create\nunwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant inequities\ninto the sentencing process.\u201dIbid.[Footnote 4] The Court of Appeals directed that\nthe case be assigned to a different district judge for\nresentencing.Ibid.After the Court of Appeals\u2019 mandate issued,\nPepper\u2019s case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R.\nReade. In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order on the scope\nof the remand fromPepper II, stating that \u201c[t]he court\nwill not consider itself bound to reduce [Pepper\u2019s] advisory\nSentencing Guidelines range by 40% pursuant to USSG \u00a75K1.1.\u201dUnited Statesv.Pepper, No. 03\u2013CR\u20134113\u2013LRR, 2007\nWL 2076041, *4 (ND Iowa 2007). In the meantime, Pepper petitioned\nthis Court for a writ of certiorari, and in January 2008, we\ngranted the petition, vacated the judgment inPepper II,\nand remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further\nconsideration in light ofGallv.United States,552 U. S. 38(2007). SeePepperv.United States,552 U. S. 1089(2008).On remand, the Court of Appeals held thatGalldid not alter its prior conclusion that\n\u201cpost-sentence rehabilitation is an impermissible factor to\nconsider in granting a downward variance.\u201d 518 F.\u00a03d 949, 953\n(CA8 2008)(Pepper III). The court again reversed the\nsentence and remanded for resentencing.In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened\nPepper\u2019s second resentencing hearing. Pepper informed the court\nthat he was still attending school and was now working as a\nsupervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer, where he was\nrecently selected by management as \u201cassociate of the year\u201d and was\nlikely to be promoted the following January. App. 320, 323. Pepper\nalso stated that he had recently married and was now supporting his\nwife and her daughter.Id., at 321. Pepper\u2019s father\nreiterated that Pepper was moving forward in both his career and\nhis family life and that he remained in close touch with his son.\nSeeid., at 300\u2013304.In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a\nsentencing memorandum. Noting that the remand language ofPepper IIIwas nearly identical to the language inPepper II, the court again observed that it was \u201cnot bound\nto reduce [Pepper\u2019s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40%\u201d\nfor substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper was entitled\nonly to a 20 percent downward departure because the assistance was\n\u201ctimely, helpful and important\u201d but \u201cin no way extraordinary.\u201d\nSealed Sentencing Memorandum in No. 03\u2013CR\u20134113\u2013LRR (ND Iowa), Doc.\n198, pp. 7, 10. The court also rejected Pepper\u2019s request for a\ndownward variance based on,inter alia, his postsentencing\nrehabilitation.Id., at 16.The District Court reconvened Pepper\u2019s\nresentencing hearing in January 2009. The court\u2019s decision to grant\na 20 percent downward departure for substantial assistance resulted\nin an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97 months. The court also\ngranted the Government\u2019s motion under Rule 35(b) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure to account for investigative assistance\nPepper provided after he was initially sentenced. The court imposed\na 65-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by 12 months of\nsupervised release.[Footnote\n5]The Court of Appeals affirmed Pepper\u2019s\n65-month sentence. 570 F.\u00a03d 958 (CA8 2009)(Pepper\nIV). As relevant here, the Court of Appeals rejected Pepper\u2019s\nargument that the District Court erred in refusing to consider his\npostsentencing rehabilitation. The court acknowledged that \u201cPepper\nmade significant progress during and following his initial period\nof imprisonment\u201d and \u201ccommend[ed] Pepper on the positive changes he\nhas made in his life,\u201d but concluded that Pepper\u2019s argument was\nforeclosed by Circuit precedent holding that \u201cpost-sentencing\nrehabilitation is not a permissible factor to consider in granting\na downward variance.\u201dId., at 964\u2013965 (citingUnited\nStatesv.Jenners, 473 F.\u00a03d 894, 899 (CA8\n2007);United Statesv.McMannus, 496 F.\u00a03d\n846, 852, n.\u00a04 (CA8 2007)).The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper\u2019s\nclaim that the scope of the remand and the law of the case fromPepper IIandPepper IIIrequired the District\nCourt to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 40\npercent pursuant to USSG \u00a75K1.1. The court noted that its remand\norders inPepper IIandPepper IIIwere \u201cgeneral\nremand[s] for resentencing,\u201d which \u201cdid not place any limitations\non the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in\nresentencing.\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 963. The court further noted\nthat, although issues decided by an appellate court become law of\nthe case on remand to the sentencing court, its earlier decisions\nmerely held that a 40 percent downward departure for substantial\nassistance was not an abuse of discretion, not that the district\ncourt would be bound by the 40 percent departure previously\ngranted.Id., at 963\u2013964.We granted Pepper\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), to decide two questions: (1)\nwhether a district court, after a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set\naside on appeal, may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s\npostsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward variance when\nresentencing the defendant, a question that has divided the Courts\nof Appeals;[Footnote 6] and (2)\nwhether the resentencing court was required, under the law of the\ncase doctrine, to apply the same percentage departure from the\nGuidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied\nat Pepper\u2019s prior sentencing. Because the United States has\nconfessed error in the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on the first\nquestion, we appointed anamicus curiaeto defend the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment.[Footnote 7] We now vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s ruling on\nthe first question and affirm its ruling on the second.IIA\u201cIt has been uniform and constant\nin the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to\nconsider every convicted person as an individual and every case as\na unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate,\nsometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201dKoonv.United States,518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996).\nUnderlying this tradition is the principle that \u201cthe punishment\nshould fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u201dWilliams, 337 U. S., at 247; see alsoPennsylvania ex\nrel. Sullivanv.Ashe,302 U. S. 51, 55 (1937)\n(\u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires\nconsideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime\nwas committed and that there be taken into account the\ncircumstances of the offense together with the character and\npropensities of the offender\u201d).Consistent with this principle,\nwe have observed that \u201cboth before and since the American colonies\nbecame a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a\npolicy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide\ndiscretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him\nin determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed\nwithin limits fixed by law.\u201dWilliams, 337 U. S., at 246.\nIn particular, we have emphasized that \u201c[h]ighly relevant\u2014if not\nessential\u2014to [the] selection of an appropriate sentence is the\npossession of the fullest information possible concerning the\ndefendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201dId., at 247.\nPermitting sentencing courts to consider the widest possible\nbreadth of information about a defendant \u201censures that the\npunishment will suit not merely the offense but the individual\ndefendant.\u201dWasmanv.United States,468 U. S. 559, 564\n(1984).In 1970, Congress codified the \u201clongstanding\nprinciple that sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider\nvarious kinds of information\u201d at 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73577 (1970 ed.).United Statesv.Watts,519 U. S. 148, 151\n(1997)(per curiam). Section 3577 (1970 ed.) provided:\u201cNo limitationshall be placed on the\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a\nperson convicted of an offense which a court of the United States\nmay receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate\nsentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a73551et seq., Congress effected fundamental\nchanges to federal sentencing by creating the Federal Sentencing\nCommission and introducing the Guidelines scheme. In doing so,\nhowever, Congress recodified \u00a73577 without change at \u00a73661. The\nSentencing Commission, moreover, expressly incorporated \u00a73661 in\nthe Guidelines:\u201cIn determining the sentence to impose within the\nguideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is\nwarranted, the court may consider,without limitation, any\ninformation concerning the background, character and conduct of the\ndefendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.See18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a73661.\u201d USSG \u00a71B1.4 (2010) (emphasis added).Both Congress and the Sentencing Commission thus\nexpressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentencing courts\nto \u201cconduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as\nto the kind of information [they] may consider, or the source from\nwhich it may come.\u201dUnited Statesv.Tucker,404 U. S. 443,\n446 (1972).[Footnote 8]The SRA did constrain sentencing courts\u2019\ndiscretion in important respects, most notably by making the\nGuidelines mandatory, see 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV), and by specifying various factors that courts must\nconsider in exercising their discretion, see \u00a73553(a). In our\nseminal decision inBooker, we held that where facts found\nby a judge by a preponderance of the evidence increased the\napplicable Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory\nin those circumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of\ncriminal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every element\nof an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.\n543 U. S., at 243\u2013244. Our remedial opinion inBookerinvalidated two offending provisions in the SRA, seeid.,\nat 245 (invalidating 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and\ninstructed the district courts to treat the Guidelines as\n\u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d 543 U. S., at 245.Our post-Bookeropinions make clear\nthat, although a sentencing court must \u201cgive respectful\nconsideration to the Guidelines,Bookerpermits the court\nto tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as\nwell.\u201dKimbroughv.United States,552 U. S. 85, 101 (2007)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly,\nalthough the \u201cGuidelines should be the starting point and the\ninitial benchmark,\u201d district courts may impose sentences within\nstatutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the\nfactors listed in \u00a73553(a), subject to appellate review for\n\u201creasonableness.\u201dGall, 552 U. S., at 49\u201351. This\nsentencing framework applies both at a defendant\u2019s initial\nsentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a sentence has\nbeen set aside on appeal. See 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(g) (\u201cA\ndistrict court to which a case is remanded \u2026 shall resentence a\ndefendant in accordance with section 3553\u201d); see alsoDillonv.United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10) (distinguishing between\n\u201csentence-modification proceedings\u201d under 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73582(c)(2), which \u201cdo not implicate the interests identified inBooker,\u201d and \u201cplenary resentencing proceedings,\u201d which\ndo).BIn light of the federal\nsentencing framework described above, we think it clear that when a\ndefendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case\nremanded for resentencing, a district court may consider evidence\nof a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and that\nsuch evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward\nvariance from the advisory Guidelines range.Preliminarily, Congress could not\nhave been clearer in directing that \u201c[n]o limitation \u2026 be placed on\nthe information concerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d\nof a defendant that a district court may \u201creceive and consider for\nthe purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73661. The plain language of \u00a73661 makes no distinction between a\ndefendant\u2019s initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing after\na prior sentence has been set aside on appeal. We have recognized\nthat \u201cthe broad language of \u00a73661\u201d does not provide \u201cany basis for\nthe courts to invent a blanket prohibition against considering\ncertain types of evidence at sentencing.\u201dWatts, 519 U.\nS., at 152. A categorical bar on the consideration of\npostsentencing rehabilitation evidence would directly contravene\nCongress\u2019 expressed intent in \u00a73661.In addition, evidence of postsentencing\nrehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the \u00a73553(a)\nfactors that Congress has expressly instructed district courts to\nconsider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsentencing\nrehabilitation may plainly be relevant to \u201cthe history and\ncharacteristics of the defendant.\u201d \u00a73553(a)(1). Such evidence may\nalso be pertinent to \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u201d to serve\nthe general purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a73553(a)(2)\u2014in\nparticular, to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d\n\u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d and\n\u201cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining \u2026 or other correctional treatment in the most ef-fective\nmanner.\u201d \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B)\u2013(D); seeMcMannus, 496\nF.\u00a03d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (\u201cIn assessing \u2026\ndeterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(B)(C) & (D), there would seem to be no\nbetter evidence than a defendant\u2019s post-incarceration conduct\u201d).\nPostsentencing rehabilitation may also critically inform a\nsentencing judge\u2019s overarching duty under \u00a73553(a) to \u201cimpose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with\nthe sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a73553(a)(2).As the original sentencing judge recognized,\nthe extensive evidence of Pepper\u2019s rehabilitation since his initial\nsentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate\nsentence in this case. Most fundamentally, evidence of Pepper\u2019s\nconduct since his release from custody in June 2005 provides the\nmost up-to-date picture of Pepper\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d\n\u00a73553(a)(1); seeUnited Statesv.Bryson, 229\nF.\u00a03d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s duty is always to\nsentence the defendant as he stands before the court on the day of\nsentencing\u201d). At the time of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper\nwas a 25-year-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from\nhis family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a\nmethamphetamine conspiracy. By the time of his second resentencing\nin 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for nearly five years, had\nattended college and achieved high grades, was a top employee at\nhis job slated for a promotion, had re-established a relationship\nwith his father, and was married and supporting his wife\u2019s\ndaughter. There is no question that this evidence of Pepper\u2019s\nconduct since his initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of\nthe \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d of a defendant that Congress\nintended sentencing courts to consider. \u00a73553(a).Pepper\u2019s postsentencing conduct also sheds\nlight on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal\nconduct, a central factor that district courts must assess when\nimposing sentence. See \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B)\u2013(C);Gall, 552 U.\nS., at 59 (\u201cGall\u2019s self-motivated rehabilitation \u2026 lends strong\nsupport to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to\ndeter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect\nthe public from his future criminal acts\u201d (citing\n\u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B)\u2013(C))). As recognized by Pepper\u2019s probation officer,\nPepper\u2019s steady employment, as well as his successful completion of\na 500-hour drug treatment program and his drug-free condition, also\nsuggest a diminished need for \u201ceducational or vocation- al training\n\u2026 or other correctional treatment.\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(D). Finally,\nPepper\u2019s exemplary postsentencing conduct may be taken as the most\naccurate indicator of \u201chis present purposes and tendencies and\nsignificantly to suggest the period of restraint and the kind of\ndiscipline that ought to be imposed upon him.\u201dAshe, 302\nU. S., at 55. Accordingly, evidence of Pepper\u2019s postsentencing\nrehabilitation bears directly on the District Court\u2019s overarching\nduty to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing. \u00a73553(a).In sum, the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling\nprohibiting the District Court from considering any evidence of\nPepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts\nwith longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and\ncontravenes Congress\u2019 directives in \u00a7\u00a73661 and 3553(a).CAmicusnevertheless\nadvances two principal arguments in defense of the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 ruling: (1) 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(g)(2), which restricts\nthe discretion of a resentencing court on remand to impose a\nnon-Guidelines sentence, effectively forecloses consideration of a\ndefendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting\ndistrict courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would\ndefeat Congress\u2019 objectives under \u00a73553(a). We are not\npersuaded.1Amicus\u2019 main argument\nrelies on 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(g)(2), a provision that the Court\nof Appeals did not cite below. That provision states that when a\nsentence is set aside on appeal, the district court to which the\ncase is remanded:\u201cshall not impose a sentence outside the applicable\nguidelines range except upon a ground that\u2014\u201c(A) was specifically and affirmatively\nincluded in the written statement of reasons required by section\n3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant\nprior to the appeal; and\u201c(B) was held by the court of appeals, in\nremanding the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.\u201dIn operation, \u00a73742(g)(2) restricts the discretion\nof a district court on remand by precluding the court from imposing\na sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a \u201cground of\ndeparture\u201d that was expressly relied upon in the prior sentencing\nand upheld on appeal.Amicusthus correctly contends that,\non its face, \u00a73742(g)(2) effectively forecloses a resentencing\ncourt from considering evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentencing\nrehabilitation for purposes of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence\nbecause, as a practical matter, such evidence did not exist at the\ntime of the prior sentencing. As the Government concedes, however,\n\u00a73742(g)(2) is invalid afterBooker.As we have explained,Bookerheld\nthat where judicial factfinding increases a defendant\u2019s applicable\nSentencing Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory\nin those circumstances would violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every element of\nan offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. Seesupra, at 11. We recognized inBookerthat,\nalthough the SRA permitted departures from the applicable\nGuidelines range in limited circumstances,[Footnote 9] \u201cdepartures are not available in every\ncase, and in fact are unavailable in most.\u201d 543 U. S., at 234.\nBecause in those instances, \u201cthe judge is bound to impose a\nsentence within the Guidelines range,\u201d we concluded that the\navailability of departures in certain circumstances \u201cdoes not avoid\nthe constitutional issue.\u201dIbid.To remedy the constitutional problem, we\nrendered the Guidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two\nprovisions of the SRA: 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose a\nsentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and \u00a73742(e) (2000\ned. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of appellate\nreview, includingde novoreview of Guidelines departures.\n543 U. S., at 259. We invalidated these provisions even though we\nrecognized that mandatory application of the Guidelines would not\nalways result in a Sixth Amendment violation.[Footnote 10] Indeed, although the Government\nsuggested inBookerthat we render the Guidelines advisory\nonly in cases in which the Constitution prohibits judicial\nfactfinding, we rejected that two-track proposal, reasoning that\n\u201cCongress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some\ncases and a non-mandatory system in others, given the\nadministrative complexities that such a system would create.\u201dId., at 266; seeDillon, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (\u201cThe incomplete remedy we rejected inBookerwould have required courts to treat the Guidelines differently in\nsimilar proceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and\nconsiderable administrative challenges\u201d).We did not expressly mention\n\u00a73742(g)(2) inBooker,[Footnote 11] but the rationale we set forth in that\nopinion for invalidating \u00a7\u00a73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) applies equally\nto \u00a73742(g)(2). As with those provisions, \u00a73742(g)(2) requires\ndistrict courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in\nan entire set of cases. Specifically, \u00a73742(g)(2) precludes a\ndistrict court on remand from imposing a sentence \u201coutside the\napplicable guidelines range\u201d except upon a \u201cground of departure\u201d\nthat was expressly relied upon by the court at the prior sentencing\nand upheld by the court of appeals. In circumstances in which the\ndistrict court did not rely upon such a departure ground at the\nprior sentencing, \u00a73742(g)(2) would require the court on remand to\nimpose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, thus\nrendering the Guidelines effectively mandatory. Because in a large\nset of cases, judicial factfinding will increase the applicable\nGuidelines range beyond that supported solely by the facts\nestablished by the jury verdict (or guilty plea), requiring a\nsentencing judge on remand to apply the Guidelines range, as\n\u00a73742(g)(2) does, will often result in a Sixth Amendment violation\nfor the reasons we explained inBooker. Accordingly, as\nwith the provisions inBooker, the proper remedy here is\nto invalidate \u00a73742(g)(2).The sentencing proceeding at issue inBookeritself illustrates why \u00a73742(g)(2) cannot withstand\nSixth Amendment scrutiny. The district court inBookerincreased the defendant\u2019s then-mandatory Guidelines range based on\na drug-quantity finding that it, rather than the jury, made. 543 U.\nS., at 227. After we held that the Guidelines must be treated as\nadvisory, we remanded the case for resentencing.Id., at\n267. Had \u00a73742(g)(2) remained valid afterBooker, the\ndistrict court on remand would have been required to sentence\nwithin the Guidelines range because it did not depart from the\nGuidelines at the original sentencing. Accordingly, the\nresentencing judge inBookerwould have been required\nunder \u00a73742(g)(2) to impose a Guidelines sentence based on\njudge-found facts concerning drug quantity, the precise result thatBookerforbids.The same result would occur in any sentencing\nin which a district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence\noutside the Guidelines range \u201cbased on a misunderstanding of its\nauthority to depart under or vary from the Guidelines.\u201d Reply Brief\nfor United States 16. For example, if \u00a73742(g)(2) remained valid,\nthere would be no remedy at resentencing if a district court\nerroneously believed the Guidelines were presumptively reasonable,\nseeNelsonv.United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009)(per curiam)(slip op., at 2), or if it mistakenly\nthought that a non-Guidelines sentence required extraordinary\ncircumstances, seeGall, 552 U. S., at 47, or if it\nincorrectly concluded that it could not vary from the Guidelines\nbased on a policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine, seeKimbrough, 552 U. S., at\n101. In such cases, the district court at the initial sentencing\nproceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence within the\nGuidelines range, and thus \u00a73742(g)(2) would require the imposition\nof a Guidelines sentence on remand. See Reply Brief for Petitioner\n3\u20135 (describing further categories of cases where \u201ctheBookerremedy would be entirely unavailable if \u00a73742(g)(2)\nwere valid\u201d).To be sure, applying \u00a73742(g)(2) at\nresentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. For example, where the applicable Guidelines range rests\nsolely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\napplication of \u00a73742(g)(2) at resentencing would not render the\nsentence constitutionally infirm. But, as explained above, that\npossibility was equally true with respect to the sentencing\nprovisions we invalidated inBooker. Seesupra,\nat 16. As with those provisions, \u201cwe cannot assume that Congress,\nif faced with the statute\u2019s invalidity in key applications, would\nhave preferred to apply the statute in as many other instances as\npossible.\u201d 543 U. S., at 248. Just as we rejected a two-track\nsystem inBookerthat would have made the Guidelines\nmandatory in some cases and advisory in others, we reject a partial\ninvalidation of \u00a73742(g)(2) that would leave us with the same\nresult.The fact that \u00a73742(g)(2) permits a\nresentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in\ncases where the prior sentence expressly relied upon a departure\nupheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the\nconstitutional infirmity. As explained above, we observed inBookerthat the availability of departures from the\napplicable Guidelines ranges in specified circumstances \u201cdoes not\navoid the constitutional issue.\u201dId., at 234. Because\n\u201cdepartures are not available in every case, and in fact are\nunavailable in most,\u201dibid., we held that remedying the\nSixth Amendment problem required invalidation of \u00a73553(b)(1). That\nsame remedial approach requires us to invalidate\n\u00a73742(g)(2).[Footnote\n12]Amicuscontends that any\nconstitutional infirmity in \u00a73742(g)(2) can be remedied by\ninvalidating \u00a73742(j)(1)(B) rather than \u00a73742(g)(2). Brief forAmicus Curiaein Support of Judgment Below 21\u201322. Section\n3742(j)(1)(B) provides that a \u201cground of departure\u201d is\n\u201cpermissible\u201d for purposes of \u00a73742(g)(2)(B) only if it is,inter alia, \u201cauthorized under section 3553(b).\u201d InBooker, we noted that \u201cstatutory cross-references\u201d to the\nSRA provisions we invalidated were also constitutionally infirm.\n543 U. S., at 259. Because \u00a73742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a\ncross-reference to \u00a73553(b)(1), one of the provisions we\ninvalidated inBooker,amicussuggests that\ninvalidating \u00a73742(j)(1)(B) would cure any constitutional defect in\n\u00a73742(g)(2)(B). As the Government explains, however, even if\n\u00a73742(j)(1)(B) were invalidated and a district court could depart\non any ground at an initial sentencing, the district court would\nnot be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing so long as\n\u00a73742(g)(2) remains in force. Becauseamicus\u2019 proposed\nsolution would still result in the Guidelines being effectively\nmandatory at resentencing in an entire set of cases, it fails to\nremedy the fundamental constitutional defect of \u00a73742(g)(2).2Amicus\u2019 next cluster of\narguments focuses on Con- gress\u2019 sentencing objectives under\n\u00a73553(a). Preliminarily,amicuscontends that even if\n\u00a73742(g)(2) is constitutionally invalid, that provision reflects a\ncongressional policy determination that only information available\nat the time of original sentencing should be considered, and that\nthis policy determination should inform our analysis of whether\n\u00a73553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation\nevidence. This argument, however, is based on a faulty premise.Contrary toamicus\u2019\ncontention, \u00a73742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to\npreclude consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation\nat resentencing. To be sure, \u00a73742(g)(2) has the incidental effect\nof limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on\npostsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from\nresentencing outside the Guidelines range on a \u201cground of\ndeparture\u201d on which it did not previously rely. But on its face,\nnothing in \u00a73742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from considering\npostsentencing developments\u2014including postsentencing\nrehabilitation\u2014in selecting a sentencewithinthe\napplicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2) also does not apply\nto resentencings that occur for reasons other than when a sentence\nis overturned on appeal and the case is remanded (e.g.,\nwhen a sentence is set aside on collateral review under 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72255). In such circumstances, \u00a73742(g)(2) does not\nrestrict a district court at all, much less with respect to\nconsideration of postsentencing developments. Accordingly, because\nwe see no general congressional policy reflected in \u00a73742(g)(2) to\npreclude resentencing courts from considering postsentencing\ninformation,[Footnote 13]\nthat provision has no bearing on our analysis of whether \u00a73553(a)\npermits consideration of evidence of postsentencing\nrehabilitation.As we explained above, evidence of\npostsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of\nthe sentencing factors that Congress has specifically instructed\ndistrict courts to consider. Seesupra, at 13\u201315\n(discussing \u00a7\u00a73553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)\u2013(D)).Amicus,\nhowever, argues that consideration of postsentencing\nreha-bilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors:\n\u00a73553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider \u201cany\npertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing Commission, and\n\u00a73553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider \u201cthe need to avoid\nunwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities among defendants with similar\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201dWith regard to \u00a73553(a)(5),amicuspoints to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in USSG\n\u00a75K2.19, which provides that \u201c[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative\nefforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after\nimposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense[,] are\nnot an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing\nthe defendant for that offense.\u201d According toamicus, that\npolicy statement is \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d and as an exercise of\nthe Sentencing Commission\u2019s \u201ccore function,\u201d should be given\neffect. Brief forAmicus Curiaein Support of Judgment\nBelow 31\u201332.To be sure, we have recognized that the\nCommission post-Bookercontinues to \u201cfil[l] an important\ninstitutional role\u201d because \u201c[i]t has the capacity courts lack to\nbase its determinations on empirical data and national experience,\nguided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\u201dKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 109 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, we have instructed that district courts must\nstill give \u201crespectful consideration\u201d to the now-advisory\nGuidelines (and their accompanying policy statements).Id., at 101. Asamicusacknowledges, however, our\npost-Bookerdecisions make clear that a district court may\nin appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a\ndisagreement with the Commission\u2019s views. Seeid., at\n109\u2013110. That is particularly true where, as here, the Commission\u2019s\nviews rest on wholly unconvincing policy rationales not reflected\nin the sentencing statutes Congress enacted.The commentary to USSG \u00a75K2.19 expresses the\nCommission\u2019s view that departures based on postsentencing\nrehabilitation would \u201c(1) be inconsistent with the policies\nestablished by Congress under 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(b) [governing\ngood time credit] and other statutory provisions for reducing the\ntime to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably\nbenefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentencedde novo.\u201d With regard to the first proffered rationale, a\nsentencing reduction based on postsentencing rehabilitation can\nhardly be said to be \u201cinconsistent with the policies\u201d underlying an\naward of good time credit under \u00a73624(b) because the two serve\ndistinctly different penological interests.[Footnote 14] Indeed, the difference between the\ntwo is reflected most obviously in the fact that the BOP has no\nauthority to award good time credit where, as in this case, the\ndefendant\u2019s good behavior occurs after a sentence has already been\nserved.[Footnote 15] The\nCommission\u2019s second proffered rationale fares no better. To be\nsure, allowing district courts to consider evidence of\npostsentencing rehabilitation may result in disparate treatment\nbetween those defendants who are sentenced properly and those who\nmust be resentenced. But that disparity arises not because of\narbitrary or random sentencing practices, but because of the\nordinary operation of appellate sentencing review.In a closely related vein,amicusargues that consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is\ninconsistent with \u00a73553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to\nconsider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. The\nCourt of Appeals also rested its holding on this ground, reasoning\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018allowing [postsentencing rehabilitation] evidence to\ninfluence [defendant\u2019s] sentence would be grossly unfair to the\nvast majority of defendants who receive no sentencing-court review\nof any positive post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 570\nF.\u00a03d, at 965 (quotingMcMannus, 496 F.\u00a03d, at\n852, n.\u00a04). Butamicuspoints to no evidence, nor are\nwe aware of any, suggesting that Congress enacted \u00a73553(a)(6) out\nof a concern with disparities resulting from the normal trial and\nsentencing process.[Footnote\n16] The differences in procedural opportunity that may result\nbecause some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must\nbe resentenced are not the kinds of \u201cunwarranted\u201d sentencing\ndisparities that Congress sought to eliminate under \u00a73553(a)(6).\nCf.United Statesv.LaBonte,520 U. S. 751, 761\u2013762\n(1997) (disparity arising from exercise of prosecutorial discretion\nnot unwarranted);United Statesv.Rhodes, 145\nF.\u00a03d 1375, 1381 (CADC 1998) (\u201cDistinguishing between\nprisoners whose convictions are reversed on appeal and all other\nprisoners hardly seems \u2018unwarranted\u2019\u00a0\u201d).As the Government explains, moreover, the\nlogic of the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach below\u2014i.e., that\n\u201cpost-sentence rehabilitation is not relevant .\u00a0. . because\nthe district court could not have considered that evidence at the\ntime of the original sentencing,\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 965 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014would require sentencing courts\ncategorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation, butanypostsentencing information, including, for example,\nevidence that a defendant had committed postsentencing offenses.\nOur precedents, however, provide no basis to support such a\ncategorical bar. See,e.g.,Wasman, 468 U. S., at\n572 (\u201c[A] sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by\naffirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred\nsubsequent to the original sentencing proceedings\u201d); cf.North\nCarolinav.Pearce,395 U. S. 711, 723\n(1969). Indeed, even the Court of Appeals below does not accept the\nlogical consequence of its approach as it permits district courts\nto consider postsentencing conduct that would support a higher\nsentence. SeeUnited Statesv.Stapleton, 316\nF.\u00a03d 754, 757 (CA8 2003). Nothing in \u00a7\u00a73553(a) and 3661,\nhowever, remotely suggests that Congress intended district courts\nto consider only postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant\nwhile turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defendant\u2019s\npostsentencing rehabilitation. Cf.United Statesv.Jones, 460 F.\u00a03d 191, 196 (CA2 2006) (\u201cObviously, the\ndiscretion thatBookeraccords sentencing judges to impose\nnon-Guidelines sentences cannot be an escalator that only goes\nup\u201d).Finally, we note that \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(5) and (a)(6)\ndescribe only two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must\nconsider in imposing sentence. At root,amicuseffectively\ninvites us to elevate two \u00a73553(a) factors above all others. We\nreject that invitation. SeeGall, 552 U. S., at 49\u201350\n(instructing sentencing courts to \u201cconsiderallof the\n\u00a73553(a) factors\u201d (emphasis added)).DFor the reasons stated above, we\nhold that the Court of Appeals erred in categorically precluding\nthe District Court from considering evidence of Pepper\u2019s\npostsentencing rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set\naside on appeal. District courts post-Bookermay consider\nevidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation at\nresentencing and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a\ndownward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.[Footnote 17]The Government informs us that,\nin granting Pepper\u2019s motion for release pending disposition of this\nappeal, see n.\u00a05,supra, the District Court stated\nthat it would not have exercised its discretion to grant Pepper a\ndownward variance based on postsentencing rehabilitation. That\nstatement, however, was made in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019\nerroneous views regarding postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.\nBecause we expressly reject those views today, it is unclear from\nthe record whether the District Court would have imposed the same\nsentence had it properly considered the extensive evidence of\nPepper\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation. On remand, the District\nCourt should consider and give appropriate weight to that evidence,\nas well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper\u2019s conduct\nsince his last sentencing in January 2009. Accordingly, we vacate\nthe Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment in respect to Pepper\u2019s sentence and\nremand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.IIIThe second question presented in\nthis case merits only a brief discussion. As noted above, the\noriginal sentencing judge in this case granted Pepper a 40 percent\ndownward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a75K1.1 based on Pepper\u2019s\nsubstantial assistance and sentenced him to 24 months\u2019\nimprisonment. When the Court of Appeals vacated that sentence inPepper II, and again inPepper III, the case was\nreassigned on remand to Chief Judge Reade. In resentencing Pepper,\nChief Judge Reade ruled that she was not bound by the prior\nsentencing judge\u2019s decision to grant a 40 percent downward\ndeparture and instead granted only a 20 percent downward departure,\nwhich the Court of Appeals upheld inPepper IV. Pepper\nargues that the law of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade\nto apply the same 40 percent departure granted by the original\nsentencing judge. We disagree.Preliminarily, we note that the\nmandates inPepper IIandPepper IIIwere\n\u201cgeneral remand[s] for resentencing,\u201d which \u201cdid not place any\nlimitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court\njudge in resentencing Pepper.\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 963. In his\nmerits briefs to this Court, Pepper does not challenge the scope or\nvalidity of the Court of Appeals\u2019 mandate orderingde novoresentencing, and thus has abandoned any argument that the mandate\nitself restricted the District Court from imposing a different\nsubstantial assistance departure.[Footnote 18] The only question before us is whether the\nlaw of the case doctrine required Chief Judge Reade to adhere to\nthe original sentencing judge\u2019s decision granting a 40 percent\ndownward departure.Although we have described the \u201claw of the\ncase [a]s an amorphous concept,\u201d \u201c[a]s most commonly defined, the\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that\ndecision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent\nstages in the same case.\u201dArizonav.California,460 U. S. 605,\n618 (1983). This doctrine \u201cdirects a court\u2019s discretion, it does\nnot limit the tribunal\u2019s power.\u201dIbid.Accordingly, the\ndoctrine \u201cdoes not apply if the court is \u2018convinced that [its prior\ndecision] is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest\ninjustice.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAgostiniv.Felton,521 U. S. 203, 236\n(1997) (quotingArizona, 460 U. S., at 618, n.\u00a08;\nalteration in original).Pepper argues that, because the original\nsentencing judge\u2019s decision to grant the 40 percent departure was\nnever set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it\nconstituted the law of the case. As such, Pepper contends that\nChief Judge Reade should not have disturbed that ruling absent\n\u201ccompelling justification\u201d for overturning it. Brief for Petitioner\n56. According to Pepper, because Chief Judge Reade identified no\nsuch justification, the law of the case doctrine required her to\nadhere to the 40 percent departure granted by the original\nsentencing judge.As the Government explains, however, the Court\nof Appeals inPepper IIIset aside Pepper\u2019s entire\nsentence and remanded for ade novoresentencing. See 518\nF.\u00a03d, at 949, 953. Thus, even assuming,arguendo,\nthat the original sentencing court\u2019s decision to impose a 40\npercent departure was at one point law of the case,Pepper\nIIIeffectively wiped the slate clean. To be sure,Pepper\nIIIvacated Pepper\u2019s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated to\nthe substantial assistance departure, but that fact does not affect\nour conclusion. \u201cA criminal sentence is a package of sanctions that\nthe district court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent.\u201dUnited Statesv.Stinson, 97 F.\u00a03d 466, 469\n(CA11 1996)(per curiam).

That is precisely what the Eighth Circuit did here.Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals inPepper IIIremanded forde novoresentencing, we\nconclude that Chief Judge Reade was not bound by the law of the\ncase doctrine to apply the same 40 percent departure that had been\napplied at Pepper\u2019s prior sentencing.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the reasons stated above, the\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit is vacated in part and affirmed in part, and the case is\nremanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.Footnote 1Although the charge to which Pepper pleaded\nguilty carried a mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the\nmandatory minimum did not apply because he was eligible for\nsafety-valve relief pursuant to 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(f) (2000\ned.) and \u00a75C1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n(Nov. 2003) (USSG).Footnote 2USSG \u00a75K1.1 provides that a court may depart\nfrom the Guidelines \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that\nthe defendant has provided substantial assistance in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an\noffense.\u201d Pepper provided information to Government investigators\nand a grand jury concerning two other individuals involved with\nillegal drugs and guns.Footnote 3The court also cited Pepper\u2019s lack of a\nviolent history and, to a lesser extent, the need to avoid\nunwarranted sentencing disparity with Pepper\u2019s co-conspirators.\nApp. 144\u2013145.Footnote 4The Court of Appeals also held that the\nDistrict Court \u201cfurther erred by considering Pepper\u2019s lack of\nviolent history, which history had already been accounted for in\nthe sentencing Guidelines calculation, and by considering\nsentencing disparity among Pepper\u2019s co-defendants without adequate\nfoundation and explanation.\u201dPepper II, 486 F.\u00a03d, at\n413.Footnote 5After the District Court resentenced Pepper\nto 65 months\u2019 imprisonment, Pepper was returned to federal custody.\nOn July 22, 2010, after we granted Pepper\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, the District Court granted his motion for release\npending disposition of the case here.Footnote 6Compare,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Lorenzo, 471 F.\u00a03d 1219, 1221 (CA11\n2006)(per curiam)(precluding consideration of\npostsentencing rehabilitative conduct);United Statesv.Sims, 174 F.\u00a03d 911, 913 (CA8 1999) (same), withUnited Statesv.Lloyd, 469 F.\u00a03d 319, 325\n(CA3 2006) (permitting consideration of postsentencing\nrehabilitation in exceptional cases);United Statesv.Hughes, 401 F.\u00a03d 540, 560, n.\u00a019 (CA4 2005)\n(instructing district court to adjust Guidelines calculation on\nremand \u201cif new circumstances have arisen or events occurred since\n[defendant] was sentenced that impact the range prescribed by the\nguidelines\u201d).Footnote 7We appointed Adam G. Ciongoli to brief and\nargue the case, asamicus curiae, in support of the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 judgment. 561 U. S. ___ (2010). Mr. Ciongoli has ably\ndischarged his assigned responsibilities.Footnote 8Of course, sentencing courts\u2019 discretion\nunder \u00a73661 is subject to constitutional constraints. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Leung, 40\nF.\u00a03d 577, 586 (CA2 1994) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s race or nationality\nmay play no adverse role in the administration of justice,\nincluding at sentencing\u201d).Footnote 9See 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV) (permitting departures where the judge \u201cfinds that there\nexists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a\ndegree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing\nCommission\u201d).Footnote 10For example, in the pre-Bookerregime, if the applicable Guidelines range depended solely on facts\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, requiring a judge to\nsentence within that range would not run afoul of the Sixth\nAmendment.Footnote 11SeeDillon, 560 U. S., at ___,\nn.\u00a05 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9, n.\u00a05)\n(citing \u00a73742(g)(2) as \u201cone additional provision of the [SRA that]\nshould have been excised, but was not, in order to accomplish the\nCourt\u2019s remedy\u201d).Footnote 12AmicusNational Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) argues that, because\n\u00a73742(g)(2)(B) permits a non-Guidelines sentence only with respect\nto certain \u201cdepartures,\u201d that provision \u201cappears to preclude\nsentencing courts on remand from granting any and allvariancesunder Section 3553(a).\u201d Brief for NACDL asAmicusCuriae11 (emphasis added). InIrizarryv.United States,553 U. S. 708(2008), we\nheld that a \u201c\u00a0\u2018[d]eparture\u2019 is a term of art under the\nGuidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed\nunder the framework set out in the Guidelines\u201d; in contrast, a\n\u201cvariance\u201d refers to a non-Guidelines sentence outside the\nGuidelines framework.Id., at 714.Irizarry\u2019s\nholding construed the term \u201cdeparture\u201d in Rule 32(h) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure. Because we conclude that \u00a73742(g)(2)\nis constitutionally infirm and must be invalidated, we need not\ndecide whether its reference to \u201cdeparture[s]\u201d includes\nvariances.Footnote 13For those of us for whom it is relevant, the\nlegislative history of \u00a73742(g)(2) confirms that the provision,\nenacted as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003, \u00a7401(e), 117 Stat. 671,\nwas not aimed at prohibiting district courts from considering\npostsentencing developments. Rather, it was meant to ensure that\nunder the then-mandatory Guidelines system, when a particular\ndeparture was reversed on appeal, the district court could not\nimpose the same sentence on remand on the basis of a different\ndeparture. See H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 108\u201366, pp. 58\u201359 (2003)\n(noting that \u00a7401 of the PROTECT Act,inter alia,\n\u201cprevent[s] sentencing courts, upon remand, from imposing the same\nillegal departure on a different theory\u201d). Like the provisions\ninvalidated inBooker, then, the purpose of \u00a73742(g)(2)\nwas \u201cto make Guidelines sentencing even more mandatory than it had\nbeen.\u201d 543 U. S. 220, 261 (2005). As we recognized inBooker, that purpose has \u201cceased to be relevant.\u201dIbid.Footnote 14An award of good time credit by the Bureau of\nPrisons (BOP) does not affect the length of a court-imposed\nsentence; rather, it is an administrative reward \u201cto provide an\nincentive for prisoners to \u2018compl[y] with institutional\ndisciplinary regulations.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBarberv.Thomas, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7)\n(quoting 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(b); alteration in original). Such\ncredits may be revoked at any time before the date of a prisoner\u2019s\nrelease. See \u00a73624(b)(2). In contrast, a court\u2019s imposition of a\nreduced sentence based on postsentencing rehabilitation changes the\nvery terms of imprisonment and \u201crecognizes that the [defendant\u2019s]\nconduct since his initial sentencing warrants a less severe\ncriminal punishment.\u201d Brief for United States 50. Once imposed, a\nsentence may be modified only in very limited circumstances. See\n\u00a73582(c).Footnote 15Amicuspoints to two other\nprocedural mechanisms that may shorten a defendant\u2019s sentence\u2014early\ntermination of a term of supervised release, see \u00a73583(e)(1), and\nthe potential for sentencing reductions based on postsentencing\nsubstantial assistance, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b)\u2014but neither\npresents an adequate substitute for a district court\u2019s\nconsideration of postsentencing rehabilitation. Supervised release\nfollows a term of imprisonment and serves an entirely different\npurpose than the sentence imposed under \u00a73553(a). SeeUnited\nStatesv.Johnson,529 U. S. 53, 59 (2000)\n(\u201cSupervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from\nthose served by incarceration\u201d). Rule 35(b) departures address only\npostsentencing cooperation with the Government, not postsentencing\nrehabilitation generally, and thus a defendant with nothing to\noffer the Government can gain no benefit from Rule 35(b).Footnote 16Indeed, some defendants will have a longer\nperiod of time between initial custody and trial, or between trial\nand sentencing, and those defendants\u2014particularly if they are\nreleased on bail\u2014will have a greater opportunity to demonstrate\npostoffense, presentencing rehabilitation. Even beforeBooker, the lower courts uniformly held that evidence of\nsuch rehabilitation could provide a basis for departing from the\napplicable Guidelines. See USSG App. C, Amdt. 602, comment.,\np.\u00a074 (Nov. 2003) (\u201c[D]epartures based on extraordinary\npost-offense rehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing \u2026 have been\nallowed by every circuit that has ruled on the matter\u201d).Footnote 17Of course, we do not mean to imply that a\ndistrict court must reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence upon any showing\nof postsentencing rehabilitation. Nor do we mean to preclude courts\nof appeals from issuing limited remand orders, in appropriate\ncases, that may render evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation\nirrelevant in light of the narrow purposes of the remand\nproceeding. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Bernardo Sanchez, 569 F.\u00a03d 995, 1000 (CA9 2009).Footnote 18In any event, as the Court of Appeals\nrecognized, neitherPepper IInorPepper IIIheld\nthat a 40 percent downward departure was the only reasonable\ndeparture that a sentencing court could grant for Pepper\u2019s\nsubstantial assistance; rather, the only issue those opinions\nactually decided was that a \u201c40% downward departure was not an\nabuse of discretion.\u201d 570 F.\u00a03d, at 963\u2013964.",
