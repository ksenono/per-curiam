SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE\nINTERIOR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS11\u2013247v.DAVID PATCHAK et\u00a0al.on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit[June 18, 2012]Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.In enacting the Quiet Title Act (QTA), Congress\nwaived the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity in cases seeking \u201cto\nadjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72409a(a). In so\ndoing, Congress was careful to retain the Government\u2019s sovereign\nimmunity with respect to particular claimants, particular\ncategories of land, and particular remedies. Congress and the\nExecutive Branch considered these \u201ccarefully crafted provisions\u201d\nessential to the immunity waiver and \u201cnecessary for the protection\nof the national public interest.\u201dBlockv.North Dakota\nex\u00a0rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands,461 U.S.\n273, 284\u2013285 (1983).The Court\u2019s opinion sanctions an end-run around\nthese vital limitations on the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. After today, any person may sue under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA) to divest the Federal Government of title to\nand possession of land held in trust for Indian tribes\u2014relief\nexpressly forbidden by the QTA\u2014so long as the complaint does not\nassert a personal interest in the land. That outcome cannot be\nsquared with the APA\u2019s express admonition that it confers no\n\u201cauthority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent\nto suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.\u201d\n5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702. The Court\u2019s holding not only creates\nperverse incentives for private litigants, but also exposes the\nGovernment\u2019s ownership of land to costly and prolonged challenges.\nBecause I believe those results to be inconsistent with the QTA and\nthe APA, I respectfully dissent.IACongress enacted the QTA to provide a\ncomprehensive solution to the problem of real-property disputes\nbetween private parties and the United States. The QTA strikes a\ncareful balance between private parties\u2019 desire to adjudicate such\ndisputes, and the Government\u2019s desire to impose \u201c\u00a0\u2018appropriate\nsafeguards\u2019\u00a0\u201d on any waiver of sovereign immunity to ensure\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the protection of the public interest.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 282\u2013283; see also S.\u00a0Rep. No.\n92\u2013575, p.\u00a06 (1971).Section 2409a(a) provides expansively that\n\u201c[t]he United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil\naction under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d That\nlanguage mirrors the title proposed by the Executive Branch for the\nlegislation that Congress largely adopted: \u201cA Bill To permit suits\nto adjudicate disputed titles to lands in which the United States\nclaims an interest.\u201dId.,at 7.The remainder of the Act, however, imposes\nimportant conditions upon the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity. First, the right to sue \u201cdoes not apply to trust or\nrestricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). The Indian lands exception\nreflects the view that \u201ca waiver of immunity in this area would not\nbe consistent with specific commitments [the Government] ha[s] made\nto the Indians through treaties and other agreements.\u201dBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 283 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). By exempting Indian lands, Congress ensured that the\nGovernment\u2019s \u201csolemn obligations\u201d to tribes would not be\n\u201cabridg[ed] .\u00a0.\u00a0. without the consent of the Indians.\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 4.Second, the Act preserves the United States\u2019\npower to retain possession or control of any disputed property,\neven if a court determines that the Government\u2019s property claim is\ninvalid. To that end, \u00a72409a(b) \u201callow[s] the United States the\noption of paying money damages instead of surrendering the property\nif it lost a case on the merits.\u201dBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at\n283. This provision was considered essential to addressing the\nGovernment\u2019s \u201cmain objection in the past to waiving sovereign immu-\nnity\u201d where federal land was concerned: that an adverse judgment\n\u201cwould make possible decrees ousting the United States from\npossession and thus interfer[e] with operations of the Government.\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at\u00a05\u20136. Section 2409a(b)\n\u201celiminate[d] cause for such apprehension,\u201d by ensuring that\u2014even\nunder the QTA\u2014the United States could not be stripped of its\npossession or control of property without its consent.Id.,at 6.Finally, the Act limits the class of individuals\npermitted to sue the Government to those claiming a \u201cright, title,\nor interest\u201d in disputed property. \u00a72409a(d). As we have explained,\nCongress\u2019 decision to restrict the class entitled to relief\nindicates that Congress precluded relief for the remainder. See,e.g., Blockv.Community Nutrition Institute,467 U.S.\n340, 349 (1984) (\u201c[W]hen a statute provides a detailed\nmechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the\nbehest of particular persons, judicial review of those issues at\nthe behest of other persons may be found to be impliedly\nprecluded\u201d). That inference is especially strong here, because the\nQTA was \u201cenacted against the backdrop of sovereign immunity.\u201d\nS.\u00a0Rep. No. 94\u2013996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus\nindicates that Congress concluded that those without any \u201cright,\ntitle, or interest\u201d in a given property did not have an inter- est\nsufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government\u2019s sovereign\nimmunity.Congress considered these conditions\nindispensible to its immunity waiver.[1] \u201c[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to legislation\nwaiving the sovereign immunity of the United States, those\nconditions must be strictly observed, and exceptions thereto are\nnot to be lightly implied.\u201dBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 287.\nCongress and the Executive Branch intended the scheme to be the\nexclusive procedure for resolving property title disputes involving\nthe United States. Seeid., at 285 (describing Act as a\n\u201ccareful and thorough remedial scheme\u201d); S.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u2013575,\nat 4 (\u00a72409a \u201cprovides acomplete, thoughtful approach to\nthe problem of disputed titles to federally claimed land\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).For that reason, we held that Congress did not\nintend to create a \u201cnew supplemental remedy\u201d when it enacted the\nAPA\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity.Block, 461\nU.\u00a0S., at 286, n. 22. \u201c\u00a0\u2018It would require the suspension\nof disbelief,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we reasoned, \u201c\u00a0\u2018to ascribe to Congress\nthe design to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to be\ncircumvented by artful pleading.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 285\n(quotingBrownv.GSA,425 U.S.\n820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff could oust the Government of\ntitle to land by means of an APA action, \u201call of the carefully\ncrafted provisions of the QTA deemed necessary for the protection\nof the national public interest could be averted,\u201d and the \u201cIndian\nlands exception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.\u201dBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 284\u2013285.We therefore had\nlittle difficulty concluding that Congress did not intend to render\nthe QTA\u2019s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the right\nto dispute the Government\u2019s title to any lands by way of an APA\naction\u2014and to empower any such plaintiff to \u201cdisposses[s] [the\nUnited States] of the disputed prop- erty without being afforded\nthe option of paying damages.\u201dId.,at 285.It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the\nconditions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the\nGovernment\u2019s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he seeks to\nforce the Government to relinquish possession and title outright,\nleaving it no alternative to pay compensation (strike two); and he\ndoes not claim any personal right, title, or interest in the\nproperty (strike three). Thus, by its express terms, the QTA\nforbids the relief Patchak seeks. Compareante,at 3 (\u201c[A]ll\nparties agree that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the\nFederal Government of title to the [Indian trust] land\u201d), withUnited Statesv.Mottaz,476\nU.S. 834, 842 (1986) (Section 2409a(a)\u2019s Indian lands exclusion\n\u201coperates solely to retain the United States\u2019 immunity from suit by\nthird parties challenging the United States\u2019 title to land held in\ntrust for Indians\u201d). Consequently, Patchak may not avoid the QTA\u2019s\nconstraints by suing under the APA, a statute enacted only four\nyears later. See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702 (rendering the APA\u2019s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity inapplicable \u201cif any other statute\nthat grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the\nrelief which is sought\u201d).BThe majority nonetheless permits Patchak to\ncircumvent the QTA\u2019s limitations by filing an action under the APA.\nIt primarily argues that the careful limitations Con- gress imposed\nupon the QTA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im- munity are \u201csimply\ninapposite\u201d to actions in which the plaintiff advances a different\n\u201cgrievance\u201d to that underlying a QTA suit,i.e.,cases in\nwhich a plaintiff seeks to \u201cstrip the United States of title to the\nland .\u00a0.\u00a0. not on the ground that it is his,\u201d but rather\nbecause \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s decision to take land into trust violates\na federal statute.\u201dAnte,at 7, 10. This analysis is\nunmoored from the text of the APA.Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff\u2019s\nmotivation for suit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his\ncase, but only on whether another statute expressly or impliedly\nforbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly seeks\u2014to\noust the Government of title to Indian trust land\u2014is identical to\nthat forbidden by the QTA. Conversely, the Court\u2019s hypothetical\nsuit, alleging that the Bradley Property was causing environmental\nharm, would not be barred by the QTA. Seeante,at 6. That\nis not because such an action asserts a different \u201cgrievance,\u201d but\nbecause it seeks different relief\u2014abatement of a nuisance rather\nthan the extinguishment of title.[2]In any event, the \u201cgrievance\u201d Patchak asserts is\nno different from that asserted inBlock\u2014a case in which we\nunanimously rejected a plaintiff\u2019s attempt to avoid the QTA\u2019s\nrestrictions by way of an APA action or the similar device of an\nofficer\u2019s suit.[3] That action,\nlike this one, was styled as a suit claiming that the Government\u2019s\nactions respecting land were \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cnot within [its]\nstatutory powers.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d 461 U.\u00a0S., at 281. Cf.ante,at 10 (\u201c[Patchak] asserts merely that the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to take land into trust violates a federal statute\u201d). The\nrelief requested was also identical to that sought here: injunctive\nrelief directing the United States to \u201c\u00a0\u2018cease and desist from\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. exercising privileges of ownership\u2019\u00a0\u201d over the\nland in question. 461 U.\u00a0S., at 278; see also App. 38.The only difference that the majority can point\nto betweenBlockand this case is that Patchak asserts a\nweaker interest in the disputed property. But that is no reason to\nimagine that Congress intended a different outcome. As the majority\nitself acknowledges, the harm to the United States and tribes when\na plaintiff sues to extinguish the Government\u2019s title to Indian\ntrust land is identical \u201cwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own\nthe land himself.\u201dAnte,at 12. Yet, if the majority is\ncorrect, Congress intended the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity to apply to\nthose hypothetical plaintiffs differently. Congress, it suggests,\nintended to permit anyone to circumvent the QTA\u2019s careful\nlimitations and sue to force the Government to relinquish Indian\ntrust lands\u2014anyone, that is, except those with the strongest\nentitlement to bring such actions: those claiming a personal\n\u201cright, title, or interest\u201d in the land in question. The majority\u2019s\nconclusion hinges, therefore, on the doubtful premise that Congress\nintended to waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity wholesale for\nthose like Patchak, who assert an \u201caesthetic\u201d interest in land,ante,at 1, while retaining the Government\u2019s sovereign immu-\nnity against those who assert a constitutional interest in land\u2014the\ndeprivation of property without due process of law. This is highly\nimplausible. Unsurprisingly, the majority does not even attempt to\nexplain why Congress would have intended this counterintuitive\nresult.It is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no\nfurther than an \u201cordinary quiet title suit.\u201dAnte,at 11.\nThe action permitted by \u00a72409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit.\nAt common law, equity courts \u201cpermit[ted] a bill to quiet title to\nbe filed only by a party inpossession[of land] against a\ndefendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to establish a\nlegal title by repeated actions of ejectment.\u201dWehrmanv.Conklin,155 U.S.\n314, 321\u2013322 (1894) (emphasis added). Section 2409a is broader,\nrequiring neither prerequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us,\nseeante,at 7, an act to quiet title is \u201cuniversally\nunderstood\u201d as a proceeding \u201cto establish a plaintiff\u2019stitleto land.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009)\n(emphasis added). But \u00a72409a authorizes civil actions in cases in\nwhich neither the Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to\nthe land at issue. See \u00a72409a(d) (\u201cThe complaint shall set forth\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. theright, title, orinterestwhich\nthe plaintiff claims\u201d (emphasis added)).[4] A plaintiff may file suit under \u00a72409a, for\ninstance, when he claims only an easement in land, the right to\nexplore an area for minerals, or some other lesser right or\ninterest. See S.\u00a0Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 5. Notwithstanding its\ncolloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly allows suit in\ncircumstances well beyond \u201cbread-and-butter quiet title actions,\u201dante,at 3, n.\u00a03.[5]The majority attempts to bolster its reading by\nemphasizing an unexpected source within \u00a72409a: the clause\nspecifying that the United States may be sued \u201c\u00a0\u2018ina civil\naction under this section.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 11. The\nmajority understands this clause to narrow the QTA\u2019s scope (and its\nlimitations on the Government\u2019s immunity waiver) to quiet title\nclaims only. But \u201cthis section\u201d speaks broadly to civil actions \u201cto\nadjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.\u201d \u00a72409a. Moreover, this clause is read\nmost straightforwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose:\nsimply to state that a claimant can file \u201ca civil action under this\nsection\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014to adjudicate a disputed title in which the United\nStates claims an interest. Regardless of how one reads the clause,\nhowever, it does not alter the APA\u2019s clear command that suits\nseeking relief forbidden by other statutes are not authorized by\nthe APA. And the QTA forbids the relief sought here: injunctive\nrelief forcing the Government to relinquish title to Indian\nlands.Even if the majority were correct that the QTA\nitself reached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that\nwould establish only that the QTA does not expressly forbid the\nrelief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does not waive the\nGovernment\u2019s sovereign immunity where any other statute \u201cexpresslyor impliedlyforbids the relief which is sought.\u201d 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702 (emphasis added). The text and history of\nthe QTA, as well as this Court\u2019s precedent, make clear that the\nUnited States intended to retain its sovereign immunity from suits\nto dispossess the Government of Indian trust land. Patchak\u2019s suit\nto oust the Government of such land is therefore, at minimum,\nimpliedly forbidden.[6]IIThree consequences illustrate the difficulties\ntoday\u2019s holding will present for courts and the Government. First,\nit will render the QTA\u2019s limitations easily circumvented. Although\nthose with property claims will remain formally prohibited from\nbringing APA suits because ofBlock, savvy plaintiffs and\ntheir lawyers can recruit a family member or neighbor to bring suit\nasserting only an \u201caesthetic\u201d interest in the land but seeking an\nidentical prac- tical objective\u2014to divest the Government of title\nand possession. \u00a7\u00a72409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from\nobtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.Second, the majority\u2019s holding will frustrate\nthe Government\u2019s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust\ndecisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak asserts an\n\u201caesthetic\u201d or \u201cenvironmental\u201d concern with a planned use of Indian\ntrust land, he may bring a distinct suit under statutes like the\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act. Those challenges generally may be brought within\nthe APA\u2019s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations. Suits to contest\nthe Government\u2019s decision to take title to land in trust for Indian\ntribes, however, have been governed by a different rule. Until\ntoday, parties seeking to challenge such decisions had only a\n30-day window to seek judi- cial review. 25 CFR \u00a7151.12 (2011); 61\nFed. Reg. 18,082\u201318,083 (1996). That deadline promoted finality and\nsecurity\u2014necessary preconditions for the investment and \u201ceconomic\ndevelopment\u201d that are central goals of the Indian Reorganization\nAct.Ante,at 16.[7]\nToday\u2019s result will promote the opposite, retarding tribes\u2019 ability\nto develop land until the APA\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations has\nlapsed.[8]Finally, the majority\u2019s rule creates substantial\nuncertainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA\nclaims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether its rule\nbars from suit only those who \u201cclaim any competing interest\u201d in the\ndisputed land in their complaint,ante,at 7, or those who\ncould claim a competing interest, but plead only that the\nGovernment\u2019s title claim violates a federal statute. If the former,\nthe majority\u2019s holding would allow Patchak\u2019s challenge to go\nforward even if he had some personal interest in the Bradley\nProperty, so long as his complaint did not assert it. That result\nis difficult to square withBlockandMottaz. If the\nlatter, matters are even more peculiar. Because a shrewd plaintiff\nwill avoid referencing her own property claim in her complaint, the\nGovernment may assert sovereign immu- nity only if its detective\nefforts uncover the plaintiff\u2019s unstated property claim. Not only\ndoes that impose a substantial burden on the Government, but it\ncreates per-verse incentives for private litigants. What if a\nplain- tiff has a weak claim, or a claim that she does not know\nabout? Did Congress really intend for the availability of APA\nrelief to turn on whether a plaintiff does a better job of\noverlooking or suppressing her own property interest than the\nGovernment does of sleuthing it out?As these observations illustrate, the majority\u2019s\nrule will impose a substantial burden on the Government and leave\nan array of uncertainties. Moreover, it will open to suit lands\nthat Congress and the Executive Branch thought the \u201cnational public\ninterest\u201d demanded should remain immune from challenge. Congress\ndid not intend either result.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that\nthe QTA bars the relief Patchak seeks. I respectfully dissent.Notes1As we explained inBlockv.North Dakota ex\u00a0rel. Board of Univ. and\nSchool Lands,461 U.S.\n273, 282\u2013283 (1983), Congress\u2019 initial proposal lacked such\nprovisions. The Executive Branch, however, strongly opposed the\noriginal bill, explaining that it was \u201ctoo broad and sweeping in\nscope and lacking adequate safeguards to protect the public\ninterest.\u201d Dispute of Titles on Public Lands: Hearings on S. 216\net\u00a0al. before the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate\nCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 21\n(1971). Congress ultimately agreed, largely adopting the\nExecutive\u2019s substitute bill. SeeBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at\n283\u2013284.2The majority claims,ante,at 7, n.\u00a03, that this test has \u201cno obvious\nlimits,\u201d but it merely applies the text of \u00a7702 (which speaks of\n\u201crelief,\u201d not \u201cgrievances\u201d). In any event, the majority\u2019s\nhypothetical,ibid., compares apples to oranges. I do not\ncontend that the APA bars all injunctive relief involving Indian\nlands, simply other suits\u2014like this one\u2014that seek \u201cto adjudicate a\ndisputed title to real property in which the United States claims\nan interest.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72409a(a). That result is\nentirely consistent withBlock\u2014which stated that the APA\n\u201cspecifically confers no \u2018authority to grant relief if any other\nstatute .\u00a0.\u00a0. expressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 461 U.\u00a0S, at 286, n. 22 (quoting 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7702).3An officer\u2019s suit is an\naction directly against a federal officer, but was otherwise\nidentical to the kind of APA action at issue here. CompareBlock, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 281 (seeking relief because agency\nofficial\u2019s actions were \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cnot within [his] statutory\npowers\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d), with 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706(2)(C) (\u201cThe\nreviewing court shall .\u00a0.\u00a0. hold unlawful and set aside\nagency action .\u00a0.\u00a0. found to be .\u00a0.\u00a0. in excess\nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\nlimitations\u201d).4The majority notes that\nsome States permit a broader class ofclaims under the rubric of\n\u201cquiet title,\u201d and points to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018wide differences in State\nstatutory and decisional law\u2019 on quiet title suits\u201d at the time of\nthe Act.Ante,at 8, n.\u00a04. But that substantial\nvariation only illustrates the artificiality of the majority\u2019s\nclaim that the Act only \u201caddresses quiet title actions, asordinarilyconceived.\u201dAnte,at 9,\nn.\u00a05.5I recognize, of course,\nthat the QTA is titled \u201c[a]n Act to permit suits to adjudicate\ncertain real property quiet title actions.\u201d 86Stat. 1176. But \u201cthe\ntitle of a statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot limit the plain meaning\nof [its] text.\u201dTrainmenv.Baltimore & Ohio\nR.\u00a0Co.,331 U.S.\n519, 528\u2013529 (1947). As explained above, the substance of\nCongress\u2019 enactment plainly extends more broadly than quiet title\nactions, mirroring the scope of the title proposed by the\nGovernment. Seesupra,at 2.6Because I conclude that\nsovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit,I would not reach the\nquestion of whether he has standing.7Trust status, for\ninstance, is a prerequisite to making lands eligible for various\nfederal incentives and tax credits closely tied to economic\ndevelopment. See,e.g.,App. 56. Delayed suits will also\ninhibit tribes from investing in uses other than gaming that might\nbe less objection-able\u2014like farming or office use.8Despite notice of the\nGovernment\u2019s intent through an organization with which he was\naffiliated, Patchak did not challenge the Government\u2019s fee-to-trust\ndecision even though the organization did. SeeMichigan Gambling\nOppositionv.Kempthorne, 525 F.3d 23 (CADC 2008).\nInstead, Patchak waited to sue until three years after the\nSecretary\u2019s intent to acquire the property was published. App. 35,\n39.",
