S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-1533FRANTZ DePIERRE, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit[June 9, 2011]Justice Sotomayor delivered the\nopinion of the Court.At the time of petitioner\u2019s\nconviction and sentence, federal law mandated a minimum 10-year\nsentence for persons convicted of certain drug offenses, 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7841(a), including those involving 50 grams or more of\n\u201ca mixture or substance \u2026 which contains cocaine base,\u201d\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and a minimum 5-year sentence for offenses\ninvolving 5 grams or more of the same, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii). This\ncase requires us to decide whether the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used\nin this statute refers generally to cocaine in its chemically basic\nform or exclusively to what is colloquially known as \u201ccrack\ncocaine.\u201d We conclude that \u201ccocaine base\u201d means the former.IAAs a matter of chemistry, cocaine\nis an alkaloid with the molecular formula C17H21NO4. Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 434 (2002). An alkaloid is a base\u2014that\nis, a compound capable of reacting with an acid to form a\nsalt.[Footnote 1]Id.,\nat 54, 180; see also Brief for Individual Physicians and Scientists\nasAmici Curiae2\u20133 (herein-after Physicians Brief).\nCocaine is derived from the coca plant native to South America. The\nleaves of the coca plant can be processed with water, kerosene,\nsodium car-bonate, and sulphuric acid to produce a paste-like\nsubstance. R. Weiss, S. Mirin, & R. Bartel, Cocaine 10 (2d ed.\n1994). When dried, the resulting \u201ccoca paste\u201d can be vaporized\n(through the application of heat) and inhaled,i.e.,\n\u201csmoked.\u201d See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report\nto the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 11\u201312 (1995)\n(hereinafter Commission Report). Coca paste contains C17H21NO4\u2014that is, cocaine in\nits base form.Dissolving coca paste in water and\nhydrochloric acid produces (after several intermediate steps)\ncocaine hydrochloride, which is a salt with the molecular formula\nC17H22NO4+Cl-.Id., at 12;\nPhysicians Brief 3. Cocaine hydrochloride, therefore, is not a\nbase. It generally comes in powder form, which we will refer to as\n\u201cpowder cocaine.\u201d It is usually insufflated (breathed in through\nthe nose), though it can also be ingested or diluted in water and\ninjected. Because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a much higher\ntemperature than chemically basic cocaine (at which point the\ncocaine molecule tends to decompose), it is generally not smoked.\nSee Commission Report 11, n.\u00a015,\n12\u201313.Cocaine hydrochloride can be converted into\ncocaine in its base form by combining powder cocaine with water and\na base, like sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda).Id., at 14. The chemical reaction changes the cocaine\nhydrochloride molecule into a chemically basic cocaine molecule,\nPhysicians Brief 4, and the resulting solid substance can be cooled\nand broken into small pieces and then smoked, Commission Report 14.\nThis substance is commonly known as \u201ccrack\u201d or \u201ccrack\ncocaine.\u201d[Footnote 2]\nAlternatively, powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and ammonia\n(also a base); with the addition of ether, a solid substance\u2014known\nas \u201cfreebase\u201d\u2014separates from the solu-tion, and can be smoked.Id., at 13. As with crack cocaine, freebase contains\ncocaine in its chemically basic form.Ibid.Chemically, therefore, there is no difference\nbetween the cocaine in coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase\u2014all\nare cocaine in its base form. On the other hand, cocaine in its\nbase form and in its salt form (i.e., cocaine\nhydrochloride) are chemically different, though they have the same\nactive ingredient and produce the same physiological and\npsychotropic effects. Seeid., at 14\u201322. The key\ndifference between them is the method by which they generally enter\nthe body; smoking cocaine in its base form\u2014whether as coca paste,\nfreebase, or crack cocaine\u2014allows the body to absorb the active\ningredient quickly, thereby producing a shorter, more intense high\nthan obtained from insufflating cocaine hydrochloride.Ibid.; see generallyKimbroughv.United\nStates,552 U. S. 85, 94\n(2007).BIn 1986,\nincreasing public concern over the dangers associated with illicit\ndrugs\u2014and the new phenomenon of crack cocaine in\nparticular\u2014prompted Congress to re-vise the penalties for criminal\noffenses involving cocaine-related substances. Seeid., at\n95\u201396. At the time, federal law generally tied the penalties for\ndrug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity involved,\nwith no pro-vision for mandatory minimum sentences. See,e.g., \u00a7841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III). After holding\nseveral hearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack\ncocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA),\n100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory minimum sentences for\ncontrolled-substance offenses in-volving specific quantities of\ndrugs.As relevant\nhere, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10-year sentence for certain\ndrug offenses involving 5 kilograms or more of \u201ca mixture or\nsubstance containing a detectable amount of\u00a0\u201d various\ncocaine-related elements, including coca leaves, cocaine, and\ncocaine salts; it also called for the same sentence for offenses\ninvolving only 50 grams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance \u2026which contains cocaine base.\u201d ADAA, \u00a71002, 100 Stat.\n3207\u20132 (amending \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2013(iii)) (emphasis added). The\nADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for offenses\ninvolving 500 grams of a mixture or substance containing coca\nleaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5 grams of a mixture or\nsubstance containing \u201ccocaine base.\u201dId., at 3207\u20133\n(amending\n\u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(ii)\u2013(iii)).Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio\nfor the threshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that\ntriggered the statute\u2019s mandatory minimum penalties. That is, 5\ngrams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance \u2026 which contains cocaine\nbase\u201d was penalized as severely as 100 times that amount of the\nother cocaine-related elements enumerated in the statute. These\nprovisions were still in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s\nconviction and sentence.[Footnote\n3] See \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B) (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV).The United States Sentencing Commission\nsubsequently promulgated Sentencing Guidelines for drug-trafficking\noffenses. Under the Guidelines, the offense levels for drug crimes\nare tied to the drug type and quantity involved. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2010)\n(USSG). The Commission originally adopted the ADAA\u2019s 100-to-1 ratio\nfor offenses involving \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base,\u201d though instead\nof setting only two quantity thresholds, as the ADAA did, the\nGuidelines \u201cset sentences for the full range of possible drug\nquantities.\u201d Commission Report 1; see generallyKimbrough,\n552 U. S., at 96\u201397.[Footnote\n4]The original version of \u00a72D1.1(c) did not\ndefine \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in that provision, but in 1993 the\nCommission issued an amendment to explain that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[c]ocaine\nbase,\u2019 for the purposes of this guideline, means \u2018crack,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthat is, \u201cthe street name for a form of cocaine base, usually\nprepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium\nbicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\u201d USSG\nApp. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov. 1, 1993); see also USSG\n\u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D). The Commission noted that \u201cforms of cocaine base\nother than crack (e.g., coca paste \u2026) will be treated as\ncocaine.\u201d USSG App. C, Amdt. 487.[Footnote\n5]CIn April\n2005, petitioner Frantz DePierre sold two bags of drugs to a\nGovernment informant. DePierre was subsequently indicted on a\ncharge of distributing 50 grams or more of cocaine base under\n\u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).[Footnote 6] At trial, a Government chemist testified that\nthe substance in the bags, which weighed 55.1 grams, was \u201ccocaine\nbase.\u201d Tr. 488, 490. She was not able to identify any sodium\nbicarbonate.Id., at 499. A police officer testified that\nthe substance in question was \u201coff-white [and] chunky.\u201dId., at\n455.DePierre\nasked the District Court to instruct the jury that, in order to\nfind him guilty of distribution of cocaine base, it must find that\nhis offense involved \u201cthe form of cocaine base known as crack\ncocaine.\u201d App. in No. 08\u20132101 (CA1), p. 43. His proposed jury\ninstruction defined \u201ccrack\u201d identically to the Guidelines\ndefinition. Seeid., at 43\u201344; see also USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n.\n(D). In addition, De-Pierre asked the court to instruct the jury\nthat \u201c[c]hemi-cal analysis cannot establish a substance as crack\nbecause crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine\nbase, although it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,\nwhich is usually used in the processing of crack.\u201d App. in No.\n08\u20132101, at\n44.The court, however, instructed the jury that\n\u201cthe statute that\u2019s relevant asks about cocaine base. Crack cocaine\nis a form of cocaine base, so you\u2019ll tell us whether or not what\nwas involved is cocaine base \u2026\u00a0.\u201d Tr. 585 (paragraph break\nomitted). The jury form asked whether the offense involved \u201cover 50\ngrams of cocaine base.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. The jury found\nDePierre guilty of distributing 50 grams or more of cocaine base,\nand the court sentenced DePierre to 120 months in prison as\nrequired by the\nstatute.The United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Cir-cuit affirmed, rejecting DePierre\u2019s argument that\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should be read only to apply to offenses\ninvolving crack cocaine. 599 F.\u00a03d 25, 30\u201331 (2010). While\nnoting the division on this question among the Courts of Appeals,id., at 30\u201331, and nn.\u00a03, 4, the First Circuit\nadhered to its own precedent and \u201cread the statute according to its\nterms,\u201d holding that \u201c\u00a0\u2018cocaine base\u2019 refers to \u2018all forms of\ncocaine base, including but not limited to crack cocaine.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 30\u201331 (quotingUnited Statesv.Anderson, 452 F.\u00a03d 66, 86\u201387 (CA1 2006)). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the longstanding division in authority among\nthe Courts of Appeals on this question. 562 U. S. ___\n(2010).IIAWe begin\nwith the statutory text. SeeUnited Statesv.Ron Pair\nEnterprises, Inc.,489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989). Section 841(b)(1)(A) provides a mandatory 10-year minimum\nsentence for certain drug offenses\ninvolving\u201c(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a\nmixture or substance containing a detectable amount\nof\u2014\u201c(I) coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca\nleaves from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine or\ntheir salts have been\nremoved;\u201c(II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and\nsalts of\nisomers;\u201c(III) ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and\nsalts of isomers;\nor\u201c(IV) any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any\nquantity of any of the substances referred to in subclauses (I)\nthrough (III);\n[or]\u201c(iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in\nclause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d[Footnote\n7]We agree\nwith the Government that the most natural reading of the term\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d is \u201ccocaine in its base form\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nC17H21NO4, the\nmolecule found in crack cocaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its\nplain terms, then, \u201ccocaine base\u201d reaches more broadly than just\ncrack cocaine. In arguing to the contrary, DePierre asks us to\nstray far from the statute\u2019s text, as the term \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d\nappears nowhere in the ADAA (or the United States Code, for that\nmatter). While the Government\u2019s reading is not without its\nproblems,[Footnote 8] that\nreading follows from the words Congress chose to include in the\ntext. SeeUnited Statesv.Rodriquez,553 U. S. 377, 384\n(2008) (eschewing an interpretation that was \u201cnot faithful to the\nstatutory text\u201d). In short, the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d is more\nplausibly read to mean the \u201cchemically basic form of cocaine,\u201d\nBrief for United States 15, than it is \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 24, 28.[Footnote\n9]We agree with DePierre that using the term\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d to refer to C17H21NO4 is technically redundant; as noted\nearlier, chemically speaking cocaineisa base. If\nCongress meant in clause (iii) to penalize more severely offenses\ninvolving \u201ca mixture or substance \u2026 which contains\u201d cocaine in its\nbase form it could have simply (and more correctly) used the word\n\u201ccocaine\u201d instead. But Congress had good reason to use \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d in the ADAA\u2014to distinguish the substances covered by clause\n(iii) from other cocaine-related substances. For example, at the\ntime Congress enacted the statute, the word \u201ccocaine\u201d was commonly\nused to refer to cocaine hydrochloride,i.e., powder\ncocaine. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Mon-toya\nde Hernandez,473 U. S. 531, 536, 544\n(1985) (repeatedly referring to cocaine hydrochloride as\n\u201ccocaine\u201d); \u201cCrack\u201d Cocaine, Hearing before the Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on\nGovernmental Affairs, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 94 (1986) (hereinafter\nCrack Cocaine Hearing) (prepared statement of David L. Westrate,\nAssistant Administrator, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice)\n(discussing production of \u201ca white, crystalline powder, cocaine\nhydrochloride, otherwise known simply as\ncocaine\u201d).To make\nthings more confusing, in the scientific and medical literature the\nword \u201ccocaine\u201d is often used to refer toallcocaine-related substances, including powder cocaine. See,e.g., J. Fay, The Alcohol/Drug Abuse Dictionary and\nEncyclopedia 26\u201327 (1988); Weiss et\u00a0al., Cocaine, at 15\u201325; R.\nLewis, Hawley\u2019s Condensed Chemical Dictionary 317 (15th ed. 2007).\nAccordingly, Congress\u2019 choice to use the admittedly redundant term\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d to refer to chemically basic cocaine is best\nunderstood as an effort to make clear that clause (iii) does not\napply to offenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic\ncocaine-related\nsubstances.BNotwithstanding DePierre\u2019s\narguments to the contrary, reading \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean\nchemically basic cocaine is also consistent with \u00a7841(b)(1)\u2019s\nsomewhat confounding structure. DePierre is correct that the\ninterpretation we adopt today raises the question why Congress\nincluded the word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) of clause (ii). That\nsubclause lists \u201ccocaine, its salts, optical and geometric\nisomers, and salts of isomers\u201d as elements subject to clause (ii)\u2019s\nhigher quantity threshold. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II), (B)(ii)(II)\n(emphasis added). If, as we conclude, the terms \u201ccocaine\u201d and\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d both mean chemically basic cocaine, offenses\ninvolving a mixture or substance which contains such cocaine will\nalways be penalized according to the lower quantity thresholds of\nclause (iii), and never the higher quantity thresholds clause (ii)\nestablishes for mixtures and substances containing\n\u201ccocaine.\u201d[Footnote\n10]While this much is true, we\ndo not agree with DePierre that the word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause\n(II) is therefore superfluous. For without the word \u201ccocaine\u201d\nsubclause (II) makes no sense: It would provide a minimum sentence\nfor offenses involving a specified quantity of simply \u201cits salts,\noptical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\u201d In light of\nthe structure of the subclause, the word \u201ccocaine\u201d is needed as the\nreference point for \u201csalts\u201d and\n\u201cisomers.\u201dThe word\n\u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) also performs another critical\nfunction. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving \u201ca mixture or\nsubstancedescribed in clause (ii)which contains cocaine\nbase.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii) (emphasis added). In other\nwords, clause (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving\ncocaine-related substances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a\nhigher penalty for a subset of those substances\u2014the ones that\n\u201ccontai[n] cocaine base.\u201d For this structure to work, however,\n\u00a7841(b)(1) must \u201cdescrib[e] in clause (ii)\u201d substances containing\nchemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the subset described\nin clause (iii). If such substances were not present in clause\n(ii), clause (iii) would only apply to substances that contain both\nchemically basic cocaine and one of theotherelements\nenumerated in clause (ii). Presumably, the result would be that\nclause (iii) would not apply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca\npaste offenses, as there is no indication that, in addition to\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d (i.e., C17H21NO4), those substances contain cocaine\n\u201csalts\u201d (e.g., cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of\nthe other elements enumerated in clause (ii). In short, the\nexclusion of \u201ccocaine\u201d from clause (ii) would result in clause\n(iii) effectively describing a null set, which obviously was not\nCongress\u2019\nintent.Of course,\nthis redundancy could have been avoided by simply drafting clause\n(iii) to penalize offenses involving \u201ca mixture or substance which\ncontains cocaine base,\u201d without reference to clause (ii)\u2014that is,\nCongress could have drafted clause (iii) to specify aseparateset of cocaine-related substances, not asubsetof those in clause (ii). That we may rue inartful\nlegislative drafting, however, does not excuse us from the\nresponsibility of construing a statute as faithfully as possible to\nits actual text.[Footnote\n11] And as noted earlier, there is no textual support for\nDePierre\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack\ncocaine.\u201dWe also\nrecognize that our reading of \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) and\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) to both refer to chemically basic\ncocaine is in tension with the usual rule that \u201cwhen the\nlegislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and\ndifferent language in another, the court assumes different meanings\nwere intended.\u201dSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542 U. S. 692, 711,\nn.\u00a09 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). However,\nbecause \u201cCongress sometimes uses slightly different language to\nconvey the same message,\u201dDealv.United States,508 U. S. 129,\n134 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), we must be careful\nnot to place too much emphasis on the marginal semantic divergence\nbetween the terms \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base.\u201d As we have already\nexplained, Congress had good reason to employ the latter term in\nclause (iii), and the slight inconsistency in nomenclature is\ninsufficient reason to adopt DePierre\u2019s interpretation. Cf.Public Lands Councilv.Babbitt,529 U. S. 728, 746\u2013747\n(2000) (suggesting that a \u201cstatute\u2019s basic purpose\u201d might support\nthe conclusion that \u201ctwo sets of different words mean the same\nthing\u201d).IIIDePierre offers four\nadditional arguments in support of his view that the term \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d in clause (iii) is best read to mean \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d We do\nnot find them\nconvincing.ADePierre first argues that\nwe should read \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d because, in\npassing the ADAA, Congress in 1986 intended to penalize crack\ncocaine offenses more severely than those involving other\nsubstances containing C17H21NO4. As is evident from the pre-ceding\ndiscussion, this position is not supported by the statutory text.\nTo be sure, the records of the contemporaneous congressional\nhearings suggest that Congress was most concerned with the\nparticular dangers posed by the advent of crack cocaine. See,e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 1 (statement of Chairman Roth)\n(\u201c[We] mee[t] today to examine a frightening and dangerous new\ntwist in the drug abuse problem\u2014the growing availability and use of\na cheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known on the\nstreets as \u2018crack\u2019\u00a0\u201d); see generally Commission Report\n116\u2013118;Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at\n95\u201396.It does not necessarily\nfollow, however, that in passing the ADAA Congress meant for clause\n(iii)\u2019s lower quantity thresholds to applyexclusivelyto\ncrack cocaine offenses. Numerous witnesses at the hearings\ntestified that the primary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous\nwas because\u2014contrary to powder cocaine\u2014cocaine in its base form is\nsmoked, which was understood to produce a faster, more intense, and\nmore addictive high than powder cocaine. See,e.g., Crack\nCocaine Hearing 20 (statement of Dr. Robert Byck, Yale University\nSchool of Medicine) (stating that the ability to inhale vapor \u201cis\nthe reason why crack, or cocaine free-base, is so dangerous\u201d). This\nis not, however, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase\nand coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous, smokeable forms\nof cocaine. See,e.g.,id., at 70 (prepared\nstatement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National Institute\non Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from snorting powder cocaine\nto \u201cnewer more dangerous routes of administration, such as freebase\nsmoking\u201d);id., at 19\u201320 (statement of Dr. Byck)\n(describing the damaging effects of cocaine smoking on people in\nPeru).Moreover,\nthe testimony of witnesses before Congress did not clearly\ndistinguish between these base forms of cocaine; witnesses\nrepeatedly used terms like \u201ccocaine base,\u201d \u201cfreebase,\u201d or \u201ccocaine\nfreebase\u201d in a manner that grouped crack cocaine with other\nsubstances containing chemically basic forms of cocaine. See,e.g., Trafficking and Abuse of \u201cCrack\u201d in New York City,\nHouse Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong.,\n2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M. Stutman, Special Agent\nin Charge, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice) (\u201c[C]ocaine\nin its alkaloid form [is] commonly known on the street as crack,\nrock, base, or freebase\u201d); Crack Cocaine Hearing 71 (statement of\nDr. Schuster) (\u201cIn other words, \u2018crack\u2019 is a street name for\ncocaine freebase\u201d). In fact, prior to passage of the ADAA, multiple\nbills were introduced in Congress that imposed enhanced penalties\non those who trafficked in \u201ccocaine base,\u201de.g.,S. 2787,\n99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a71 (1986), as well as \u201ccocaine freebase,\u201de.g.,H.\u00a0R. 5394, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7101 (1986);\nH.\u00a0R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7608(a)\n(1986).Given\ncrack cocaine\u2019s sudden emergence and the similarities it shared\nwith other forms of cocaine, this lack of clarity is\nunderstandable, as is Congress\u2019 desire to adopt a statutory term\nthat would encompass all forms. Congress faced what it perceived to\nbe a new threat of massive scope. See,e.g., Crack Cocaine\nHearing 4 (statement of Sen. Nunn) (\u201c[C]ocaine use, particularly in\nthe more pure form known as crack, is at near epidemic\nproportions\u201d);id., at 21 (statement of Dr. Byck) (\u201cWe are\ndealing with a worse drug \u2026 than we have ever dealt with, or that\nanybody has ever dealt with in history\u201d). Accordingly, Con-gress\nchose statutory language broad enough to meet that threat. As we\nhave noted, \u201cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal\nevil to cover reasonably comparable evils.\u201dOncalev.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998).\nIn the absence of any indication in the statutory text that\nCongress intended only to subject crack cocaine offenses to\nenhanced penalties, we cannot adopt DePierre\u2019s narrow construction.\nSeeLewisv.Chicago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 9) (\u201cIt is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that\nit covers only what we think is necessary to achieve what we think\nCongress really\nintended\u201d).BDePierre also argues that\nwe should read the term \u201cco-caine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d\nrather than chemically basic cocaine, because the latter definition\nleads to an absurd result. Cf.EEOCv.Commercial\nOffice Products Co.,486 U. S. 107, 120\n(1988) (plurality opinion). He contends that, because coca leaves\nthemselves contain cocaine, under the Government\u2019s approach an\noffense involving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the\n5-year minimum sentence in \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though those\nleaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable cocaine. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 41\u201342. While we agree that it would be questionable\nto treat 5 grams of coca leaves as equivalent to 500 grams of\npowder cocaine for minimum-sentence purposes, we are not persuaded\nthat such a result would actually obtain in light of our decision\ntoday.To begin with, it is a\nmatter of dispute between the parties whether coca leaves in their\nnatural, unprocessed form actually contain chemically basic\ncocaine. Compare Brief for Petitioner 15, 17, n.\u00a010, with\nBrief for United States 43. Even assuming that DePierre is correct\nas a matter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its\nbase form,[Footnote 12] see\nPhysicians Brief 2, 11, the Government has averred that it \u201cwould\nnot be able to make that showing in court,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27,\nand that \u201ccoca leaves should not be treated as containing \u2018cocaine\nbase\u2019 for purposes of Clause (iii),\u201d Brief for United States\n45.It is\nunsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its brief\ndisclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which it had sought, or\nthe defendant had received, a statutory-minimum sentence enhanced\nunder clause (iii) for an of-fense involving coca leaves.Id., at 44. And although this question is not before us\ntoday, we note that Congress\u2019 deliberate choice to enumerate \u201ccoca\nleaves\u201d in clause (ii) strongly indicates its intent that offenses\ninvolving such leaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds\nof that clause. Accordingly, there is little danger that the\nstatute will be read in the \u201cabsurd\u201d manner DePierre\nfears.CIn addition, DePierre\nsuggests that because the Sentencing Commission has, since 1993,\ndefined \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack\u201d for the purposes of the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with respect\nto \u00a7841(b)(1). We do not agree. We have never held that, when\ninterpreting a term in a criminal statute, deference is warranted\nto the Sentencing Commission\u2019s definition of the same term in the\nGuidelines. Cf.Nealv.United States,516 U. S. 284, 290\u2013296\n(1996). And we need not decide now whether such deference would be\nappropriate, because the Guidelines do not purport to interpret\n\u00a7841(b)(1). See USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Cocaine base,\u2019for the purposes of this guideline, means \u2018crack\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(emphasis added)).[Footnote\n13]We recognize that, because\nthe definition of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) differs from the\nGuidelines definition, certain sentencing anomalies may result. For\nexample, an offense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine and one\ninvolving 5 grams of coca paste both trigger a minimum 5- year\nsentence under \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii). But defendants convicted of\noffenses involving only 4 grams of each substance\u2014which do not\ntrigger the statutory minimums\u2014would likely receive different\nsentences, because of the Guidelines\u2019 differential treatment of\nthose substances with respect to offense level.[Footnote 14] Compare USSG \u00a72D1.1(c)(9)\n(providing an offense level of 22 for at least 4 grams of \u201ccocaine\nbase,\u201di.e., \u201ccrack\u201d) with \u00a72D1.1(c)(14) (providing an\noffense level of 12 for less than 25 grams of \u201ccocaine,\u201d which,\nunder the Guidelines, includes coca paste). As we have noted in\nprevious opinions, however, such disparities are the inevitable\nresult of the dissimilar operation of the fixed minimum sentences\nCongress has provided by\nstat-ute and the graduated\nsentencing scheme established by the Guidelines. SeeKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107\u2013108;Neal, 516 U.\nS., at 291\u2013292. Accordingly, we reject De-Pierre\u2019s suggestion that\nthe term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in clause (iii) must be given the\nsame definition as it has under the\nGuidelines.DFinally, DePierre argues\nthat, because \u00a7841(b)(1) is at the very least ambiguous, the rule\nof lenity requires us to interpret the statute in his favor. SeeUnited Statesv.Santos,553 U. S. 507, 514\n(2008) (\u201cThe rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be\ninterpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them\u201d). As\nevinced by the preceding discussion, we cannot say that the statute\nis crystalline. The rule, however, is reserved for cases where,\n\u201cafter seizing everything from which aid can be derived, the Court\nis left with an ambiguous statute.\u201dSmithv.United\nStates,508 U.\nS. 223, 239 (1993) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Applying the normal rules of statutory construction in\nthis case, it is clear that Congress used the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d\nin clause (iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses\ninvolving \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but those involving substances\ncontaining chemically basic cocaine more generally. There is no\nper-suasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.\nBecause the statutory text allows us to make far more than \u201ca guess\nas to what Congress intended,\u201dRenov.Koray,515 U. S. 50, 65\n(1995) (internal quotation marks omitted), the rule of lenity does\nnot apply in DePierre\u2019s\nfavor.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that the term\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in \u00a7841(b)(1) means not just \u201ccrack\ncocaine,\u201d but cocaine in its chemically basic form. We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.It is so\nordered.Footnote\n1There are more detailed theories of how\nacids and bases interact. For our purposes, it is sufficient to\nnote the fundamental proposition that a base and an acid can\ncombine to form a salt, and all three are different types of\ncompounds. See generally Brief for Individual Physicians and\nScientists asAmici Curiae8; A Dictionary of Chemistry\n6\u20137, 62\u201363, 496 (J. Dainith ed., 5th ed.\n2004).Footnote\n2Though the terms \u201ccrack\u201d and \u201ccrack\ncocaine\u201d are interchangeable, in this opinion we adopt DePierre\u2019s\npractice and generally employ the\nlatter.Footnote\n3Due to a recent amendment, the quantity\nratio in \u00a7841(b)(1) is now roughly 18-to-1, but otherwise the\nrelevant statutory provisions are unchanged from those in effect at\nthe time DePierre was sentenced. See Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\n(FSA), \u00a72, 124 Stat. 2372 (changing the quantity in\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) from 50 to 280 grams and in subparagraph\n(B)(iii) from 5 to 28\ngrams).Footnote\n4In 2007 the Commission increased the\nquantity of cocaine base required to trigger each offense level,\nreducing the cocaine base-to-cocaine sentencing ratio under the\nGuidelines. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov. 1,\n2007). Unless otherwise noted, we cite to the current versions of\nthe relevant Guidelines\nprovisions.Footnote\n5The Guidelines\u2019 Drug Quantity Table\nonly lists \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d among its enumerated\ncontrolled substances, but the application notes make clear that\nthe term \u201ccocaine\u201d includes \u201cecgonine and coca leaves,\u201d as well as\n\u201csalts, isomers, and salts of isomers\u201d of cocaine. \u00a72D1.1(c), and\ncomment.,\nn.\u00a05.Footnote\n6DePierre was also indicted for\ndistribution of powder cocaine under \u00a7841(a)(1) and possession of a\nfirearm with an obliterated serial number under 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(k). He was convicted by jury of the former offense and pleaded\nguilty to the latter prior to\ntrial.Footnote\n7As noted earlier, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B) calls\nfor a mandatory minimum 5-year sentence for offenses involving\nexactly the same substances; the only difference in subparagraph\n(B) is that the threshold quantity in clause (ii) is 500 grams, and\nin clause (iii) it is 5 grams. Because the 100-to-1 ratio is a\nfeature of both \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A) and (B), and those subparagraphs are\nidentical in all other respects, throughout this opinion we use the\nterms \u201cclause (ii)\u201d and \u201cclause (iii)\u201d to refer to those clauses as\npresent in either\nsubparagraph.Footnote\n8The Government urges us to give\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d its \u201csettled, unambiguous scientific meaning,\u201di.e., \u201cthe form of cocaine classified chemically as a\nbase, with the chemical formula C17H21NO4 and a particular molecular structure.\u201d\nBrief for United States 20; cf.McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc.v.Wilander,498 U. S. 337, 342\n(1991) (\u201cIn the absence of contrary indication, we assume that when\na statute uses \u2026 a term [of art], Congress intended it to have its\nestablished meaning\u201d). But the scientifically proper appellation\nfor C17H21NO4 is\n\u201ccocaine\u201dtout court, and the Government cites no source\nthat uses \u201ccocaine base\u201d to refer to C17H21NO4 (save lower-court\nopinions construing the statute at issue in this case). Therefore,\nthere is no \u201csettled meaning\u201d\u2014scientific or otherwise\u2014of \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d for us to apply to\n\u00a7841(b)(1).Footnote\n9The statute itself gives us good reason\nto reject DePierre\u2019s reading. Substituting \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d for\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d would mean that clause (iii) only applies to a\n\u201cmixture or substance \u2026 which contains [crack cocaine].\u201d But crack\ncocaine is itself a \u201csubstance\u201d involved in drug offenses; it is\nthe end product that is bought, sold, and consumed. We are aware of\nno substance that \u201ccontains\u201d crack\ncocaine.Footnote\n10DePierre makes a similar argument with\nrespect to coca leaves: Because they contain chemically basic\ncocaine, he contends, under the Government\u2019s interpretation\noffenses involving coca leaves will never be subject to the lower\nquantity threshold associated with subclause (I), rendering that\nprovision superfluous. For reasons discussed later, seeinfra, at 15\u201316, we are not\nconvinced.Footnote\n11At the time the ADAA was enacted, the\ndefinition of \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d in the same subchapter of the United\nStates Code included, as relevant, the\nfollowing:\u201c(C) Coca leaves, except\ncoca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine,\necgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine or their salts have been\nremoved.\u201c(D) Cocaine, its salts,\noptical and geometric isomers, and salts of\nisomers.\u201c(E) Ecgonine, its\nderivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of\nisomers.\u201c(F) Any compound, mixture,\nor preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances\nreferred to in [the preceding] subparagraphs \u2026\u00a0. \u201d 21 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7802(17) (1982 ed., Supp.\nIII).Accordingly, the likely explanation for the\nADAA\u2019s curious structure is that Congress simply adopted this\npreexisting enumeration of cocaine-related controlled substances,\nand then engrafted clause (iii) to provide enhanced penalties for\nthe subset of offenses involving chemically basic\ncocaine.Footnote\n12It appears that Congress itself is of\nthe view that coca leaves contain \u201ccocaine,\u201d as subclause (I)\nexempts offenses involving \u201ccoca leaves from which cocaine \u2026 ha[s]\nbeen removed.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I),\n(B)(ii)(I).Footnote\n13We also disagree with DePierre\u2019s\ncontention that Congress\u2019 failure to reject the Guidelines\ndefinition of \u201ccocaine base\u201d means that it has effectively adopted\nthat interpretation with respect to the statute. SeeKimbroughv.United States,552 U. S. 85, 106 (2007) (\u201cOrdinarily,\nwe resist reading congressional intent into congressional\ninaction\u201d).Footnote\n14In defining \u201ccocaine base\u201d as \u201ccrack,\u201d\nthe Commission explained that \u201cforms of cocaine base other than\ncrack\u201d are treated as \u201ccocaine\u201d for purposes of the Guidelines.\nUSSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov. 1, 1993). This includes coca\npaste, which the Commission described as \u201can intermediate step in\nthe processing of coca leaves into cocaine hydrochloride.\u201dIbid.As we have explained, however, coca paste is a\nsmokeable form of cocaine in its own right, and we see no reason\nwhy, as a statutory matter, it should be subject to lesser\npenalties than crack or\nfreebase.",
