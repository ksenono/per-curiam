For years they have enforced a judicially created tax\nbreak for out-of-state Internet and mail-order firms at the expense\nof in-state brick-and-mortar rivals. Seeante,at 12\u201313;Direct Marketing Assn.v.Brohl, 814 F. 3d, 1129,\n1150 (CA10 2016) (Gorsuch, J. concurring). As Justice White\nrecognized 26 years ago, judges have no authority to construct a\ndiscriminatory \u201ctax shelter\u201d like this.Quill,supra,at 329 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). The\nCourt is right to correct the mistake and I am pleased to join its\nopinion.My agreement with the Court\u2019s discussion of the\nhistory of our dormant commerce clause jurisprudence, however,\nshould not be mistaken for agreement with all aspects of the\ndoctrine. The Commerce Clause is found in Article I and authorizesCongressto regulate interstate commerce. Meanwhile our\ndormant commerce cases suggest Article IIIcourtsmay\ninvalidate state laws that offend no congressional statute. Whether\nand how much of this can be squared with the text of the Commerce\nClause, justified bystare decisis, or defended as\nmisbranded products of federalism or antidiscrimination imperatives\nflowing from Article IV\u2019s Privileges and Immunities Clause are\nquestions for another day. SeeEnergy & Environment Legal\nInst.v.Epel, 793 F.3d 1169, 1171 (CA10 2015);Comptroller of Treasury of Md.v.Wynne, 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 1\u20133);Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.v.Town of\nHarrison, 520 U.\u00a0S. 564, 610\u2013620 (1997) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). Today we putBellas HessandQuillto\nrest and rightly end the paradox of condemning interstate\ndiscrimination in the national economy while promoting it\nourselves.",
