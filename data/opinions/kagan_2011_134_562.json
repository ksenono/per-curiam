    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTNASA V. NELSON562 U. S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-530NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMIN- ISTRATION,\net\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.ROBERT M. NELSON\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[January 19, 2011]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.In two cases decided more than 30\nyears ago, this Court referred broadly to a constitutional privacy\n\u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201dWhalenv.Roe,429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600 (1977);Nixon v.Administrator of General Services,433 U. S. 425,\n457 (1977). Respondents in this case, federal contract employees at\na Government laboratory, claim that two parts of a standard\nemployment background investigation violate their rights underWhalenandNixon. Respondents challenge a section\nof a form questionnaire that asks employees about treatment or\ncounseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object to certain\nopen-ended questions on a form sent to employees\u2019 designated\nreferences.We assume, without deciding, that the\nConstitution protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned inWhalenandNixon. We hold, however, that the\nchallenged portions of the Government\u2019s background check do not\nviolate this right in the present case. The Government\u2019s interests\nas employer and proprietor in managing its internal operations,\ncombined with the protections against public dissemination provided\nby the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552a, satisfy any\n\u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure\u201d that may \u201carguably ha[ve] its\nroots in the Constitution.\u201dWhalen,supra, at\n599, 605.IAThe National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA) is an independent federal agency\ncharged with planning and conducting the Government\u2019s \u201cspace\nactivities.\u201d Pub. L. 111\u2013314, \u00a73, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a720112(a)(1). NASA\u2019s workforce numbers in the tens of thousands of\nemployees. While many of these workers are federal civil servants,\na substantial majority are employed directly by Government\ncontractors. Contract employees play an important role in NASA\u2019s\nmission, and their duties are functionally equivalent to those\nperformed by civil servants.One NASA facility, the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, is staffed\nexclusively by contract employees. NASA owns JPL, but the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility\nunder a Government contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for\ndeep-space robotics and communications. Most of this country\u2019s\nunmanned space missions\u2014from the Explorer 1 satellite in 1958 to\nthe Mars Rovers of today\u2014have been developed and run by JPL. JPL\nscientists contribute to NASA earth-observation and\ntechnology-development projects. Many JPL employees also engage in\npure scientific research on topics like \u201cthe star formation history\nof the universe\u201d and \u201cthe fundamental properties of quantum\nfluids.\u201d App. 64\u201365, 68.Twenty-eight JPL employees are respondents\nhere. Many of them have worked at the lab for decades, and none has\never been the subject of a Government background investigation. At\nthe time when respondents were hired, background checks were\nstandard only for federal civil servants. See Exec. Order No.\n10450, 3 CFR 936 (1949\u20131953 Comp.). In some instances, individual\ncontracts required background checks for the employees of federal\ncontractors, but no blanket policy was in place.The Government has recently taken steps to\neliminate this two-track approach to background investigations.\nIn\u00a02004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission prompted the\nPresident to order new, uniform identification standards for\n\u201c[f]ederal employees,\u201d including \u201ccontractor employees.\u201d Homeland\nSecurity Presidential Directive/HSPD\u201312\u2014Policy for a Common\nIdentification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,\nPublic Papers of the President, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Aug. 27,\np.\u00a01765 (2007) (hereinafter HSPD\u201312), App. 127. The Department\nof Commerce implemented this directive by mandating that contract\nemployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a\nstandard background check, typically the National Agency Check with\nInquiries (NACI). National Inst. of Standards and Technology,\nPersonal Identity Verification of Federal Employees &\nContractors, pp. iii\u2013vi, 1\u20138, 6 (FIPS PUB 201\u20131, Mar. 2006)\n(hereinafter FIPS PUB 201\u20131), App. 131\u2013150, 144\u2013145.[Footnote 1]An October 2007 deadline was set for\ncompletion of these investigations. Memorandum from Joshua B.\nBolten, Director, OMB, to the Heads of all Departments and Agencies\n(Aug. 5, 2005), App. 112. In January 2007, NASA modified its\ncontract with Cal Tech to reflect the new background-check\nrequirement. JPL management informed employees that anyone failing\nto complete the NACI process by October 2007 would be denied access\nto JPL and would face termination by Cal Tech.BThe NACI process has long been\nthe standard background investigation for prospective civil\nservants. The process begins when the applicant or employee fills\nout a form questionnaire. Employees who work in \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d\npositions (as all respondents here do) complete Standard Form 85\n(SF\u201385). Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Standard Form 85,\nQuestionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, App. 88\u201395.[Footnote 2]Most of the questions on SF\u201385\nseek basic biographical information: name, address, prior\nresidences, education, employment history, and personal and\nprofessional references. The form also asks about citizenship,\nselective-service registration, and military service. The last\nquestion asks whether the employee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied,\nor manufactured illegal drugs\u201d in the last year.Id.,at\n94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide details,\nincluding information about \u201cany treatment or counseling received.\u201dIbid.A \u201ctruthful response,\u201d the form notes, cannot be\nused as evidence against the employee in a criminal proceeding.Ibid.The employee must certify that all responses on the\nform are true and must sign a release authorizing the Government to\nobtain personal information from schools, employers, and others\nduring its investigation.Once a completed SF\u201385 is on file, the \u201cagency\ncheck\u201d and \u201cinquiries\u201d begin. 75 Fed. Reg. 5359 (2010). The\nGovernment runs the information provided by the employee through\nFBI and other federal-agency databases. It also sends out form\nquestionnaires to the former employers, schools, landlords, and\nreferences listed on SF\u201385. The particular form at issue in this\ncase\u2014the Investigative Request for Personal Information, Form\n42\u2014goes to the employee\u2019s former landlords and references.Ibid.[Footnote 3]Form 42 is a two-page document that takes\nabout five minutes to complete. Seeibid. It explains to\nthe reference that \u201c[y]our name has been provided by\u201d a particular\nemployee or applicant to help the Government determine that\nperson\u2019s \u201csuitability for employment or a security clearance.\u201d App.\n96\u201397. After several preliminary questions about the extent of the\nreference\u2019s associations with the employee, the form asks if the\nreference has \u201cany reason to question\u201d the employee\u2019s \u201chonesty or\ntrustworthiness.\u201dId.,at 97. It also asks if the\nreference knows of any \u201cadverse information\u201d concerning the\nemployee\u2019s \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial integrity,\u201d \u201cabuse\nof alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional stability,\u201d \u201cgeneral\nbehavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201dIbid. If \u201cyes\u201d\nis checked for any of these categories, the form calls for an\nexplanation in the space below. That space is also available for\nproviding \u201cadditional information\u201d (\u201cderogatory\u201d or \u201cfavorable\u201d)\nthat may bear on \u201csuitability for government employment or a\nsecurity clearance.\u201dIbid.All responses to SF\u201385 and Form 42 are subject\nto the protections of the Privacy Act. The Act authorizes the\nGovernment to keep records pertaining to an individual only when\nthey are \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to an end \u201crequired to be\naccomplished\u201d by law. 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552a(e)(1). Individuals are\npermitted to access their records and request amendments to them.\n\u00a7\u00a7552a(d)(1),(2). Subject to certain exceptions, the Government may\nnot disclose records pertaining to an individual without that\nindividual\u2019s written consent. \u00a7552a(b).CAbout two months before the\nOctober 2007 deadline for completing the NACI, respondents brought\nthis suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check\nprocess violates a constitutional right to informational privacy.\nApp. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief).[Footnote 4] The District Court denied\nrespondents\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth\nCircuit granted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F.\u00a03d 713\n(2007), and later reversed the District Court\u2019s order. The court\nheld that portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42 are likely\nunconstitutional and should be preliminarily enjoined. 512\nF.\u00a03d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F.\u00a03d 865\n(2008).Turning first to SF\u201385, the Court\nof Appeals noted respondents\u2019 concession \u201cthat most of the\nquestions\u201d on the form are \u201cunproblematic\u201d and do not \u201cimplicate\nthe constitutional right to informational privacy.\u201d 530 F.\u00a03d,\nat 878. But the court determined that the \u201cgroup of questions\nconcerning illegal drugs\u201d required closer scrutiny.Ibid.\nApplying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF\u201385\u2019s inquiries into\nrecent involvement with drugs as \u201cnecessary to further the\ngovernment\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d in combating illegal-drug use.Id., at 879. The court went on to hold, however, that the\nportion of the form requiring disclosure of drug \u201ctreatment or\ncounseling\u201d furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to\nbe held unconstitutional.Ibid.Form 42, in the Court of Appeals\u2019 estimation,\nwas even \u201cmore problematic.\u201dIbid.The form\u2019s \u201copen-ended\nand highly private\u201d questions, the court concluded, were not\n\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet the Government\u2019s interests in verifying\ncontractors\u2019 identities and \u201censuring the security of the JPL.\u201dId., at 881, 880. As a result, the court held, these\n\u201copen-ended\u201d questions, like the drug-treatment question on SF\u201385,\nlikely violate respondents\u2019 informational-privacy rights.[Footnote 5]Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth\nCircuit denied rehearing en banc. 568 F.\u00a03d 1028 (2009). We\ngranted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).IIAs noted, respondents contend\nthat portions of SF\u201385 and Form 42 violate their \u201cright to\ninformational privacy.\u201d Brief for Respondents 15. This Court\nconsidered a similar claim inWhalen,429 U. S. 589, which concerned New\nYork\u2019s practice of collecting \u201cthe names and addresses of all\npersons\u201d prescribed dangerous drugs with both \u201clegitimate and\nillegitimate uses.\u201dId., at 591. In discussing that claim,\nthe Court said that \u201c[t]he cases sometimes characterized as\nprotecting \u2018privacy\u2019\u00a0\u201d actually involved \u201cat least two\ndifferent kinds of interests\u201d: one, an \u201cinterest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters\u201d;[Footnote 6] the other, an interest in \u201cmaking certain\nkinds of important decisions\u201d free from government\ninterference.[Footnote 7] The\npatients who brought suit inWhalenargued that New York\u2019s\nstatute \u201cthreaten[ed] to impair\u201d both their \u201cnondisclosure\u201d\ninterests and their interests in making healthcare decisions\nindependently.Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld the\nstatute as a \u201creasonable exercise of New York\u2019s broad police\npowers.\u201dId., at 598.Whalenacknowledged that\nthe disclosure of \u201cprivate information\u201d to the State was an\n\u201cunpleasant invasion of privacy,\u201did., at 602, but the\nCourt pointed out that the New York statute contained \u201csecurity\nprovisions\u201d that protected against \u201cpublic disclosure\u201d of patients\u2019\ninformation,id., at 600\u2013601. This sort of \u201cstatutory or\nregulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d of \u201caccumulated\nprivate data\u201d was sufficient, in the Court\u2019s view, to protect a\nprivacy interest that \u201carguably ha[d] its roots in the\nConstitution.\u201dId., at 605\u2013606. The Court thus concluded\nthat the statute did not violate \u201cany right or liberty protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\u201dId., at 606.Four months later, the Court referred again\nto a constitutional \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure.\u201dNixon,433 U. S., at 457 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Former President Nixon brought a challenge to the\nPresidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat.\n1695, note following 44 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72111, a statute that\nrequired him to turn over his presidential papers and tape\nrecordings for archival review and screening. 433 U. S., at\n455\u2013465. In a section of the opinion entitled \u201cPrivacy,\u201d the Court\naddressed a combination of claims that the review required by this\nAct violated the former President\u2019s \u201cFourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]\u201d\nrights.Id., at 455, and n.\u00a018, 458\u2013459. The Court\nrejected those challenges after concluding that the Act at issue,\nlike the statute inWhalen, contained protections against\n\u201cundue dissemination of private materials.\u201d 433 U. S., at 458.\nIndeed, the Court observed that the former President\u2019s claim was\n\u201cweaker\u201d than the one \u201cfound wanting . . . inWhalen,\u201d as\nthe Government was required to return immediately all \u201cpurely\nprivate papers and recordings\u201d identified by the archivists.Id., at 458\u2013459. Citing Fourth Amendment precedent, the\nCourt also stated that the public interest in preserving\npresidential papers outweighed any \u201clegitimate expectation of\nprivacy\u201d that the former President may have enjoyed.Id.,at 458 (citingKatzv.United States,389 U. S. 347(1967);Camarav.Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco,387 U. S. 523(1967); andTerryv.Ohio,392 U. S. 1(1968)).[Footnote 8]The Court announced the decision inNixonin the waning days of October Term 1976. Since then,\nthe Court has said little else on the subject of an \u201cindividual\ninterest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201dWhalen,supra, at 599;Nixon,supra, at 457. A few opinions have mentioned the concept\nin passing and in other contexts. SeeDepartment of\nJusticev.Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press,489 U. S. 749,\n762\u2013763 (1989);New Yorkv.Ferber,458 U. S. 747, 759,\nn.\u00a010 (1982). But no other decision has squarely addressed a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy.[Footnote 9]IIIAs was our approach inWhalen, we will assume for present purposes that the\nGovernment\u2019s challenged inquiries implicate a privacy interest of\nconstitutional significance. 429 U. S., at 599, 605.[Footnote 10] We hold, however, that,\nwhatever the scope of this interest, it does not prevent the\nGovernment from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on\nSF\u201385 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is\nsubject to the Privacy Act\u2019s safeguards against public\ndisclosure.A1As an initial matter, judicial\nreview of the Government\u2019s challenged inquiries must take into\naccount the context in which they arise. When the Government asks\nrespondents and their references to fill out SF\u201385 and Form 42, it\ndoes not exercise its sovereign power \u201cto regulate or license.\u201dCafeteria & Restaurant Workersv.McElroy,367 U. S. 886,\n896 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts the challenged\nbackground checks in its capacity \u201cas proprietor\u201d and manager of\nits \u201cinternal operation.\u201dIbid. Time and again our cases\nhave recognized that the Government has a much freer hand in\ndealing \u201cwith citizen employees than it does when it brings its\nsovereign power to bear on citizens at large.\u201dEngquistv.Oregon Dept. of Agriculture,553 U. S. 591, 598\n(2008);Watersv.Churchill,511 U. S. 661, 674\n(1994) (plurality opinion). This distinction is grounded on the\n\u201ccommon-sense realization\u201d that if every \u201cemployment decision\nbecame a constitutional matter,\u201d the Government could not function.\nSeeConnickv.Myers,461 U. S. 138, 143\n(1983); see alsoBishopv.Wood,426 U. S. 341, 350\n(1976) (\u201cThe Due Process Clause . . . is not a guarantee against\nincorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions\u201d).An assessment of the\nconstitutionality of the challenged portions of SF\u201385 and Form 42\nmust account for this distinction. The questions challenged by\nrespondents are part of a standard employment background check of\nthe sort used by millions of private employers. See Brief for\nConsumer Data Indus. Assn. et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae2\n(hereinafter CDIA Brief) (\u201c[M]ore than 88% of U. S. companies \u2026\nperform background checks on their employees\u201d). The Government\nitself has been conducting employment investigations since the\nearliest days of the Republic. L. White, The Federalists: A Study\nin Administrative History 262\u2013263 (1948); see OPM, Biography of An\nIdeal: History of the Federal Civil Service 8 (2002) (noting that\nPresident Washington \u201cset a high standard\u201d for federal office and\nfinalized appointments only after \u201cinvestigating [candidates\u2019]\ncapabilities and reputations\u201d). Since 1871, the President has\nenjoyed statutory authority to \u201cascertain the fitness of\napplicants\u201d for the civil service \u201cas to age, health, character,\nknowledge and ability for the employment sought,\u201d Act of Mar. 3,\n1871, Rev. Stat. \u00a71753, as amended, 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73301(2), and\nthat Act appears to have been regarded as a codification of\nestablished practice.[Footnote\n11] Standard background investigations similar to those at\nissue here became mandatory for all candidates for the federal\ncivil service in 1953. Exec. Order No.\u00a010450, 3 CFR 936. And\nthe particular investigations challenged in this case arose from a\ndecision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees\nrequiring long-term access to federal facilities. See HSPD\u201312, at\n1765, App. 127; FIPS PUB 201\u20131, at iii\u2013vi, 1\u20138, App. 131\u2013150.As this long history suggests, the Government\nhas an interest in conducting basic employment background checks.\nReasonable investigations of applicants and employees aid the\nGovernment in ensuring the security of its facilities and in\nemploying a competent, reliable workforce. SeeEngquist,supra, at 598\u2013599. Courts must keep those interests in\nmind when asked to go line-by-line through the Government\u2019s\nemployment forms and to scrutinize the choice and wording of the\nquestions they contain.Respondents argue that, because they are\ncontract employees and not civil servants, the Government\u2019s broad\nauthority in managing its affairs should apply with diminished\nforce. But the Government\u2019s interest as \u201cproprietor\u201d in managing\nits operations,Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers,supra, at 896, does not turn on such formalities. SeeBoard of Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee Cty.v.Umbehr,518 U. S. 668,\n678, 679 (1996) (formal distinctions such as whether a \u201cservice\nprovider\u201d has a \u201ccontract of employment or a contract for services\u201d\nwith the government is a \u201cvery poor proxy\u201d for constitutional\ninterests at stake). The fact that respondents\u2019 direct employment\nrelationship is with Cal Tech\u2014which operates JPL under a Government\ncontract\u2014says very little about the interests at stake in this\ncase. The record shows that, as a \u201cpractical matter,\u201d there are no\n\u201c[r]elevant distinctions\u201d between the duties performed by NASA\u2019s\ncivil-service workforce and its contractor workforce. App. 221. The\ntwo classes of employees perform \u201cfunctionally equivalent duties,\u201d\nand the extent of employees\u2019 \u201caccess to NASA \u2026 facilities\u201d turns\nnot on formal status but on the nature of \u201cthe jobs they perform.\u201dIbid.At JPL, in particular, the work that contract\nemployees perform is critical to NASA\u2019s mission. Respondents in\nthis case include \u201cthe lead trouble-shooter for \u2026 th[e] $568\n[million]\u201d Kepler space observatory, 7 Record 396; the leader of\nthe program that \u201ctests \u2026 all new technology that NASA will use in\nspace,\u201d App. 60; and one of the lead \u201ctrajectory designers for \u2026\nthe Galileo Project and the Apollo Moon landings,\u201did.,at\n62. This is important work, and all of it is funded with a\nmultibillion dollar investment from the American taxpayer. See\nNASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory Annual Report 09, p.\u00a035\n(2010), online at\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The\nGovernment has a strong interest in conducting basic background\nchecks into the contract employees minding the store at\nJPL.[Footnote 12]2With these interests in view, we\nconclude that the challenged portions of both SF\u201385 and Form 42\nconsist of reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further\nthe Government\u2019s interests in managing its internal operations. SeeEngquist, 553 U. S., at 598\u2013599;Whalen,429 U.\nS., at 597\u2013598. As to SF\u201385, the only part of the form challenged\nhere is its request for information about \u201cany treatment or\ncounseling received\u201d for illegal-drug use within the previous year.\nThe \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question, however, must be considered\nin context. It is a followup to SF\u201385\u2019s inquiry into whether the\nemployee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal\ndrugs\u201d during the past year. The Government has good reason to ask\nemployees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like any employer,\nthe Government is entitled to have its projects staffed by\nreliable, law-abiding persons who will \u201c\u00a0\u2018efficiently and\neffectively\u2019\u00a0\u201d discharge their duties. SeeEngquist,supra, at 598\u2013599. Questions about illegal-drug use are a\nuseful way of figuring out which persons have these\ncharacteristics. See,e.g., Breen & Matusitz, An\nUpdated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in the\nWorkplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 434\n(2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated with workplace\nproductivity).In context, the follow-up\nquestion on \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d for recent illegal-drug use\nis also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government,\nrecognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical\nissue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who are\ntaking steps to address and overcome their problems. The Government\nthus uses responses to the \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question as a\nmitigating factor in determining whether to grant contract\nemployees long-term access to federal facilities.[Footnote 13]This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane,\napproach, and respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the\nGovernment\u2019s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigating factor\nin its contractor credentialing decisions. Respondents\u2019 argument is\nthat, if drug treatment is only used to mitigate, then the\nGovernment should change the mandatory phrasing of SF\u201385\u2014\u201cInclude\n[in your answer] any treatment or counseling received\u201d\u2014so as to\nmake a response optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory\n\u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question is unconstitutional, in\nrespondents\u2019 view, because it is \u201cmore intrusive than necessary to\nsatisfy the government\u2019s objective.\u201d Brief for Respondents 26; 530\nF.\u00a03d, at 879 (holding that \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question\nshould be enjoined because the form \u201cappears tocompeldisclosure\u201d).We reject the argument that the Government,\nwhen it requests job-related personal information in an employment\nbackground check, has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that\nits questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least restrictive means of\nfurthering its interests. So exacting a standard runs directly\ncontrary toWhalen. The patients inWhalen, much\nlike respondents here, argued that New York\u2019s statute was\nunconstitutional because the State could not \u201cdemonstrate the\nnecessity\u201d of its program. 429 U. S., at 596. The Court quickly\nrejected that argument, concluding that New York\u2019s collection of\npatients\u2019 prescription information could \u201cnot be held\nunconstitutional simply because\u201d a court viewed it as \u201cunnecessary,\nin whole or in part.\u201dId.,at 596\u2013597.That analysis applies with even greater force\nwhere the Government acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager\nof its internal affairs. SeeEngquist,supra, at\n598\u2013599. SF\u201385\u2019s \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question reasonably\nseeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who are\nattempting to overcome their problems. The Government\u2019s considered\nposition is that phrasing the question in more permissive terms\nwould result in a lower response rate, and the question\u2019s\neffectiveness in identifying illegal-drug users who are suitable\nfor employment would be \u201cmaterially reduced.\u201d Reply Brief for\nPetitioners 19. That is a reasonable position, falling within the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018wide latitude\u2019\u00a0\u201d granted the Government in its\ndealings with employees. SeeEngquist,supra, at\n600.3The Court of Appeals also held\nthat the broad, \u201copen-ended questions\u201d on Form 42 likely violate\nrespondents\u2019 informational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants\u2019\ndesignated references and landlords for \u201cinformation\u201d bearing on\n\u201csuitability for government employment or a security clearance.\u201d\nApp. 97. In a series of questions, the Government asks if the\nreference has any \u201cadverse information\u201d about the applicant\u2019s\n\u201chonesty or trustworthiness,\u201d \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial\nintegrity,\u201d \u201cabuse of alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional\nstability,\u201d \u201cgeneral behavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201dIbid.These open-ended inquiries,\nlike the drug-treatment question on SF\u201385, are reasonably aimed at\nidentifying capable employees who will faithfully conduct the\nGovernment\u2019s business. See Engquist,supra, at\n598\u2013599. Asking an applicant\u2019s designated references broad,\nopen-ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool\nfor separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would be a\ntruly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a person might\nnot be suitable for a particular job, and references do not have\nall day to answer a laundry list of specific questions. See CDIA\nBrief 6\u20137 (references \u201ctypically have limited time to answer\nquestions from potential employers,\u201d and \u201copen-ended questions\u201d\nyield more relevant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by\ncontrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg.\n5359.The reasonableness of such open-ended\nquestions is illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and\nprivate sectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over\n1.8 million times annually.Ibid.In addition, the use of\nopen-ended questions in employment background checks appears to be\nequally commonplace in the private sector. See,e.g., S.\nBock et\u00a0al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compliance Guide, Exh.\n20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference Checks on Job Applicants\n(\u201cFollowing are the guidelines for conducting a telephone reference\ncheck: \u2026 Ask open-ended questions, then wait for the respondent to\nanswer\u201d); M. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (\u201cAlso\nask, \u2018Is there anything else I need to know about [candidate\u2019s\nname]?\u2019 This kind of open-ended question may turn up all kinds of\ninformation you wouldn\u2019t have gotten any other way\u201d). The use of\nsimilar open-ended questions by the Government is reasonable and\nfurthers its interests in managing its operations.B1Not only are SF\u201385 and Form 42\nreasonable in light of the Government interests at stake, they are\nalso subject to substantial protections against disclosure to the\npublic. BothWhalenandNixonrecognized that\ngovernment \u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic\npurposes\u201d may pose a threat to privacy.Whalen, 429 U. S.,\nat 605; seeNixon433 U. S., at 457\u2013458, 462. But both\ndecisions also stated that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid\nunwarranted disclosures\u201d generally allays these privacy concerns.Whalen,supra, at 605;Nixon,supra,at 458\u2013459. The Court inWhalen, relying\non New York\u2019s \u201csecurity provisions\u201d prohibiting public disclosure,\nturned aside a challenge to the collection of patients\u2019\nprescription information. 429 U. S., at 594, and n.\u00a012,\n600\u2013601, 605. InNixon,the Court rejected what it\nregarded as an even \u201cweaker\u201d claim by the former President because\nthe Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act \u201c[n]ot\nonly . . . mandate[d] regulations\u201d against \u201cundue dissemination,\u201d\nbut also required immediate return of any \u201cpurely private\u201d\nmaterials flagged by the Government\u2019s archivists. 433 U. S., at\n458\u2013459.Respondents in this case, like\nthe patients inWhalenand former President Nixon, attack\nonly the Government\u2019scollectionof information on SF\u201385\nand Form 42. And here, no less than inWhalenandNixon, the information collected is shielded by statute\nfrom \u201cunwarranted disclosur[e].\u201d SeeWhalen,supra,at 605. The Privacy Act, which covers all\ninformation collected during the background-check process, allows\nthe Government to maintain records \u201cabout an individual\u201d only to\nthe extent the records are \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a\npurpose authorized by law. 5 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552a(e)(1). The Act\nrequires written consent before the Government may disclose records\npertaining to any individual. \u00a7552a(b). And the Act imposes\ncriminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure\nobligations. \u00a7552a(i)(1). These requirements, as we have noted,\ngive \u201cforceful recognition\u201d to a Government employee\u2019s interest in\nmaintaining the \u201cconfidentiality of sensitive information . . . in\nhis personnel files.\u201dDetroit Edison Co.v.NLRB,440 U. S. 301,\n318, n.\u00a016 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure inWhalenandNixon, they \u201cevidence a proper\nconcern\u201d for individual privacy.Whalen,supra,\nat 605;Nixon,supra, at 458\u2013459.2Notwithstanding these safeguards,\nrespondents argue that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s\ndisclosure bar, see \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(1)\u2013(12), leave its protections too\nporous to supply a meaningful check against \u201cunwarranted\ndisclosures,\u201dWhalen,supra, at 605. Respondents\npoint in particular to what they describe as a \u201cbroad\u201d exception\nfor \u201croutine use[s],\u201d defined as uses that are \u201ccompatible with the\npurpose for which the record was collected.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7552a(b)(3),\n(a)(7).Respondents\u2019 reliance on these\nexceptions rests on an incorrect reading of both our precedents and\nthe terms of the Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court inWhalenandNixonreferred approvingly to\nstatutory or regulatory protections against \u201cunwarranteddisclosures\u201d and \u201cunduedissemination\u201d of personal\ninformation collected by the Government.Whalen,supra, at 605;Nixon,supra, at 458.\nNeither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is needed to\nsatisfy privacy interests that may be \u201croot[ed] in the\nConstitution.\u201dWhalen,supra, at 605. InWhalen, the New York statute prohibiting \u201c[p]ublic\ndisclosure of the identity of patients\u201d was itself subject to\nseveral exceptions. 429 U. S., at 594\u2013595, and n.\u00a012. InNixon, the protections against \u201cundue dissemination\u201d\nmentioned in the opinion were not even before the Court, but were\nto be included in forthcoming regulations \u201cmandate[d]\u201d by the\nchallenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; seeid., at 437\u2013439\n(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the Act\u2019s\n\u201cfacial validity\u201d and was not considering the Administrator\u2019s\nforthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact that the Privacy\nAct\u2019s nondisclosure requirement is subject to exceptions does not\nshow that the statute provides insufficient protection against\npublic disclosure.Nor does the substance of the \u201croutine use\u201d\nexception relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public\ndissemination. None of the authorized \u201croutine use[s]\u201d of\nrespondents\u2019 background-check information allows for release to the\npublic. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859\u201345860, 45862 (2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084\n(1995), as amended, 75 Fed. Reg. 28307 (2010). Rather, the\nestablished \u201croutine use[s]\u201d consist of limited, reasonable steps\ndesigned to complete the background-check process in an efficient\nand orderly manner. SeeWhalen,supra, at 602\n(approving disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health\nemployees that were not \u201cmeaningfully distinguishable\u201d from routine\ndisclosures \u201cassociated with many facets of health care\u201d). One\nroutine use, for example, involves a limited disclosure to persons\nfilling out Form 42 so that designated references can \u201cidentify the\nindividual\u201d at issue and can understand the \u201cnature and purpose of\nthe investigation.\u201d App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review\neach completed SF\u201385 to verify that all requested information has\nbeen provided.Id.,at 211. These designated JPL employees\nmay not \u201cdisclose any information contained in the form to anyone\nelse,\u201dibid., and Cal Tech is not given access to adverse\ninformation uncovered during the Government\u2019s background check,id.,at 207\u2013208. The \u201cremote possibility\u201d of public\ndisclosure created by these narrow \u201croutine use[s]\u201d does not\nundermine the Privacy Act\u2019s substantial protections. SeeWhalen, 429 U. S., at 601\u2013602 (\u201cremote possibility\u201d that\nstatutory security provisions will \u201cprovide inadequate protection\nagainst unwarranted disclosures\u201d not a sufficient basis for\nstriking down statute).Citing past violations of the Privacy\nAct,[Footnote 14]\nrespondents note that it is possible that their personal\ninformation could be disclosed as a result of a similar breach. But\ndata breaches are a possibility any time the Government stores\ninformation. As the Court recognized inWhalen, the mere\npossibility that security measures will fail provides no \u201cproper\nground\u201d for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices.Ibid.Respondents also\ncite a portion of SF\u201385 that warns of possible disclosure \u201c[t]o the\nnews media or the general public.\u201d App. 89. By its terms, this\nexception allows public disclosure only where release is \u201cin the\npublic interest\u201d and would not result in \u201can unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.\u201dIbid. Respondents have not cited any\nexample of such a disclosure, nor have they identified any\nplausible scenario in which their information might be unduly\ndisclosed under this exception.[Footnote 15]In light of the protection provided by the\nPrivacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged\nportions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an\nemployment background check, we conclude that the Government\u2019s\ninquiries do not violate a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy.Whalen,supra, at 605.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Kagan took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Footnote 1As alternatives to the NACI process, the\nDepartment of Commerce also authorized federal agencies to use\nanother \u201cOffice of Personnel Management \u2026 or National Security\ncommunity investigation required for Federal employment.\u201d App. 145.\nNone of these alternative background checks are at issue here.Footnote 2For public-trust and national-security\npositions, more detailed forms are required.

No class has\nbeen certified.Footnote 5In the Ninth Circuit, respondents also\nchallenged the criteria that they believe the Government will use\nto determine their \u201csuitability\u201d for employment at JPL. Respondents\nrelied on a document, which had been temporarily posted on the JPL\nintranet, that listed factors purportedly bearing on suitability\nfor federal employment. App. 98\u2013104. Among the listed factors were\na failure to \u201cmee[t] financial obligations,\u201d \u201chealth issues,\u201d and\n\u201cmental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric issues.\u201dId.,at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under\nthe heading \u201cCriminal or Immoral Conduct,\u201d included \u201cindecent\nexposure,\u201d \u201cvoyeurism,\u201d \u201cindecent proposal[s],\u201d and \u201ccarnal\nknowledge.\u201dId.,at 98. The document also stated that\nwhile \u201chomosexuality,\u201d \u201cadultery,\u201d and \u201cillegitimate children\u201d were\nnot \u201csuitability\u201d issues in and of themselves, they might pose\n\u201csecurity issue[s]\u201d if circumstances indicated a \u201csusceptibility to\ncoercion or blackmail.\u201dId.,at 102. The Court of Appeals\nrejected respondents\u2019 \u201cchallenges to . . . suitability\ndetermination[s]\u201d as unripe. 530 F.\u00a03d, at 873. Although\nrespondents did not file a cross-petition from that portion of the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment, they nonetheless discuss these\nsuitability criteria at some length in their brief before this\nCourt. Respondents\u2019 challenge to these criteria is not before us.\nWe note, however, the Acting Solicitor General\u2019s statement at oral\nargument that \u201cNASA will not and does not use\u201d the document to\nwhich respondents object \u201cto make contractor credentialing\ndecisions.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.Footnote 6429 U.

Many courts hold that disclosure of\nat least some kinds of personal information should be subject to a\ntest that balances the government\u2019s interests against the\nindividual\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosure.E.g.,Barryv.New York, 712 F.\u00a02d 1554, 1559 (CA2\n1983);FraternalOrder of Policev.Philadelphia, 812 F.\u00a02d 105, 110 (CA3 1987);Woodlandv.Houston, 940 F.\u00a02d 134, 138 (CA5\n1991)(per curiam); In re Crawford, 194 F.\u00a03d 954,\n959 (CA9 1999);Statev.Russo, 259 Conn. 436,\n459\u2013464, 790 A.\u00a02d 1132, 1147\u20131150 (2002). The Sixth Circuit\nhas held that the right to informational privacy protects only\nintrusions upon interests \u201cthat can be deemed fundamental or\nimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201dJ.\u00a0P.v.DeSanti, 653 F.\u00a02d 1080, 1090 (1981) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The D.\u00a0C. Circuit has expressed\n\u201cgrave doubts\u201d about the existence of a constitutional right to\ninformational privacy.American Federation of Govt.\nEmployeesv.HUD, 118 F.\u00a03d 786, 791 (1997).Footnote 10The opinions concurring in the judgment\ndisagree with this approach and would instead provide a definitive\nanswer to the question whether there is a constitutional right to\ninformational privacy.Post, at 6\u20137 (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.);post, at 1 (opinion of Thomas, J.). One of these\nopinions expresses concern that our failure to do so will \u201char[m]\nour image, if not our self-respect,\u201dpost,at 7 (Scalia,\nJ.), and will cause practical problems,post,at 8\u20139.\nThere are sound reasons for eschewing the concurring opinions\u2019\nrecommended course.\u201cThe premise of our adversarial system is that\nappellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal\ninquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal\nquestions presented and argued by the parties before them.\u201dCarducciv.Regan, 714 F.\u00a02d 171, 177 (CADC\n1983) (opinion for the court by Scalia, J.). In this case,\npetitioners did not ask us to hold that there is no constitutional\nright to informational privacy, and respondents and theiramicithus understandably refrained from addressing that\nissue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a matter of\nthis importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit of\nbriefing by the parties and in which potentialamicihad\nlittle notice that the matter might be decided. See Pet. for Cert.\n15 (\u201cno need in this case\u201d for broad decision on \u201cthe scope of a\nconstitutionally-based right to privacy for certain information\u201d).\nParticularly in cases like this one, where we have only the \u201cscarce\nand open-ended\u201d guideposts of substantive due process to show us\nthe way, seeCollinsv.Harker Heights,503 U. S. 115, 125\n(1992), the Court has repeatedly recognized the benefits of\nproceeding with caution.E.g.,Herrerav.Collins,506 U. S. 390, 417\n(1993) (joined by Scalia, J.)

We take the same approach here that the Court\ntook more than three decades ago inWhalenandNixon, and there is no evidence that those decisions have\ncaused the sky to fall.We therefore decide the case before us and\nleave broader issues for another day.Footnote 11The debate on the 1871 Act in the House of\nRepresentatives contained this exchange on presidential authority\nto conduct background checks:\u201cMr. Peters: Has he not that power [to conduct\nthe proposed investigations of candidates for the civil service]\nnow?\u201cMr. Dawes: He has all that power. If you will\ngo up to the War Department or the Department of the Interior you\nwill see pretty much all of this nailed up on the doors, in the\nform of rules and regulations.\u201d Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess.,\n1935 (1871).Footnote 12In their brief, respondents also rely on the\nfact that many of them have been working at JPL for years and that\nCal Tech previously vetted them through standard \u201cemployment\nreference checks.\u201d Brief for Respondents 52\u201353. The record\nindicates that this may be wrong as a factual matter.E.g., 7 Record 391 (\u201cI have not been required to undergo\nany type of background investigation to maintain my position with\nJPL\u201d);id.,at 397 (\u201cI have never been required to undergo\nany type of background investigation to maintain my position with\nJPL other than \u2026 [one] which required that I provide my name,\nsocial security number, and current address\u201d to facilitate a \u201ccheck\nfor outstanding warrants, arrests, or convictions\u201d);id.,\nat 356, 367, 386\u2013387 (similar). Even if it were correct, the fact\nthat Cal Tech once conducted a background check on respondents does\nnot diminish the Government\u2019s interests in conducting its own\nstandard background check to satisfy itself that contract employees\nshould be granted continued access to the Government\u2019s facility. In\nany event, counsel abandoned this position at oral argument. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 38.Footnote 13Asking about treatment or counseling could\nalso help the Government identify chronic drug abusers for whom,\n\u201cdespite counseling and rehabilitation programs, there is little\nchance for effective rehabilitation.\u201d 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At\noral argument, however, the Acting Solicitor General explained that\nNASA views treatment or counseling solely as a \u201cmitigat[ing]\u201d\nfactor that ameliorates concerns about recent illegal drug use. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 19.Footnote 14E.g., GAO, Personal Information:\nData Breaches are Frequent, but Evidence of Resulting Identity\nTheft is Limited; However, the Full Extent Is Unknown 5, 20 (GAO\n07\u2013737, 2007) (over 3-year period, 788 data breaches occurred at 17\nfederal agencies).Footnote 15Respondents further contend that the Privacy\nAct\u2019s ability to deter unauthorized release of private information\nis significantly hampered by the fact that the statute provides\nonly \u201canex\u00a0postmoney-damages action,\u201d not\ninjunctive relief. Brief for Respondents 44 (citingDoev.Chao,540\nU. S. 614, 635 (2004) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)). Nothing inWhalenorNixonsuggests that any private right\nof action\u2014for money damages or injunctive relief\u2014is needed in order\nto provide sufficient protection against public disclosure.",
