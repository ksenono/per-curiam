From\nthe 1960s through the 1980s, violent gun crime was rampant in\nAmerica. The wave of violence destroyed lives and devastated\ncommunities, particularly in America\u2019s cities. Between 1963 and\n1968, annual murders with firearms rose by a staggering 87 percent,\nand annual aggravated assaults with firearms increased by more than\n230 percent.Faced with an onslaught of violent gun crime and\nits debilitating effects, the American people demanded action. In\n1968, Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun\nControl Act. That law made it a separate federal crime to use or\ncarry a firearm during a federal felony. Despite that and other\nefforts, violent crime with firearms continued at extraordinarily\ndangerous levels. In 1984 and again in 1986, in legislation signed\nby President Reagan, Congress reenacted that provision of the 1968\nAct, with amendments. The law now prohibits, among other things,\nusing or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a federal\n\u201ccrime of violence.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). The law\nmandates substantial prison time for violators.Over the last 33 years, tens of thousands of\n\u00a7924(c) cases have been prosecuted in the federal courts.\nMeanwhile, violent crime with firearms has decreased significantly.\nOver the last 25 years, the annual rate of murders with firearms\nhas dropped by about 50 percent, and the annual rate of nonfatal\nviolent crimes (robberies, aggravated assaults, and sex crimes)\nwith firearms has decreased by about 75 percent. Violent crime in\ngeneral (committed with or without a firearm) has also declined.\nDuring that same time period, both the annual rate of overall\nviolent crime and the annual rate of murders have dropped by almost\n50 percent.Although the level of violent crime in America\nis still very high, especially in certain cities, Americans under\nthe age of 40 probably cannot fully appreciate how much safer most\nAmerican cities and towns are now than they were in the 1960s,\n1970s, and 1980s. Many factors have contributed to the decline of\nviolent crime in America. But one cannot dismiss the effects of\nstate and federal laws that impose steep punishments on those who\ncommit violent crimes with firearms.Yet today, after 33 years and tens of thousands\nof federal prosecutions, the Court suddenly finds a key provision\nof \u00a7924(c) to be unconstitutional because it is supposedly too\nvague. That is a surprising conclusion for the Court to reach about\na federal law that has been applied so often for so long with so\nlittle problem. The Court\u2019s decision today will make it harder to\nprosecute violent gun crimes in the future. The Court\u2019s decision\nalso will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed\nviolent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress\nspecified when enacting \u00a7924(c). The inmates who will be released\nearly are not nonviolent offenders. They are not drug offenders.\nThey are offenders who committed violent crimes with firearms,\noften brutally violent crimes.A decision to strike down a 33-year-old,\noften-prosecuted federal criminal law because it is all of a sudden\nunconstitutionally vague is an extraordinary event in this Court.\nThe Constitution\u2019s separation of powers authorizes this Court to\ndeclare Acts of Congress unconstitutional. That is an awesome\npower. We exercise that power of judicial review in justiciable\ncases to, among other things, ensure that Congress acts within\nconstitutional limits and abides by the separation of powers. But\nwhen we overstep our role in the name of enforcing limits on\nCongress, we do not uphold the separation of powers, we transgress\nthe separation of powers.I fully understand how the Court has arrived at\nits conclusion given the Court\u2019s recent precedents inJohnsonv.United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015),\nandSessionsv.Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nBut this case presents an entirely different question. Those cases\ninvolved statutes that imposed additional penalties based onpriorconvictions. This case involves a statute that focuses\non the defendant\u2019s current conduct during the charged crime. The\nstatute here operates entirely in the present. Under our\nprecedents, this statute therefore is not unconstitutionally vague.\nIt is a serious mistake, in my respectful view, to followJohnsonandDimayaoff the constitutional cliff in\nthis case. I respectfully dissent.[1]ISection 924(c) prohibits using or carrying a\nfirearm during and in relation to a federal \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d or\npossessing a firearm in furtherance of a federal \u201ccrime of\nviolence.\u201d[2] Section 924(c) is\na substantive criminal offense, not a sentence enhancement. The\nGovernment therefore charges a \u00a7924(c) offense in the indictment.\nOrdinarily, when charged under \u00a7924(c), a defendant will be charged\nwith both an underlying federal crime and then also a \u00a7924(c)\noffense. For example, Davis was charged with both conspiracy to\ncommit robbery and a \u00a7924(c) offense. Glover was likewise charged\nwith both conspiracy to commit robbery and a \u00a7924(c) offense.By any measure, Davis and Glover\u2019s conduct\nduring the conspiracy was violent. Davis and Glover committed\nmultiple armed robberies of convenience stores in the early morning\nhours. Those armed robberies followed a pattern: Davis and Glover\n(or Glover and a co-conspirator)\u2014usually covering their faces\u2014would\narrive at a convenience store in the early morning hours in a car\nwith no plates. One of them would point a short-barreled shotgun at\na female employee and order her around. Sometimes, he would point\nthe short-barreled shotgun in her face. Sometimes, he would put the\nshort-barreled shotgun in her side. While one of them was aiming\nthe short-barreled shotgun at the store employee, another would\ntake cigarettes and demand money. Davis and Glover\u2019s crime spree\nended with still more dangerous behavior: a high-speed car chase in\nwet and dangerous driving conditions that culminated in a\ncrash.Section 924(c)(3) lays out the definition of\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7924(c). That definition has\ntwo prongs, either of which can bring a defendant within the scope\nof \u00a7924(c).[3]The first prong of \u00a7924(c)(3) is the elements\nprong. That prong, the Government concedes here, asks whether the\nunderlying crimecategoricallyfits within \u00a7924(c) because\nof the elements of the crime. The judge makes that determination.\nIf the answer is yes, then the judge instructs the jury on the\n\u00a7924(c) offense to simply find whether the defendant used or\ncarried a firearm during and in relation to that underlying crime,\nor possessed a firearm in furtherance of that underlying crime.The Fifth Circuit concluded that Davis and\nGlover\u2019s conspiracy offenses did not fit within the elements prong\nof \u00a7924(c)(3). So the question was whether Davis and Glover were\ncovered by the second prong.The second prong of \u00a7924(c)(3) is the\nsubstantial-risk prong. That prong covers cases beyond those\ncovered by the first prong, the elements prong. Congress sensibly\nwanted to cover defendants who committed crimes that are not\nnecessarily violent by definition under the elements prong, but who\ncommitted crimes with firearms in a way that created a substantial\nrisk that violent force would be used. To that end, the\nsubstantial-risk prong, properly read, focuses not on the elements\nof the underlying crime, but rather on the defendant\u2019s conduct\nduring that crime. If a defendant used or carried a firearm during\nand in relation to the crime,andthe defendant\u2019s conduct\nduring the crime created a substantial risk that physical force may\nbe used, then the defendant may be guilty of a \u00a7924(c) offense. In\nthat instance, the jury makes the finding: Did the defendant\u2019s\nconduct during the underlying crime create a substantial risk that\nviolent force would be used?In other words, as relevant here, a defendant\ncan fall within the scope of \u00a7924(c) either (1) because of the\nelements of the underlying crime or (2) because of the defendant\u2019s\nconduct in committing the underlying crime. Either (1) the judge\nfinds that an element of the underlying crime entails the use of\nphysical force or (2) the jury finds that the defendant\u2019s actual\nconduct involved a substantial risk that physical force may be\nused. Put another way, the underlying crime itself may\nautomatically bring the defendant within the scope of \u00a7924(c). Or\nif the underlying crime does not automatically qualify as a crime\nof violence, then the defendant\u2019s conduct during the crime may\nstill bring the defendant within the scope of \u00a7924(c). Sensible\nenough.The basic question in this case is whether the\nsubstantial-risk prong of \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of\nviolence\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. It is not.As this Court has explained multiple times,\ncriminal laws that apply a risk standard to a defendant\u2019s conduct\nare not too vague, but instead are perfectly constitutional.\nWriting for the Court inJohnson, for example, Justice\nScalia stated that \u201cwe do not doubt the constitutionality of laws\nthat call for the application of a qualitative standard such as\n\u2018substantial risk\u2019 to real-world conduct.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12). The following year inWelchv.United\nStates, Justice Kennedy confirmed thatJohnson\u201ccast no\ndoubt on the many laws that \u2018require gauging the riskiness of\nconduct in which an individual defendant engageson a particular\noccasion.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 3\u20134) (quotingJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12)). Two years later inDimaya, Justice Kagan wrote for\nthe Court and echoed Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy: \u201cInJohnson\u2019s words, \u2018we do not doubt\u2019 the constitutionality of\napplying \u00a716(b)\u2019s \u2018substantial risk [standard] to real-world\nconduct.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201311)\n(quotingJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12)).That kind of risk-based criminal statute is not\nonly constitutional, it is very common. As the Court has\nrecognized, \u201cdozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms\nlike \u2018substantial risk,\u2019 \u2018grave risk,\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable\nrisk,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and almost all of those statutes \u201crequire gauging the\nriskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engageson\na particular occasion.\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12). Indeed, the Government\u2019s brief inJohnsoncollected more than 200 state and federal statutes that imposed\ncriminal penalties for conduct that created a risk of injury to\nothers. App. to Supp. Brief for United States inJohnsonv.United States, O. T. 2014, No. 13\u20137120, pp.\u00a01a\u201399a.Take a few examples from federal law: It is a\nfederal crime to create \u201casubstantial riskof harm to human\nlife\u201d while illegally \u201cmanufacturing a controlled substance.\u201d 21\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7858 (emphasis added). Under certain\ncircumstances, it is a federal crime to create \u201casubstantial\nriskof serious bodily injury to any other person by destroying\nor damaging any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal\nproperty within the United States or by attempting or conspiring\nto\u201d do so. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72332b(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).\nAnd for purposes of the chapter of the federal criminal code\ndealing with sexual abuse crimes, \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is\ndefined as \u201cbodily injury that involves asubstantial riskof death, unconsciousness, extreme physical pain, protracted and\nobvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the\nfunction of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d \u00a72246(4)\n(emphasis added).The States\u2019 criminal codes are similar. Among\nthe crimes that the States define by using qualitative risk\nstandards are resisting arrest,[4] kidnaping,[5]\nassault,[6] battery,[7] criminal recklessness,[8] endangerment,[9] unlawful restraint,[10] theft,[11]\nhazing,[12] abuse,[13] neglect,[14] arson,[15] homicide,[16]\nand weapons offenses.[17]Consider a few specific examples: In\nPennsylvania, a person resists arrest \u201cif, with the intent of\npreventing a public servant from effecting a lawful arrest or\ndischarging any other duty, the person creates asubstantial\nriskof bodily injury to the public servant or anyone else.\u201d 18\nPa. Cons. Stat. \u00a75104 (2015) (emphasis added). In Tennessee,\nkidnaping is defined as false imprisonment \u201cunder circumstances\nexposing the other person tosubstantial riskof bodily\ninjury.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013303(a) (2018) (emphasis added). In\nNew York, reckless endangerment occurs when a person \u201crecklessly\nengages in conduct which creates asubstantial riskof\nserious physical injury to another person.\u201d N.\u00a0Y. Penal Law\nAnn. \u00a7120.20 (emphasis added). And in Maryland, neglect of a minor\nis defined as \u201cthe intentional failure to provide necessary\nassistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of\na minor that creates asubstantial riskof harm to the\nminor\u2019s physical health or asubstantial riskof mental\ninjury to the minor.\u201d Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013602.1(a)(5)(i)\n(2012) (emphasis added).The above examples demonstrate that\nsubstantial-risk standards like the one in \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) are a\ntraditional and common feature of criminal statutes. As the\nEleventh Circuit succinctly stated, there \u201cis nothing remarkable\nabout asking jurors to make that sort of risk determination\u2014and, if\nnecessary, requiring judges to instruct jurors on the meaning of\nterms like \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018physical force.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOvallesv.United States, 905 F.3d 1231, 1250,\nn.\u00a08 (2018) (en banc). That is \u201cexactly how similar questions\nhave been resolved for centuries and are resolved every day in\ncourts throughout the country.\u201dIbid.A statute is unconstitutionally vague only if\n\u201cit fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it\npunishes,\u201d or is \u201cso standardless that it invites arbitrary\nenforcement.\u201dJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). Section 924(c)(3)(B) is not unconstitutionally vague. To\nreiterate, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense\nthat is a felony and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that by its nature, involves a\nsubstantial risk that physical force against the person or property\nof another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d\nSection 924(c)(3)(B) affords people of ordinary intelligence ample\nnotice that they may be punished if they carry or use a gun while\nengaging in criminal conduct that presents a risk that physical\nforce may be used. There \u201cis a whole range of conduct that anyone\nwith at least a semblance of common sense would know\u201d is covered by\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B).Chicagov.Morales,527 U.S.\n41, 114 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and\njuries are well equipped to enforce and defend \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\nprosecutions in a principled and predictable way\u2014just as they have\nfor decades with many other substantial-risk criminal statutes. As\nJudge Niemeyer wrote in his separate opinion in the Fourth Circuit,\n\u201cthe parties in those cases had little difficulty understanding,\nenforcing, or defending the \u00a7924(c)(1) charges at issue.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 264 (2019).[18]In short, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is a garden-variety,\nsubstantial-risk criminal law. Section 924(c)(3)(B) is not\nunconstitutionally vague.IIThis case therefore should be straightforward.\nBut the Court complicates things by engaging in a two-step dance\nthat ends with the Court concluding that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is\nunconstitutionally vague.The Court\u2019s first step is to construe\n\u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s substantial-risk prong to require an ordinary-case\ncategorical approach rather than a conduct-specific approach. In\nother words, the Court says that a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence\nunder \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s substantial-risk prong hinges on a judge\u2019s\nassessment of how ahypothetical defendantwould ordinarily\ncommit the underlying crime. In the Court\u2019s view, a defendant\u2019s\nguilt or innocence under \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s substantial-risk prong does\nnot depend on a jury\u2019s finding about how theactual\ndefendantactually committed the underlying crime.The Court\u2019s second step is based on the Court\u2019s\ndecisions inJohnsonandDimaya. The Court says that\nthe ordinary-case categorical approach makes \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\nunconstitutionally vague.For purposes of this case, the Court\u2019s error is\nits first step\u2014that is, in construing the substantial-risk prong of\n\u00a7924(c)(3) to require an ordinary-case categorical approach. For\nthree reasons, I disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis. First, the\nCourt\u2019s justifications inJohnsonandDimayafor\nadopting the categorical approach do not apply in the context of\n\u00a7924(c). Second, the text of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on\nthe actual defendant\u2019s actual conduct during the underlying crime,\nnot on a hypothetical defendant\u2019s imagined conduct during an\nordinary case of the underlying crime. Third, even if the text were\nambiguous, the constitutional avoidance canon requires that we\ninterpret the statute to focus on the actual defendant\u2019s actual\nconduct.I will address those three points in Parts II\u2013A,\nII\u2013B, and II\u2013C.AAccording to the Court, if \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\nfocused on the defendant\u2019s conduct during the underlying crime,\nthen it wouldnotbe unconstitutionally vague. But\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B), as the Court reads it, focuses on a hypothetical\ndefendant\u2019s conduct during an ordinary case of the underlying\ncrime. As a result, the Court says that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)isunconstitutionally vague.But it makes little sense, as I see it, to say\nthat \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s substantial-risk inquiry focuses on whethera hypothetical defendant\u2019s imagined conductduring an\nordinary case of the crime creates a substantial risk that physical\nforce may be used, rather than on whetherthe actual defendant\u2019s\nactual conductduring the actual crime created a substantial\nrisk that physical force may be used. Why would we interpret a\nfederal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a\nhypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant? As\nJudge Newsom cogently wrote for the Eleventh Circuit en banc\nmajority, \u201cIf you were to ask John Q. Public whether a particular\ncrime posed a substantial risk of violence, surely he would\nrespond, \u2018Well, tell me how it went down\u2014what\nhappened?\u2019\u00a0\u201dOvalles, 905 F.\u00a03d, at\n1241.[19]Why does the Court read the substantial-risk\nprong in such an unnatural way? The Court explains thatJohnsoninterpreted similar substantial-risk language to\nrequire the ordinary-case categorical approach. See 576 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 12\u201313). A plurality of the Court did the\nsame inDimaya. See 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n12\u201315). And the Court today casts this case as the third\ninstallment in a trilogy with a predictable ending, one that was\nsupposedly foreordained byJohnsonandDimaya.The gaping hole in the Court\u2019s analysis, in my\nview, is thatJohnsonandDimayaaddressed statutes\nthat imposed penalties based on a defendant\u2019spriorcriminal\nconvictions.InJohnson, the Court interpreted a\ndefinition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d that was used in sentencing\nproceedings to classify prior convictions as predicates for\nstricter sentences. See \u00a7\u00a7924(e)(1), (e)(2)(B). InDimaya,\nthe Court interpreted a definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that was\nused in immigration proceedings to classify prior convictions as\npredicates for more severe immigration consequences. See \u00a716\n(defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d); 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(F) (incorporating 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716); 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (deportation);\n\u00a7\u00a71229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C) (ineligibility for cancellation of removal\nand adjustment of status).In interpreting those statutes, the Court\nemployed the ordinary-case categorical approach to assess an\nindividual\u2019spastconvictions. And application of that\ncategorical approach, the Court then said, rendered the statutes at\nissue in those cases unconstitutionally vague. SeeDimaya,\n584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 9\u201311);Johnson, 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).[20]Two important principles drove the Court\u2019s\nadoption of the categorical approach in theprior-conviction\ncontext inJohnsonandDimaya.First, in the prior-conviction cases, the\nCourt emphasized that the categorical approach avoids the\ndifficulties and inequities of relitigating \u201cpast convictions in\nminitrials conducted long after the fact.\u201dMoncrieffev.Holder,569 U.S.\n184, 200\u2013201 (2013). Without the categorical approach, courts\nwould have to determine the underlying conduct from years-old or\neven decades-old documents with varying levels of factual detail.\nSeeTaylorv.United States,495\nU.S. 575, 601\u2013602 (1990). The factual statements that are\ncontained in those documents are often \u201cprone to error.\u201dMathisv.United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2016) (slip op., at 10). The categorical approach avoids the\nunfairness of allowing inaccuracies to \u201ccome back to haunt the\ndefendant many years down the road.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11). The Court has echoed that reasoning time and again. See,e.g.,Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 15);Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13);Descampsv.United States, 570\nU.S. 254, 270 (2013);Chambersv.United States,555 U.S.\n122, 125 (2009).Second, in the prior-conviction cases,\nthe Court insisted on the categorical approach to avoid \u201c Sixth\nAmendment concerns.\u201dDescamps, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 269. The\nSixth Amendment, as interpreted by this Court\u2019s precedents, does\nnot allow a judge (rather than a jury) to make factual\ndeterminations that increase the maximum penalty. SeeApprendiv.New Jersey,530 U.S.\n466, 490 (2000). The Court has read its Sixth Amendment\nprecedents to require the categorical approach. Under the\ncategorical approach, the judge looks only to the fact of\nconviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. The\nCourt has reiterated those Sixth Amendment concerns in countless\ncategorical-approach cases. See,e.g.,Dimaya, 584\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13);Mathis, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10);Shepardv.United States,544 U.S.\n13, 24\u201325 (2005) (plurality opinion);Taylor, 495\nU.\u00a0S., at 601.In short, the Court inJohnsonandDimayaemployed something akin to the constitutional\navoidance doctrine to read the statutes at issue to avoid practical\nand Sixth Amendment problems. In the words of Justice Thomas, the\n\u201ccategorical approach was never really about the best reading of\nthe text.\u201dDimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (dissenting\nopinion) (slip op., at 28). As Judge Raggi has perceptively stated:\n\u201c[C]onstitutional avoidance informed the original\ncategorical-approach mandate.\u201dUnited Statesv.Barrett, 903 F.3d 166, 179 (CA2 2018).But neither of the two reasons identified inJohnsonandDimayaapplies to 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\u2014not even a little.First, \u00a7924(c) does not require\nexamination of old conduct underlying apriorconviction.\nSection 924(c) operates entirely in the present. In a \u00a7924(c)\nprosecution, there are ordinarily two charged crimes: the\nunderlying crime and the \u00a7924(c) offense. Here, for example, the\ndefendants were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and with\nthe \u00a7924(c) offense. The defendant\u2019s conduct during the underlying\ncrime is part of the \u00a7924(c) offense. The conduct charged in the\n\u00a7924(c) offense is in front of the jury (if the case goes to trial)\nor accepted by the defendant in the plea agreement (if the\ndefendant pleads guilty). The indictment must allege specific\noffense conduct, and that conduct must be proved with real-world\nfacts in order to obtain a conviction. There is no need to worry\nabout stale evidence or unavailable witnesses. Nor is there any\nneed to worry about inaccuracies in years-old or decades-old\ndocuments coming back to haunt the defendant.Second, \u00a7924(c) likewise raises no Sixth\nAmendment concerns. A jury will find the facts or, if the case ends\nin a guilty plea, the defendant will accept the facts in the plea\nagreement. For the \u00a7924(c) charge, as relevant here, a jury must\nfind that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cby its nature, involves a\nsubstantial risk that physical force against the person or property\nof another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d\nThe defendant has the opportunity to contest the relevant facts\neither at the trial or in plea negotiations. No Sixth Amendment\nissue arises in a \u00a7924(c) prosecution.No practical or Sixth Amendment problems exist\nwith \u00a7924(c)(3)(B). Indeed, the Court itself acknowledges that \u201ca\ncase-specific approach wouldn\u2019t yield the same practical and Sixth\nAmendment complications\u201d that arose inJohnsonandDimaya.Ante, at 8.We should recognize thatJohnsonandDimayadealt with an entirely different context:priorconvictions. There is no need to followJohnsonandDimayaoff the cliff here. We should read \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\nlike the dozens of other substantial-risk statutes in federal and\nstate criminal law: to focus on the actual defendant\u2019s actual\nconduct during the actual underlying crime, not on a hypothetical\ndefendant\u2019s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of that\ncrime.BNow to the statutory text of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B).\nEven though the context here is current-offense conduct, not past\nconvictions, the Court says that the statutory language nonetheless\ncompels a focus on a hypothetical defendant\u2019s imagined conduct, not\non the actual defendant\u2019s actual conduct. I disagree. Criminal\ndefendants are usually punished based on what they actually did,\nnot based on what a hypothetical defendant might have done.To begin with, the text of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) must be\ninterpreted against the backdrop of traditional criminal-law\npractice. As described above, substantial-risk statutes are\ncommonplace in federal and state criminal law. Those statutes\nordinarily call for examination of the actual defendant\u2019s actual\nconduct during the actual crime. The Court does not identify a\nsingle self-contained federal or state law that defines theactusreusof the crime based on the imagination of\nthe judge about a hypothetical defendant, rather than on the\nevidence before the jury about the actual defendant.This Court applied an exception inJohnsonandDimayafor substantial-risk statutes that\nimpose sentencing and other penalties based onpastconvictions. But that is an exception for past convictions, not a\nrule for current-offense conduct. Section 924(c)(3)(B) must be read\nin line with the traditional, common practice of focusing on the\nactual defendant\u2019s actual conduct during the underlying crime.With that background, I turn to the precise text\nof \u00a7924(c)(3). To repeat, the text of \u00a7924(c)(3) provides: A\ndefendant may not use or carry a firearm during and in relation to,\nor possess a firearm in furtherance of, \u201can offense that is a\nfelony and\u201d that either (A) \u201chas as an element the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another,\u201d or (B) \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial\nrisk that physical force against the person or property of another\nmay be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201dI will focus on four particular aspects of the\nstatutory text of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B).First, start with the term \u201coffense.\u201d\nSection 924(c)(3) has two prongs under which a defendant might\nqualify for a \u00a7924(c) conviction: first, if the underlying crime\nautomatically qualifies as a crime of violence based on its\nelements; and, second, if the defendant\u2019s conduct during the\nunderlying crime created a substantial risk that physical force may\nbe used, even if the underlying crime by its elements does not\nconstitute a crime of violence.The term \u201coffense\u201d applies to both prongs. In\nthe elements prong, the term refers to the elements of the\nunderlying crime. In the substantial-risk prong, the term refers to\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct during the underlying crime. That is\nentirely commonplace and sensible.Reading \u201coffense\u201d in that commonsense way\nfollows from the Court\u2019s precedents interpreting the term\n\u201coffense.\u201d As the Court has explained many times, the term\n\u201coffense\u201d may \u201csometimes refer to a generic crime\u201d and may\n\u201csometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged\non a specific occasion.\u201dNijhawanv.Holder,557 U.S.\n29, 33\u201334 (2009).[21]\nIndeed, the single term \u201coffense\u201d can refer to both in the same\nstatutory scheme. See,e.g.,id., at 40;id.,\nat 38 (listing other examples);United Statesv.Hayes,555 U.S.\n415, 421\u2013422 (2009).InUnited Statesv.Hayes, for\nexample, the Court interpreted the term \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence.\u201d That term was defined as \u201can offense\u201d that (1)\n\u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or\nthe threatened use of a deadly weapon,\u201d and (2) was \u201ccommitted by\u201d\na person who has a particular relationship with the victim.\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A). The Court interpreted the \u201coffense that\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. has, as an element\u201d language in that provision to\nfocus on the legal prohibition, and interpreted the \u201coffense\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. committed by\u201d language to focus on the defendant\u2019s\nconduct. SeeHayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 421\u2013422. In other\nwords, the term \u201coffense\u201d was used once but had two different\nmeanings as applied to the two different parts of the statutory\nprovision.Another example is the Immigration and\nNationality Act. That statute defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d in part\nas \u201can offense\u201d (1) that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit\u201d and (2) \u201cin\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i). The Court interpreted the\n\u201coffense that .\u00a0.\u00a0. involves fraud or deceit\u201d language to\nfocus on the legal prohibition. SeeKawashimav.Holder,565 U.S.\n478, 483 (2012). And the Court interpreted the \u201coffense\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in which the loss\u201d language to focus on the\nindividual\u2019s conduct. SeeNijhawan, 557 U.\u00a0S., at 40.\nAgain, the term \u201coffense\u201d was used once, but had two different\nmeanings as applied to the two different parts of the statutory\nprovision.Section 924(c)(3) is the same kind of statutory\nprovision. It likewise encompasses both the legal prohibition (in\nsubpart (A)) and the defendant\u2019s actual conduct (in subpart (B)).\nThe term \u201coffense\u201d was read inHayes,Kawashima, andNijhawanto encompass both the legal prohibition and the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct. The term should be read that same way\nhere.Moreover, if the substantial-risk prong of\n\u00a7924(c)(3) requires assessing a hypothetical defendant\u2019s conduct\nrather than the actual defendant\u2019s conduct, then there would be\nlittle daylight between the elements prong and the substantial-risk\nprong. After all, a crime is defined by its elements. The elements\ntell you what happens in an ordinary case of a crime. To imagine\nhow a hypothetical defendant would have committed an ordinary case\nof the crime, you would presumably look back to the elements of the\ncrime. But doing that under the substantial-risk prong\u2014as the Court\nwould do\u2014would just duplicate the inquiry that already occurs under\nthe elements prong. That would defeat Congress\u2019 purpose in adding\nthe substantial-risk prong to \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2014namely, covering\ndefendants who committed crimes that are not violent by definition\nbut that are committed by particular defendants in ways that create\na risk of violence. There is no reason to think that Congress meant\nto duplicate the elements prong in the substantial-risk\nprong.[22]The Court usually tries to avoid an\ninterpretation of a statutory provision that would make the\nprovision redundant and accomplish virtually nothing. See,e.g.,Republic of Sudanv.Harrison, 587\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 10);Dastar Corp.v.Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,539 U.S.\n23, 35 (2003);Mackeyv.Lanier Collection Agency\n& Service,Inc.,486 U.S.\n825, 837 (1988); A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 174\u2013179 (2012); W. Eskridge,\nInterpreting Law: A Primer on How to Read Statutes and the\nConstitution 112\u2013114 (2016). We should heed that principle here,\nand recognize that the term \u201coffense\u201d in the substantial-risk prong\nrefers to the actual defendant\u2019s conduct during the underlying\ncrime.In short, the term \u201coffense\u201d in \u00a7924(c)(3), as\napplied to the substantial-risk prong, focuses on the actual\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct, not on a hypothetical defendant\u2019s\nimagined conduct.Second, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the\ndefendant\u2019s offense \u201cby its nature\u201d involves a risk that physical\nforce may be used. In a vacuum, the \u201cnature\u201d of an offense could be\neither \u201cthe metaphysical \u2018nature\u2019 of the offense\u201d or \u201cthe\nunderlying facts of the offense.\u201dDimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 24). But that is because\nthe term \u201coffense\u201d could refer to a legal prohibition or to the\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct. As explained above, however, the term\n\u201coffense\u201d as applied to the substantial-risk prong refers to the\nactual defendant\u2019s con- duct during the underlying crime. It\nfollows that \u201cby its na- ture\u201d focuses on the nature of the actual\ndefendant\u2019s conduct during the crime. The phrase \u201cby its nature\u201d is\nlinked to the term \u201coffense.\u201d If the term \u201coffense\u201d refers to the\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct, then \u201cby its nature\u201d also focuses on\nthe defendant\u2019s actual conduct.Under the conduct-specific approach to the\nsubstantial-risk prong, the \u201cby its nature\u201d language simply means\nthat the Government has to show more than a defendant\u2019s proclivity\nfor crime and more than the mere fact that the defendant was\ncarrying a gun. The Government has to show that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct by its natureduring the crimecreated a substantial\nrisk that physical force may be used.In short, as Justice Thomas has pointed out, it\n\u201cis entirely natural to use words like \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018offense\u2019 to\nrefer to an offender\u2019s actual underlying conduct.\u201dIbid.So\nit is here.Third, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct \u201cinvolves\u201d a substantial risk that physical\nforce may be used. InTaylorv.United States, a case\ninvolving a prior-conviction statutory provision, the Court pointed\nto theabsenceof the word \u201cinvolved\u201d in adopting a\ncategorical approach. 495 U.\u00a0S., at 600. And inNijhawanv.Holder, another case involving a\nprior-conviction statutory provision, the Court explained that the\nword \u201cinvolves\u201d did not support a categorical approach. 557\nU.\u00a0S., at 36. Here, unlike inTaylor, the statute does\nuse the word \u201cinvolves.\u201d UnderTaylor\u2019s reasoning, the\ninclusion of the word \u201cinvolves\u201d in \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) supports the\nconclusion that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) employs a conduct-specific approach\nrather than a categorical approach.Fourth, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s use of the phrase\n\u201cin the course of committing the offense\u201d indicates that the proper\nfocus is on the actual defendant\u2019s actual conduct, not on a\nhypothetical defendant\u2019s imagined conduct. After all, the\nunderlying offense was committed by the actual defendant, not by a\nhypothetical defendant. It strains common sense to think that the\n\u201cin the course of committing the offense\u201d language in \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\ncontemplates an inquiry into a hypothetical defendant\u2019s conduct\nduring an ordinary case of the crime.Importantly, the law at issue inJohnsondid not have the \u201cin the course of committing the offense\u201d\nlanguage. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That is a major textual difference\nbetween the law inJohnsonon the one hand and \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\non the other hand. And that textual distinction further shows that\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual defendant\u2019s actual conduct.In short, those four textual indicators, while\nnot all entirely one-sided, together strongly suggest that\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual defendant\u2019s actual conduct\nduring the actual crime, not on a hypothetical defendant\u2019s imagined\nconduct during an ordinary case of the crime.On top of all the language in the statute,\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B) doesnotcontain the critical term that\nordinarily marks a categorical approach.Section 924(c)(3)(B) does not use the term\n\u201cconviction.\u201d This Court has historically recognized the term\n\u201cconviction\u201d as a key textual driver of the categorical approach.\nIn cases such asTaylorandJohnson, the Court zeroed\nin on the word \u201cconvictions.\u201d SeeJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 13);Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 600;\nsee alsoMathis, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9);Moncrieffe, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 191;Ovalles, 905\nF.\u00a03d, at 1245. So too, the Court inLeocalv.Ashcroftemphasized that the text of the INA that\nincorporated \u00a716(b) used the term \u201cconvicted.\u201d543 U.S.\n1, 4, 7 (2004).[23]The term \u201cconviction\u201d is nowhere to be found in\nthe text of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B). That should not come as a surprise,\ngiven that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is a substantive criminal offense\nconcerned with the defendant\u2019s current-offense conduct. The absence\nof the term \u201cconviction\u201d in \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) strongly supports a\nconduct-specific approach.Put simply, the textual clues\u2014both the words\nthat are used and the words that are not used\u2014point strongly to the\nconclusion that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) requires a jury to assess the actual\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct during the underlying crime. The\nconclusion becomes overwhelming when considered against the general\nbackground of substantial-risk statutes. To be sure, a statute can\nalways be written more clearly. But here, the textual toolkit leads\ndecisively to that conclusion.CBut after all of that, suppose that you are\nnot convinced. Suppose that you think that this case is still a\nclose call on the text, even with the background of\nsubstantial-risk statutes and the Court\u2019s precedents. Indeed,\nsuppose you ultimately disagree with the above analysis of the\ntext. Even so, the Government still wins\u2014unless it can be said that\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B)unambiguouslyrequires a categorical approach.\nUnder the constitutional avoidance canon, the precise question\nbefore us is not whether \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is best read to require a\nconduct-specific approach, but rather (as the Court\u2019s cases say)\nwhether \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) can reasonably, plausibly, or fairly possibly\nbe interpreted to require a conduct-specific approach. The answer\nto that question is easy. Yes. SeeHooperv.California,155 U.S.\n648, 657 (1895) (\u201creasonable\u201d);Clarkv.Martinez,543 U.S.\n371, 380 (2005) (\u201cplausible\u201d);Skillingv.United\nStates,561 U.S.\n358, 406 (2010) (\u201cfairly possible\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).The Court says that if \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) requires\nthe categorical approach, then it is unconstitutionally vague. But\nthe Court also says that if \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct, then it is constitutionally\npermissible. As the Court puts it, \u201ca case-specific approach would\navoid the vagueness problems that doomed the statutes inJohnsonandDimaya.\u201dAnte, at 8. So the entire\nball game is whether it is fairly possible to interpret\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B) to require a conduct-specific approach. It surely is\nat least fairly possible.It is an elementary principle of statutory\ninterpretation that an ambiguous statute must be interpreted,\nwhenever possible, to avoid unconstitutionality. See generally\nScalia, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, at 247\u2013251;\nEskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How to Read Statutes and\nthe Constitution, at 317\u2013322. That uncontroversial principle of\nstatutory interpretation dates back to the Founding era. SeeMossmanv.Higginson, 4 Dall. 12, 14 (1800). As\nJustice Thomas has explained, the traditional doctrine of\nconstitutional avoidance commands \u201ccourts, when faced with two\nplausible constructions of a statute\u2014one constitutional and the\nother unconstitutional\u2014to choose the constitutional reading.\u201dClark, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 395 (dissenting opinion). This\nCourt\u2019s duty is \u201cnot to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe\nit, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with\nconstitutional limitations.\u201dCivil Service Comm\u2019nv.Letter Carriers,413 U.S.\n548, 571 (1973). In discharging that duty, \u201cevery reasonable\nconstruction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from\nunconstitutionality.\u201dHooper, 155 U.\u00a0S., at 657.This Court\u2019s longstanding practice of saving\nambiguous statutes from unconstitutionality where fairly possible\naffords proper respect for the representative branches of our\nGovernment. The Court has explained that \u201ca presumption never ought\nto be indulged, that congress meant to exercise or usurp any\nunconstitutional authority, unless that conclusion is forced upon\nthe Court by language altogether unambiguous.\u201dUnited Statesv.Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 76 (1838).In countless cases for more than 200 years, this\nCourt has recognized the principle that courts should construe\nambiguous laws to be consistent with the Constitution.

This is a case of\navoidingactualunconstitutionality. There is a debate about\nthe former practice. There is no real debate about the latter rule.\nAnd it is the latter rule of statutory interpretation at issue\nhere.Section 924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on\nthe defendant\u2019s actual conduct. But at a minimum\u2014given the text,\nthe background of substantial-risk laws, and the relevant\nprecedents\u2014it is fairly possible to interpret \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) to\nfocus on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct. Because that reasonable\ninterpretation would save \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) from unconstitutionality,\nthis case should be very straightforward, as Judge Newsom explained\nin his thorough majority opinion in the Eleventh Circuit and as\nJudge Niemeyer and Judge Richardson explained in their persuasive\nseparate opinions in the Fourth Circuit.Ovalles, 905\nF.\u00a03d, at 1251;Simms, 914 F.\u00a03d, at 272 (opinion\nof Niemeyer, J.);id., at 272\u2013277 (opinion of Richardson,\nJ.). We should prefer the constitutional reading over the\nunconstitutional reading.The Court did not apply constitutional avoidance\ninJohnsonandDimaya. Why not? In those two cases,\nthe Court explained, the canon of constitutional avoidance was\nessentially rendered a nullity. That is because, as the Court\ndescribed the situation, the Court was between a rock and a hard\nplace. The categorical approach would have led to Fifth Amendment\nvagueness concerns, whereas applying the conduct-specific approach\nwould have led to Sixth Amendment jury-trial concerns. SeeDimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (plurality opinion) (slip\nop., at 13\u201314).Here, by contrast, the Court is not between a\nrock and a hard place. Applying the categorical approach to\n\u00a7924(c)(3)(B) would lead to vagueness concerns, whereas applying\nthe conduct-specific approach would lead to no constitutional\nconcerns.Faced with a choice between a rock and\nconstitutionality, the Court chooses the rock. I do not understand\nthat choice.The Court offers two related reasons for its\nchoice to run the statute into a rock. Neither reason holds up.First, the Court concludes that the\nconstitutional avoidance canon must yield to the rule of lenity.\nThat argument disregards the Court\u2019s oft-repeated statements that\nthe rule of lenity is a tool of last resort that applies \u201conly\nwhen, after consulting traditional canons of statutory\nconstruction,\u201d grievous ambiguity remains.Hayes, 555\nU.\u00a0S., at 429 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also,e.g.,Ocasiov.United States, 578 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___, n.\u00a08 (2016) (slip op., at 13, n.\u00a08) (\u201cafter\nseizing everything from which aid can be derived\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted));Muscarellov.United\nStates,524 U.S.\n125, 138 (1998) (same);United Statesv.Wells,519 U.S.\n482, 499 (1997) (same);Renov.Koray,515 U.S.\n50, 65 (1995) (same);United Statesv.Shabani,513 U.S.\n10, 17 (1994) (\u201cafter consulting traditional canons of\nstatutory construction\u201d);Smithv.United States,508 U.S.\n223, 239 (1993) (\u201cafter seizing every thing from which aid can\nbe derived\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted));Moskalv.United States,498\nU.S. 103, 108 (1990) (\u201cafterresort to the language and\nstructure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the\nstatute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Callananv.United States,364 U.S.\n587, 596 (1961) (\u201cat the end of the process of construing what\nCongress has expressed\u201d).The constitutional avoidance canon is a\ntraditional canon of statutory interpretation. The constitutional\navoidance canon is employed to reach a reasonable interpretation of\nan ambiguous statute. Where, as here, that canon applies and yields\nsuch a reasonable interpretation, no grievous ambiguity remains.\nThe rule of lenity has no role to play. Contrary to the Court\u2019s\nassertion, the canon of constitutional avoidance is not \u201cat war\u201d\nwith the rule of lenity.Ante, at 19. The canon of\nconstitutional avoidance precedes the rule of lenity because the\nrule of lenity comes into play (this Court has said countless\ntimes) only \u201cafterconsulting traditional canons of\nstatutory construction.\u201dHayes, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 429\n(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). The rule of\nlenity \u201ccomes into operation at the end of the process of\nconstruing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an\noverriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\u201dCallanan, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 596.In addition, the rule of lenity is triggered\nonly in the face of \u201cgrievous ambiguity.\u201dMuscarello, 524\nU.\u00a0S., at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted). To\nreiterate, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the actual\ndefendant\u2019s actual conduct. But to the extent that there is any\nambiguity in \u00a7924(c)(3)(B), that ambiguity is far from\ngrievous.Second, and relatedly, the Court claims\nthat the canon of constitutional avoidance, as a general matter,\ncannot be relied upon to broaden the scope of a criminal statute,\nas opposed to narrowing the scope of a criminal statute. And the\nCourt says that the canon cannot be used here because, in the\nCourt\u2019s view, relying on the constitutional avoidance canon in this\ncase would expand the scope of \u00a7924(c)(3)(B). I disagree for two\nindependent reasons.To begin with, that theory seems to come out of\nnowhere. The Court\u2019s novel cabining of the constitutional avoidance\ncanon is not reflected in this Court\u2019s precedents. On the contrary,\nit contradicts several precedents. This Court has applied the\nconstitutional avoidance canon even when avoiding the\nconstitutional problems would have broadened the statute\u2019s scope.\nFor example, inUnited Statesv.Culbert, this Court\nrejected a narrowing construction of the Hobbs Act because that\nconstruction would have raised vagueness concerns.435 U.S.\n371, 374 (1978); see alsoUnited Statesv.Shreveport\nGrain & Elevator Co.,287 U.S.\n77, 82 (1932); cf.United Statesv.Grace,461 U.S.\n171, 176 (1983).Moreover, the premise of this novel broadening/\nnarrowing theory is flawed. A categorical approach to \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)\nwould not be inherently narrower than a conduct-specific approach.\nEach approach would sweep in some crimes that the other would not.\nOn the one hand, some crimes that might be deemed categorically\nviolent sometimes may be committed in nonviolent ways. Those crimes\nwould be covered by the categorical approach but not by a\nconduct-specific approach. On the other hand, some categorically\nnonviolent crimes are committed in violent ways. Those crimes would\nnot be covered by the categorical approach but would be covered by\na conduct-specific approach. SeeJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).In sum, the constitutional avoidance canon makes\nthis an especially straightforward case. It is at least fairly\npossible to read \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) to focus on the actual defendant\u2019s\nactual conduct during the actual crime. End of case.IIIThe consequences of the Court\u2019s decision today\nwill be severe. By invalidating the substantial-risk prong of\n\u00a7924(c)(3), the Court\u2019s decision will thwart Congress\u2019 law\nenforcement policies, destabilize the criminal justice system, and\nundermine safety in American communities. If the law required those\nresults, we would have to swallow the consequences. But the law, in\nmy respectful view, does no such thing.The Court\u2019s decision means that people who in\nthe future commit violent crimes with firearms may be able to\nescape conviction under \u00a7924(c). In enacting \u00a7924(c), Congress\nsought to keep firearms away from violent criminal situations.\nToday, the Court invalidates a critical provision designed to\nachieve that goal. To be sure, many violent crimes still might fall\nwithin \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. But many others might not.\nWhen defendants use firearms during conspiracies to commit robbery,\narsons, attempted carjackings, and kidnapings, to name just a few,\nthey might no longer be subject to prosecution under \u00a7924(c). See,e.g.,Simms, 914 F.\u00a03d, at 233\u2013234 (conspiracy\nto commit robbery);United Statesv.Salas, 889 F.3d\n681, 683\u2013684 (CA10 2018) (arson);United Statesv.Jenkins, 849 F.3d 390, 393 (CA7 2017) (kidnaping).To get a flavor of the offenders who will now\npotentially avoid conviction under \u00a7924(c), consider a sample of\nthose offenders who have been convicted under \u00a7924(c)(3)\u2019s\nsubstantial-risk prong:One defendant committed assault with intent to\ncommit murder. The defendant shot his wife multiple times while the\ncouple was camping in Buffalo River National Park. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Prickett, 839 F.3d 697, 698 (CA8 2016).One defendant committed arson. The defendant\nused a molotov cocktail to firebomb the Irish Ink Tattoo Shop. SeeSalas, 889 F.\u00a03d, at 683;United Statesv.Salazar, 2014 WL 12788997, *1 (NM, Aug. 14, 2014).One defendant and others kidnaped a man who they\nbelieved had stolen money and an Xbox from the defendant. They beat\nthe man severely and threatened to kill him. See Pet. for Cert. inUnited Statesv.Jenkins, O. T. 2017, No. 17\u201397,\np.\u00a02.One defendant committed conspiracy to commit\nrobbery. The defendant and his co-conspirators planned to steal\nPercocet and cash from a man they thought was a drug dealer. Armed\nwith a pistol and a crowbar, they broke into the man\u2019s home by\nshattering a sliding glass door and found three men there. One of\nthe defendant\u2019s co-conspirators attacked all three men with the\ncrowbar, and the defendant threatened the men with a pistol\nmultiple times. SeeUnited Statesv.Douglas, 907\nF.3d 1, 4\u20135 (CA1 2018).One defendant committed attempted carjacking.\nArmed with guns and baseball bats, the defendant and her\nco-conspirators robbed a grocery store and carjacked two vehicles,\npistol whipping the owner of one of the vehicles in the process.\nThey then attempted to carjack a third vehicle. They approached a\nfamily getting out of a minivan and demanded the keys. One of the\ndefendant\u2019s co-conspirators hit a 13-year-old girl in the mouth\nwith a baseball bat. Another shot an AK\u201347 at the girl\u2019s family.\nSeeOvalles, 905 F.\u00a03d, at 1235.One defendant operated multiple houses of\nprostitution in Annapolis. The defendant threatened perceived\ncompetitors with violence. He also beat and threatened women,\nsometimes to compel them to engage in prostitution. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Fuertes, 805 F.3d 485, 490\u2013492 (CA4 2015).One defendant committed conspiracy to commit\nrobbery. In the middle of the night, the defendant and a\nco-conspirator crawled into a McDonald\u2019s through the drive-through\nwindow. The defendant pointed a gun at the restaurant\u2019s manager and\nattempted to hit another employee. The defendant demanded money,\nand the manager complied. The defendant then removed the money from\nthe cash drawer, pistol whipped the manager, threw the cash drawer\nat the other employee, and fled the scene along with his\nco-conspirators and $1,100. SeeSimms, 914 F.\u00a03d, at\n232.One defendant committed conspiracy to commit\nrobbery. The defendant and his co-conspirators committed a string\nof armed robberies of small businesses. During the robberies, they\nwore masks and gloves. They were armed with guns, knives, and\nbaseball bats. They injured several people during the course of\ntheir robberies, breaking bones, drawing blood, and knocking people\nout. They also shot and killed one of their victims point blank.\nSeeBarrett, 903 F.\u00a03d, at 170, 184.Those real-life stories highlight a second\nunfortunate consequence of the Court\u2019s decision. Many offenders who\nhave already committed violent crimes with firearms\u2014and who have\nalready been convicted under \u00a7924(c)\u2014may be released early from\nprison. The Court\u2019s decision will apply to all defendants whose\nconvictions are not yet final on direct review and who preserved\nthe argument. With the benefit of this Court\u2019s decision, many\ndangerous offenders who received lengthy prison sentences as a\nresult of their violent conduct might walk out of prison early. And\nwho knows whether the ruling will be retroactive? Courts will be\ninundated with collateral-review petitions from some of the most\ndangerous federal offenders in America. As Judge Niemeyer wrote in\nhis separate opinion in the Fourth Circuit, \u201cthousands of\n\u00a7924(c)(1) convictions will unnecessarily be challenged as premised\non what the majority today concludes is an unconstitutionally vague\nprovision, even though the parties in those cases had little\ndifficulty understanding, enforcing, or defending the \u00a7924(c)(1)\ncharges at issue.\u201dSimms, 914 F.\u00a03d, at 264.Moreover, defendants who successfully challenge\ntheir \u00a7924(c) convictions will not merely be resentenced. Rather,\ntheir \u00a7924(c) convictions will be thrown out altogether. That is\nbecause, to restate an obvious point, \u00a7924(c) defines a substantive\ncriminal offense. To be sure, the \u00a7924(c) defendants may also be\nserving other sentences for other convictions (for instance, if\nthey were convicted of and sentenced for the underlying crime of\nviolence). But with the benefit of the Court\u2019s decision, they may\nbe able to get their \u00a7924(c) convictions tossed and lop off\nyears\u2014potentially decades\u2014from their total prison time.All because the Court thinks that \u00a7924(c)(3)(B)unambiguouslycompels a focus on the imagined conduct of a\nhypothetical defendant rather than on the actual conduct of the\nactual defendant. That analysis is not persuasive, especially in\nlight of the constitutional avoidance doctrine. It is true that the\nGovernment once advocated for a categorical approach. But in the\nearly years after Congress added a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition\nto \u00a7924(c), before courts settled on a categorical approach, the\nGovernment correctly argued for a conduct-specific approach to the\nsubstantial-risk prong. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Cruz, 805 F.2d 1464, 1469 (CA11 1986). The Government later\nchanged its tune only after the courts settled on a categorical\napproach\u2014at a time when it did not matter for constitutional\nvagueness purposes, beforeJohnsonandDimaya. In any\nevent, the question is what to do now afterJohnsonandDimaya. The answer should not be hard. To quote Judge\nWilliam Pryor, writing for five judges in the Eleventh Circuit, how\n\u201cdid we ever reach the point where\u201d we \u201cmust debate whether a\ncarjacking in which an assailant struck a 13-year-old girl in the\nmouth with a baseball bat and a cohort fired an AK\u201347 at her family\nis a crime of violence? It\u2019s nuts.\u201dOvalles, 905 F.\u00a03d,\nat 1253 (concurring opinion).To be sure, the consequences cannot change our\nunderstanding of the law. But when the consequences are this bad,\nit is useful to double-check the work. And double-checking here, in\nmy view, reveals several problems: relying on cases from the\nprior-conviction context whose rationales do not apply in this\ncurrent-offense context; not fully accounting for the long\ntradition of substantial-risk criminal statutes; not reading the\nwords of the statute in context and consistent with precedents such\nasHayes; and then, perhaps most problematically,\nmisapplying the longstanding constitutional avoidance canon. After\ndouble-checking, it should be evident that the law does not compel\nthose serious consequences. I am not persuaded that the Court can\nblame this decision on Congress. The Court has a way out, if it\nwants a way out.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court usually reads statutes with a\npresumption of rationality and a presumption of constitutionality.\nInstead of reading \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) to ensure that it is\nconstitutional, the Court reads \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) in a way that makes\nit unconstitutional. The bedrock principle that the Court\ninterprets ambiguous statutes to avoid unconstitutionality is\nseemingly transformed into a principle of interpreting ambiguous\nstatutes to lead to unconstitutionality.I respect and entirely understand how the Court\ngot here.JohnsonandDimayawere earth-rattling\ndecisions. But we should not followJohnsonandDimayaoff the constitutional cliff in this different\n\u00a7924(c) context. Unlike the statutes at issue inJohnsonandDimaya, this statute is not a prior-conviction statute. This\nstatute operates entirely in the present and is not remotely vague.\nI respectfully dissent.Notes1The statistics contained\nin the introduction are drawn from: Dept. of Justice, Federal\nBureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports 6\u20137, 8\u20139 (1963)\n(rise in violent crime with firearms in the 1960s);id., at\n1, 6\u20137, 9 (1968) (same); Pew Research Center, Gun Homicide Rate\nDown 49% Since 1993 Peak; Public Unaware 6, n.\u00a05, and 36, 50\n(2013) (decrease in violent crime with firearms over about the past\n25 years); N.

SeeSessionsv.Dimaya, 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13);Johnsonv.United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2015) (slip op., at 13). In this case, the Government strenuously\ndisputes the applicability of the categorical approach precisely\nbecause the inquiry is not about past convictions.21More\ngenerally, this Court has often said that \u201cidentical language may\nconvey varying content\u201d in the same statute, based on context.Yatesv.United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015)\n(plurality opinion); see alsoUtility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 319\u2013320 (2014).22This\nduplication point is icing on a textual cake already frosted. In\nother words, our interpretation of the term \u201coffense\u201d is informed\nby the text and by our precedents. Our interpretation stands with\nor without the duplication argument.23InLeocal, the Court interpreted \u00a716(b) to require a\ncategorical approach. But unlike \u00a7924(c)(3)(B), that statutory\nprovision applied in the context of past convictions. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7217(a), 98Stat. 2021; Comprehensive Crime\nControl Act of 1984, \u00a71202, 98Stat. 2151. To be sure, \u00a716(b) was\nonce incorporated into \u00a7924(c). But in 1986, Congress severed the\ntwo provisions and included a standalone \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\ndefinition in \u00a7924(c). For those two reasons, \u00a7924(c)(3)(B) need\nnot and should not be interpreted in the same way as\n\u00a716(b).",
