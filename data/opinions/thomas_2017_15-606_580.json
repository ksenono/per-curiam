    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 15\u2013606_________________MIGUEL ANGEL PENA-RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONERv.COLORADOon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ncolorado[March 6, 2017]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The Court today holds that the Sixth Amendment\nrequires the States to provide a criminal defendant the opportunity\nto impeach a jury\u2019s guilty verdict with juror testimony about a\njuror\u2019s alleged racial bias, notwithstanding a state procedural\nrule forbidding such testi-mony. I agree with Justice Alito that\nthe Court\u2019s decision is incompatible with the text of the Amendment\nit purports to interpret and with our precedents. I write\nseparately to explain that the Court\u2019s holding also cannot be\nsquared with the original understanding of the Sixth or Fourteenth\nAmendments.IThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection of the right,\n\u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\u201d to a \u201ctrial, by an impartial\njury,\u201d is limited to the protections that existed at common law\nwhen the Amendment was ratified. See,e.g.,Apprendiv.New Jersey, 530 U.\u00a0S. 466 , and n.\u00a01 (2000)\n(Thomas, J., concurring); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States \u00a71773, pp. 652\u2013653 (1833) (Story)\n(explaining that \u201cthe trial by jury in criminal cases\u201d protected by\nthe Constitution is the same \u201cgreat privilege\u201d that was \u201ca part of\nthat admirable common law\u201d of England); cf. 5 St. G. Tucker,\nBlackstone\u2019s Commentaries 349, n.\u00a02 (1803). It is therefore\n\u201centirely proper to look to the common law\u201d to ascertain whether\nthe Sixth Amendment requires the result the Court today reaches.Apprendi,supra,at 500, n.\u00a01.The Sixth Amendment\u2019s specific guarantee of\nimpartiality incorporates the common-law understanding of that\nterm. See,e.g.,3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 365 (1769) (Blackstone) (describing English trials as\n\u201cimpartially just\u201d because of their \u201ccaution against all partiality\nand bias\u201d in the jury). The common law required a juror to have\n\u201cfreedome of mind\u201d and to be \u201cindifferent as hee stands unsworne.\u201d\n1 E. Coke, First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England\n\u00a7234, p. 155a (16th ed. 1809); accord, 3 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment\nof the Law 258 (3d ed. 1768); cf. T. Cooley, A Treatise on the\nConstitutional Limitations Which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of\nthe States of the American Union 319 (1868) (\u201cThe jury must be\nindifferent between the prisoner and the commonwealth\u201d). Impartial\njurors could \u201chave no interest of their own affected, and no\npersonal bias, or pre-possession, in favor [of] or against either\nparty.\u201dPettisv.Warren, 1 Kirby 426, 427 (Conn.\nSuper. 1788).IIThe common-law right to a jury trial did not,\nhowever, guarantee a defendant the right to impeach a jury verdict\nwith juror testimony about juror misconduct, including \u201ca principal\nspecies of [juror] misbehaviour\u201d\u2014\u201cnotorious partiality.\u201d 3\nBlackstone 388. Although partiality was a ground for setting aside\na jury verdict,ibid.,the English common-law rule at the\ntime the Sixth Amendment was ratified did not allow jurors to\nsupply evidence of that misconduct. In 1770, Lord Mansfield refused\nto receive a juror\u2019s affidavit to impeach a verdict, declaring that\nsuch an affidavit \u201ccan\u2019t be read.\u201dRexv.Almon, 5\nBurr. 2687, 98 Eng. Rep. 411 (K. B.). And in 1785, Lord Mansfield\nsolidified the doctrine, holding that \u201c[t]he Court [could not]\nreceive such an affidavit from any of the jurymen\u201d to prove that\nthe jury had cast lots to reach a verdict.Vaisev.Delaval, 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B.).[1]At the time of the founding, the States took\nmixed approaches to this issue. SeeCluggagev.Swan,\n4 Binn. 150, 156 (Pa. 1811) (opinion of Yeates, J.) (\u201cThe opinions\nofAmericanjudges .\u00a0.\u00a0. have greatly differed on\nthe point in question\u201d);Bishopv.Georgia, 9 Ga.\n121, 126 (1850) (describing the common law in 1776 on this question\nas \u201cin atransitionstate\u201d). Many States followed Lord\nMansfield\u2019s no-impeachment rule and refused to receive juror\naffidavits. See,e.g.,Brewsterv.Thompson, 1\nN.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 32 (1790) (per curiam);Robbinsv.Windover, 2 Tyl. 11, 14 (Vt. 1802);Taylorv.Giger, 3 Ky. 586, 597\u2013598 (1808);Pricev.McIlvain, 2 Tread. 503, 504 (S.\u00a0C. 1815);Tylerv.Stevens, 4 N.\u00a0H. 116, 117 (1827); 1 Z. Swift, A\nDigest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 775 (1822) (\u201cIn\nEngland, and in the courts of the United States, jurors are not\npermitted to be witnesses respecting the misconduct of the jury\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and this is, most unquestionably, the correct\nprinciple\u201d). Some States, however, permitted juror affidavits about\njuror misconduct. See,e.g., Crawfordv.State, 10\nTenn. 60, 68 (1821);Cochranv.Street, 1 Va. 79, 81\n(1792). And others initially permitted such evidence but quickly\nreversed course. Compare,e.g., Smithv.Cheetham, 3\nCai. R. 57, 59\u201360 (N.\u00a0Y. 1805) (opinion of Livingston, J.)\n(permitting juror testimony), withDanav.Tucker, 4\nJohns. 487, 488\u2013489 (N.\u00a0Y. 1809) (per curiam)\n(overturningCheetham); compare alsoBradley\u2019s Lesseev.Bradley, 4 Dall. 112 (Pa. 1792) (permitting juror\naffidavits), with,e.g.,Cluggage,supra,at\n156\u2013158 (opinion of Yeates, J.) (explaining thatBradleywas\nincorrectly reported and rejecting affidavits); compare alsoTalmadgev.Northrop, 1 Root 522 (Conn. 1793)\n(admitting juror testimony), withStatev.Freeman, 5\nConn. 348, 350\u2013352 (1824) (\u201cThe opinion of almostthe whole legal\nworld is adverse to the reception of the testimony in question;\nand, in my opinion, on invincible foundations\u201d).By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was\nratified, Lord Mansfield\u2019s no-impeachment rule had become firmly\nentrenched in American law. See Lettow, New Trial for Verdict\nAgainst Law: Judge-Jury Relations in Early-Nineteenth Century\nAmerica, 71 Notre Dame L.\u00a0Rev. 505, 536 (1996) (\u201c[O]pponents\nof juror affidavits had largely won out by the middle of the\ncentury\u201d); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a72352, p.\n697 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961) (Wigmore) (Lord Mansfield\u2019s rule\n\u201ccame to receive in the United States an adherence almost\nunquestioned\u201d); J. Proffatt, A Treatise on Trial by Jury \u00a7408, p.\n467 (1877) (\u201cIt is a well established rule of law that no affidavit\nshall be received from a juror to impeach his verdict\u201d). The vast\nmajority of States adopted the no-impeachment rule as a matter of\ncommon law. See,e.g.,Bullv.Commonwealth,\n55 Va. 613, 627\u2013628 (1857) (\u201c[T]he practice appears to be now\ngenerally settled, to reject the testimony of jurors when offered\nto impeach their verdict. The cases on the subject are too numerous\nto be cited\u201d);Tuckerv.Town Council of South\nKingstown, 5 R.\u00a0I. 558, 560 (1859) (collecting cases);Statev.Coupenhaver, 39 Mo. 430 (1867) (\u201cThe law is\nwell settled that a traverse juror cannot be a witness to prove\nmisbehavior in the jury in regard to their verdict\u201d);Peckv.Brewer, 48 Ill. 54, 63 (1868) (\u201cSo far back as\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. 1823, the doctrine was held that the affidavits of\njurors cannot be heard to impeach their verdict\u201d);Heffronv.Gallupe, 55 Me. 563, 566 (1868) (ruling inadmissible\n\u201cdepositions of .\u00a0.\u00a0. jurors as to what transpired in the\njury room\u201d);Withersv.Fiscus, 40 Ind. 131, 131\u2013132\n(1872) (\u201cIn the United States it seems to be settled,\nnotwithstanding a few adjudications to the con-trary\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. , that such affidavits cannot be\nreceived\u201d).[2]The Court today acknowledges that the States\n\u201cadopted the Mansfield rule as a matter of common law,\u201dante,at 6, but ascribes no significance to that fact. I\nwould hold that it is dispositive. Our common-law history does not\nestablish that\u2014in either 1791 (when the Sixth Amendment was\nratified) or 1868 (when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified)\u2014a\ndefendant had the right to impeach a verdict with juror testimony\nof juror misconduct. In fact, it strongly suggests that such\nevidence was prohibited. In the absence of a definitive common-law\ntradition permitting impeachment by juror testimony, we have no\nbasis to invoke a constitutional provision that merely \u201cfollow[s]\nout the established course of the common law in all trials for\ncrimes,\u201d 3 Story \u00a71785, at 662, to overturn Colorado\u2019s decision to\npreserve the no-impeachment rule, cf.Boumedienev.Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723 \u2013833 (2008) (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Perhaps good reasons exist to curtail or\nabandon the no-impeachment rule. Some States have done so, see\nAppendix to majority opinion,ante, and others have not.\nUltimately, that question is not for us to decide. It should be\nleft to the political process described by Justice Alito. Seepost,at 5\u20137 (dissenting opinion). In its attempt to\nstimulate a \u201cthoughtful, rational dialogue\u201d on race relations,ante,at 21, the Court today ends the political process and\nimposes a uniform, national rule. The Constitution does not require\nsuch a rule. Neither should we.I respectfully dissent.Notes1Prior to 1770, it appears\nthat juror affidavits were sometimes received to impeach a verdict\non the ground of juror misbehavior, al-though only \u201cwith great\ncaution.\u201dMcDonaldv.Pless, 238 U.\u00a0S. 264, 268\n(1915) ; see,e.g.,Dentv.The Hundred of\nHertford, 2 Salk. 645, 91 Eng. Rep. 546 (K. B. 1696);Philipsv.Fowler, Barnes. 441, 94 Eng. Rep. 994 (K.\nB. 1735). But \u201cprevious to our Revolution, and at least as early as\n1770, the doctrine in England was distinctly ruled the other way,\nand has so stood ever since.\u201d 3 T. Waterman, A Treatise on the\nPrinciples of Law and Equity Which Govern Courts in the Granting of\nNew Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 1429 (1855).2Although two States\ndeclined to follow the rule in the mid-19th century, seeWrightv.Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195,\n210 (1866);Perryv.Bailey, 12 Kan. 539, 544\u2013545\n(1874), \u201cmost of the state courts\u201d had already \u201ccommitted\nthemselves upon the subject,\u201d 8 Wigmore \u00a72354, at 702.",
