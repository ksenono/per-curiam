S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-1256PHILIP MORRIS USA, PETITIONERv.MAYOLA\nWILLIAMS, personal representative of the ESTATE OF JESSE D.\nWILLIAMS, DECEASEDon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\noregon[February 20, 2007]Justice Thomas, dissenting.I join Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent\nin full. I write separately to reiterate my view that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nConstitution does not constrain the size of punitive damages\nawards.\u2019\u00a0\u201dState Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.v.Campbell,538 U. S. 408, 429\u2013430\n(2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quotingCooper Industries,\nInc.v.Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,532 U. S. 424, 443\n(2001) (Thomas, J., concurring)). It matters not that the Court\nstyles today\u2019s holding as \u201cprocedural\u201d because the \u201cprocedural\u201d\nrule is simply a confusing implementation of the substantive due\nprocess regime this Court has created for punitive damages. SeePacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Haslip,499 U. S. 1, 26\u201327 (1991)\n(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cIn 1868 \u2026 punitive damages\nwere undoubtedly an established part of the American common law of\ntorts. It is \u2026 clear that no particular procedures were deemed\nnecessary to circumscribe a jury\u2019s discretion regarding the award\nof such damages, or their amount\u201d). Today\u2019s opinion proves once\nagain that this Court\u2019s punitive damages jurisprudence is\n\u201cinsusceptible of principled application.\u201dBMW of North\nAmerica, Inc.v.Gore,517 U. S. 559, 599\n(1996) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting).",
