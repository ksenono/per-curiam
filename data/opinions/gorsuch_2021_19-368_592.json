A tribunal with \u201cgeneral\njurisdiction\u201d may entertain any claim against the defendant. But to\ntrigger this power, a court usually must ensure the defendant is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018at home\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the forum State.Daimler AGv.Bauman,571 U.S.\n117, 137 (2014). Meanwhile, \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d affords a\nnarrower authority. It applies only when the defendant\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018purposefully avails\u2019\u00a0\u201d itself of the opportunity to do\nbusiness in the forum State and the suit \u201c\u00a0\u2018arise[s] out of or\nrelate[s] to\u2019\u00a0\u201d the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State.Burger King Corp.v.Rudzewicz,471 U.S.\n462, 472, 475 (1985).While our cases have long admonished lower\ncourts to keep these concepts distinct, some of the old guardrails\nhave begun to look a little battered. Take general jurisdiction. If\nit made sense to speak of a corporation having one or two \u201chomes\u201d\nin 1945, it seems almost quaint in 2021 when corporations with\nglobal reach often have massive operations spread across multiple\nStates. To cope with these changing economic realities, this Court\nhas begun cautiously expanding the old rule in \u201c\u00a0\u2018exceptional\ncase[s].\u2019\u00a0\u201dBNSF R. Co.v.Tyrrell, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10).Today\u2019s case tests the old boundaries from\nanother direction. Until now, many lower courts have proceeded on\nthe premise that specific jurisdiction requires two things. First,\nthe defendant must \u201cpurposefully avail\u201d itself of the chance to do\nbusiness in a State. Second, the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s suit must \u201carise\nout of or relate to\u201d the defendant\u2019s in-state activities.\nTypically, courts have read this second phrase as a unit requiring\nat least a but-for causal link between the defendant\u2019s local\nactivities and the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s injuries.E.g.,Tamburov.Dworkin, 601 F.3d 693, 708\u2013709 (CA7 2010)\n(collecting cases); see alsoBurger King, 471 U.\u00a0S., at\n475 (discussing \u201cproximate[\u00a0] results\u201d). As every first year\nlaw student learns, a but-for causation test isn\u2019t the most\ndemanding. At a high level of abstraction, one might say any event\nin the world would not have happened \u201cbut for\u201d events far and long\nremoved.Now, though, the Court pivots away from this\nunderstanding. Focusing on the phrase \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d\nthat so often appears in our cases, the majority asks us to parse\nthose words \u201cas though we were dealing with language of a statute.\u201dReiterv.Sonotone Corp.,442\nU.S. 330, 341 (1979). In particular, the majority zeros in on\nthe disjunctive conjunction \u201cor,\u201d and proceeds to build its entire\nopinion around that linguistic feature.Ante, at 8\u20139. The\nmajority admits that \u201carise out of\u00a0\u201d may connote causation.\nBut, it argues, \u201crelate to\u201d is an independent clause that does\nnot.Where this leaves us is far from clear. For a\ncase to \u201crelate to\u201d the defendant\u2019s forum contacts, the majority\nsays, it is enough if an \u201caffiliation\u201d or \u201crelationship\u201d or\n\u201cconnection\u201d exists between them.Ante,at 6, 12, 16. But\nwhat does this assortment of nounsmean? Loosed from any\ncausation standard, we are left to guess. The majority promises\nthat its new test \u201cdoes not mean anything goes,\u201d but that hardly\ntells us what does.Ante,at 9. In some cases, the new test\nmay prove more forgiving than the old causation rule. But it\u2019s hard\nnot to wonder whether it may also sometimes turn out to be more\ndemanding. Unclear too is whether, in cases like that, the majority\nwould treat causation and \u201caffiliation\u201d as alternative routes to\nspecific jurisdiction, or whether it would deny jurisdiction\noutright.For a glimpse at the complications invited by\ntoday\u2019s decision, consider its treatment of North Dakota and\nWashington. Those are the States where Ford first sold the\nallegedly defective cars at issue in the cases before us. The\nmajority seems to suggest that, if the plaintiffs had sought to\nbring their suits in those States, they would have failed. The\nmajority stresses that the \u201conly connection\u201d between the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims and North Dakota and Washington is the fact that\nformer owners once bought the allegedly defective cars there.Ante,at 15. But the majority never tells us why that\n\u201cconnection\u201d isn\u2019t enough. Surely, North Dakota and Washington\nwould contend they have a strong interest in ensuring they don\u2019t\nbecome marketplaces for unreasonably dangerous products. Nor is it\nclear why the majority casts doubt on the availability of specific\njurisdiction in these States without bothering to consider whether\nthe old causation test might allow it. After all, no one doubts\nFord purposefully availed itself of those markets. The plaintiffs\u2019\ninjuries, at least arguably, \u201carose from\u201d (or were caused by) the\nsale of defective cars in those places. Even if the majority\u2019s new\naffiliation test isn\u2019t satisfied, don\u2019t we still need to ask those\ncausation questions, or are they now to be abandoned?Consider, too, a hypothetical the majority\noffers in a footnote. The majority imagines a retiree in Maine who\nstarts a one-man business, carving and selling wooden duck decoys.\nIn time, the man sells a defective decoy over the Internet to a\npurchaser in another State who is injured. Seeante, at 13,\nn.\u00a04. We aren\u2019t told how. (Was the decoy coated in lead\npaint?) But put that aside. The majority says this hypothetical\nsupplies a useful study in contrast with our cases. On the\nmajority\u2019s telling, Ford\u2019s \u201ccontinuous\u201d contacts with Montana and\nMinnesota are enough to establish an \u201caffiliation\u201d with those\nStates; by comparison, the decoy seller\u2019s contacts may be too\n\u201cisolated\u201d and \u201csporadic\u201d to entitle an injured buyer to sue in his\nhome State. But if this comparison highlights anything, it is only\nthe litigation sure to follow. For between the poles of\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d and \u201cisolated\u201d contacts lie a virtually infinite\nnumber of \u201caffiliations\u201d waiting to be explored. And when it comes\nto that vast terrain, the majority supplies no meaningful guidance\nabout what kind or how much of an \u201caffiliation\u201d will suffice. Nor,\nonce more, does the majority tell us whether its new affiliation\ntest supplants or merely supplements the old causation inquiry.Not only does the majority\u2019s new test risk\nadding new layers of confusion to our personal jurisdiction\njurisprudence. The whole project seems unnecessary. Immediately\nafter disavowing any need for a causal link between the defendant\u2019s\nforum activities and the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, the majority\nproceeds to admit that such a link may be present here.Ante,at 14. The majority stresses that the Montana and\nMinnesota plaintiffs before us \u201cmight\u201d have purchased their cars\nbecause of Ford\u2019s activities in their home States. They \u201cmay\u201d have\nrelied on Ford\u2019s local advertising. And they \u201cmay\u201d have depended on\nFord\u2019s promise to furnish in-state servicers and dealers. If the\nmajority is right about these things, that would be more than\nenough to establish a but-for causal link between Ford\u2019s in-state\nactivities and the plaintiffs\u2019 decisions to purchase their\nallegedly defective vehicles. Nor should that result come as a\nsurprise: One might expect such causal links to be easy to prove in\nsuits against corporate behemoths like Ford. All the new\neuphemisms\u2014\u201caffiliation,\u201d \u201crelationship,\u201d \u201cconnection\u201d\u2014thus seem\npretty pointless.[1]*With the oldInternational Shoedichotomy looking increasingly uncertain, it\u2019s hard not to ask how\nwe got here and where we might be headed.BeforeInternational Shoe, it seems due\nprocess was usually understood to guarantee that only a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction could deprive a defendant of his life,\nliberty, or property. In turn, a court\u2019s competency normally\ndepended on the defendant\u2019s presence in, or consent to, the\nsovereign\u2019s jurisdiction. But once a plaintiff was able to \u201ctag\u201d\nthe defendant with process in the jurisdiction, that State\u2019s courts\nwere generally thought competent to render judgment on any claim\nagainst the defendant, whether it involved events inside or outside\nthe State.Pennoyerv.Neff,95 U.S.\n714, 733 (1878);Burnhamv.Superior Court of\nCal.,County of Marin,495\nU.S. 604, 610\u2013611 (1990); J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConflict of Laws 912\u2013913 (3d ed. 1846);Massiev.Watts, 6 Cranch 148, 157, 161\u2013162 (1810).[2]International Shoe\u2019s emergence may be\nattributable to many influences, but at least part of the story\nseems to involve the rise of corporations and interstate trade. SeeHonda Motor Co.v.Oberg,512\nU.S. 415, 431 (1994). A corporation doing business in its State\nof incorporation is one thing; the old physical presence rules for\nindividuals seem easily adaptable to them. But what happens when a\ncorporation, created and able to operate thanks to the laws of one\nState, seeks the privilege of sending agents or products into\nanother State?Early on, many state courts held conduct like\nthat renders an out-of-state corporation present in the second\njurisdiction. And a present company could be sued for any claim, so\nlong as the plaintiff served an employee doing corporate business\nwithin the second State.E.g.,Pennsylvania Lumbermen\u2019s\nMut. Fire Ins. Co.v.Meyer,197\nU.S. 407, 413\u2013415 (1905). Other States sought to obviate any\npotential question about corporate jurisdiction by requiring an\nout-of-state corporation to incorporate under their laws too, or at\nleast designate an agent for service of process. Either way, the\nidea was to secure the out-of-state company\u2019s presence or consent\nto suit.E.g.,Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. of\nPhiladelphiav.Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co.,243 U.S.\n93, 95\u201396 (1917).Unsurprisingly, corporations soon looked for\nways around rules like these. No one, after all, has ever liked\ngreeting the process server. For centuries, individuals facing\nimminent suit sought to avoid it by fleeing the court\u2019s territorial\njurisdiction. But this tactic proved \u201ctoo crude for the American\nbusiness genius,\u201d and it held some obvious disadvantages. See\nJackson, What Price \u201cDue Process,\u201d5 N. Y. L. Rev. 435, 436\n(1927). Corporations wanted to retain the privilege of sending\ntheir personnel and products to other jurisdictions where they\nlacked a charter to do business. At the same time, when confronted\nwith lawsuits in the second forum, they sought to hide behind their\nforeign charters and deny their presence. Really, their strategy\nwas to do business without being seen to do business.Id.,\nat 438 (\u201cNo longer is the foreign corporation confronted with the\nproblem \u2018to be or not to be\u2019\u2014it can both be and not be!\u201d).Initially and routinely, state courts rejected\nploys like these. See,e.g., Pullman Palace Car Co.v.Lawrence, 74 Miss. 782, 796\u2013799, 22 So. 53, 55\u201356 (Miss.\n1897). But, in a series of decisions at the turn of the last\ncentury, this Court eventually provided a more receptive audience.\nOn the one hand, the Court held that an out-of-state corporation\noften has a right to do business in another State unencumbered by\nthat State\u2019s registration rules, thanks to the so-called dormant\nCommerce Clause.International Textbook Co.v.Pigg,217 U.S.\n91, 107\u2013112 (1910). On the other hand, the Court began invoking\nthe Due Process Clause to restrict the circumstances in which an\nout-of-state corporation could be deemed present. So, for example,\nthe Court ruled that even an Oklahoma corporation purchasing a\nlarge portion of its merchandise in New York was not \u201cdoing\nbusiness\u201d there.RosenbergBros. & Co.v.Curtis Brown Co.,260 U.S.\n516, 517\u2013518 (1923). Perhaps advocates of this arrangement\nthought it promoted national economic growth. See Dodd,\nJurisdiction in Personal Actions, 23 Ill. L.\u00a0Rev. 427, 444\u2013445\n(1929). But critics questioned its fidelity to the Constitution and\ntraditional jurisdictional principles, noting that it often left\ninjured parties with no practical forum for their claims too.\nJackson, 5 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev., at 436\u2013438.In many ways,International Shoesought\nto start over. The Court \u201ccast .\u00a0.\u00a0. aside\u201d the old\nconcepts of territorial jurisdiction that its own earlier decisions\nhad seemingly twisted in favor of out-of-state corporations.Burnham, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 618. At the same time, the Courtalsocast doubt on the idea, once pursued by many state\ncourts, that a company \u201cconsents\u201d to suit when it is forced to\nincorporate or designate an agent for receipt of process in a\njurisdiction other than its home State.Ibid.[3] In place of nearly everything that had\ncome before, the Court sought to build a new test focused on\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.\u2019\u00a0\u201dInternational Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at 316\n(quotingMillikenv.Meyer,311\nU.S. 457, 463 (1940)).It was a heady promise. But it is unclear how\nfar it has really taken us. Even today, this Court usually\nconsiders corporations \u201cat home\u201d and thus subject to general\njurisdiction in only one or two States. All in a world where global\nconglomerates boast of their many \u201cheadquarters.\u201d The Court has\nissued these restrictive rulings, too, even thoughindividualdefendants remain subject to the old \u201ctag\u201d rule,\nallowing them to be sued on any claim anywhere they can be found.Burnham, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 610\u2013611.[4] Nearly 80 years removed fromInternational\nShoe, it seems corporations continue to receive special\njurisdictional protections in the name of the Constitution. Less\nclear is why.Maybe, too,International Shoejust\ndoesn\u2019t work quite as well as it once did. For a period, its\nspecific jurisdiction test might have seemed a reasonable new\nsubstitute for assessing corporate \u201cpresence,\u201d a way to identify\nthose out-of-state corporations that were simply pretending to be\nabsent from jurisdictions where they were really transacting\nbusiness. When a company \u201cpurposefully availed\u201d itself of the\nbenefits of another State\u2019s market in the 1940s, it often involved\nsending in agents, advertising in local media, or developing a\nnetwork of on-the-ground dealers, much as Ford did in these cases.E.g.,International Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at 313\u2013314,\n320. But, today, even an individual retiree carving wooden decoys\nin Maine can \u201cpurposefully avail\u201d himself of the chance to do\nbusiness across the continent after drawing online orders to his\ne-Bay \u201cstore\u201d thanks to Internet advertising with global reach.Ante, at 12\u201313, n.\u00a04. A test once aimed at keeping\ncorporations honest about their out-of-state operations now\nseemingly risks hauling individuals to jurisdictions where they\nhave never set foot.Perhaps this is the real reason why the majority\nintroduces us to the hypothetical decoy salesman. Yes, he arguably\navailed himself of a new market. Yes, the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s\ninjuries arguably arose from (or were caused by) the product he\nsold there. Yes,International Shoe\u2019s old causation test\nwould seemingly allow for personal jurisdiction. But maybe the\nmajority resists that conclusion because the old test no longer\nseems as reliable a proxy for determining corporate presence as it\nonce did. Maybethat\u2019sthe intuition lying behind the\nmajority\u2019s introduction of its new \u201caffiliation\u201d rule and its\ncomparison of the Maine retiree\u2019s \u201csporadic\u201d and \u201cisolated\u201d sales\nin the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s State and Ford\u2019s deep \u201crelationships\u201d and\n\u201cconnections\u201d with Montana and Minnesota.Ante,at 13,\nn.\u00a04.If that is the logic at play here, I cannot help\nbut wonder if we are destined to return where we began. Perhaps all\nof this Court\u2019s efforts sinceInternational Shoe, including\nthose of today\u2019s majority, might be understood as seeking to\nrecreate in new terms a jurisprudence about corporate jurisdiction\nthat was developing before this Court\u2019s muscular interventions in\nthe early 20th century. Perhaps it was, is, and in the end always\nwill be about trying to assess fairly a corporate defendant\u2019s\npresence or consent.International Shoemay have sought to\nmove past those questions. But maybe all we have done since is\nstruggle for new words to express the old ideas. Perhaps, too, none\nof this should come as a surprise. New technologies and new schemes\nto evade the process server will always be with us. But if our\nconcern is with \u201c\u00a0\u2018traditionalnotions of fair play and\nsubstantial justice,\u2019\u00a0\u201dInternational Shoe, 326\nU.\u00a0S., at 316 (emphasis added), not just our personal and\nidiosyncratic impressions of those things, perhaps we will always\nwind up asking variations of the same questions.[5]None of this is to cast doubt on the outcome of\nthese cases. The parties have not pointed to anything in the\nConstitution\u2019s original meaning or its history that might allow\nFord to evade answering the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in Montana or\nMinnesota courts. No one seriously questions that the company,\nseeking to do business, entered those jurisdictions through the\nfront door. And I cannot see why, when faced with the process\nserver, it should be allowed to escape out the back. Jackson, 5\nN.\u00a0Y.\u00a0L. Rev., at 439. The real struggle here isn\u2019t with\nsettling on the right outcome in these cases, but with making sense\nof our personal jurisdiction jurisprudence andInternational\nShoe\u2019s increasingly doubtful dichotomy. On those scores, I\nreadily admit that I finish these cases with even more questions\nthan I had at the start. Hopefully, future litigants and lower\ncourts will help us face these tangles and sort out a responsible\nway to address the challenges posed by our changing economy in\nlight of the Constitution\u2019s text and the lessons of history.Notes1The majority says\npersonal jurisdiction should not turn on a plain-tiff\u2019s ability to\n\u201callege\u201d or \u201cestablish\u201d his or her reasons for doing business with\nthe defendant.Ante, at 14. But the implicit assumption\nhere\u2014that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving personal\njurisdiction\u2014is often mistaken. Perhaps because a lack of personal\njurisdiction is a waivable affirmative defense, some States place\nthe burden of proving the defense on the defendant. Even in places\nwhere the plaintiff bears the burden, I fail to see why it would be\nso terrible (or burdensome) to require an individual to plead and\nprove his or her reasons for purchase. Frequently, doing so may be\nsimple\u2014far simpler than showing how the defendant\u2019s connections\nwith the jurisdiction satisfy a new and amorphous \u201caffiliation\u201d\ntest.2Some disagree that due\nprocess requires even this much. Recent scholarship, for example,\ncontendsPennoyer\u2019s territorial account of sovereign power\nis mostly right, but the rules it embodies are not \u201cfixed in\nconstitutional amber\u201d\u2014that is, Congress might be able to change\nthem. Sachs,PennoyerWas Right, 95 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 1249,\n1255 (2017). Others suggest that fights over personal jurisdiction\nwould be more sensibly waged under the Full Faith and Credit\nClause. Jackson, Full Faith and Credit\u2014The Lawyer\u2019s Clause of the\nConstitution, 45 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 3 (1945). Whether these\ntheories are right or wrong, they at least seek to answer the right\nquestion\u2014what the Constitution as originally understood requires,\nnot what nine judges consider \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cjust.\u201d3It is unclear what\nremains of the old \u201cconsent\u201d theory afterInternational\nShoe\u2019s criticism. Some courts readInternational Shoeand the cases that follow as effectively foreclosing it, while\nothers insist it remains viable. CompareLanhamv.BNSF\nR. Co., 305 Neb. 124, 130\u2013136, 939 N.W.2d 363, 368\u2013371 (Neb.\n2020), withRodriguezv.Ford Motor Co.,\n2019-NMCA-023, \u00b612\u2013\u00b614, 458 P.3d 569, 575\u2013576 (N.\u00a0M. Ct. App.\n2018).4SinceBurnham,\nsome courts have sought to revive the tag rule for artificial\nentities while others argue that doing so would be inconsistentwithInternational Shoe. CompareFirst Am. Corp.v.Price Waterhouse LLP,154 F.3d 16, 20\u201321 (CA2 1998), withMartinezv.Aero\nCaribbean, 764 F.3d 1062, 1067\u20131069 (CA9 2014).5The majority worries that\nthe thoughts expressed here threaten to \u201ctransfigure our specific\njurisdiction standard as applied to corporations\u201d and \u201creturn [us]\nto the mid-19th century.\u201dAnte, at 7, n.\u00a02;ante, at 9, n.\u00a03. But it has become a tired trope to\ncriticize any reference to the Constitution\u2019s original meaning as\n(somehow) both radical and antiquated.\u00a0 Seeking to understand\nthe Constitution\u2019s original meaning is part of our job.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the majority\u2019s real worry anyway\u2014that corporations might\nlose special protections?\u00a0 The Constitution has always allowed\nsuits againstindividualson any issue in any State where\nthey set foot.Supra,at 8\u20139.\u00a0 Yet the majority\nseems to recoil at even entertaining the possibility the\nConstitution might tolerate similar results for \u201cnationwide\ncorporation[s],\u201d whose \u201cbusiness is everywhere.\u201dAnte,\nat 2;ante, at 9, n.\u00a03.",
