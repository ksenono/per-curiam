S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-846UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.TOHONO\nO\u2019ODHAM NATIONon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit[April 26, 2011]Justice Sotomayor, with whom\nJustice Breyer joins, concurring in the judgment.Congress enacted the statute\ncurrently codified at 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71500 to put an end to\nparallel litigation seeking duplicative relief against the United\nStates and its agents. Respondent Tohono O\u2019odham Nation seeks in\nthe Court of Federal Claims (CFC) some of the same relief on the\nsame facts as it does in its pending District Court action.\nAccordingly, applying our decision inKeene Corp.v.United States,508 U. S. 200(1993), I agree with the\nCourt that \u00a71500 bars the Nation\u2019s CFC action. Because the Nation\u2019s\ntwo actions seek overlapping relief, this case does not present the\nquestion that the Court decides today\u2014whether \u00a71500 bars an action\nin the CFC when the plaintiff\u2019s actions share a common factual\nbasis but seek different forms of relief. Nonetheless, the Court\nholds that a common factual basis alone suffices to bar\njurisdiction in the CFC. Under the Court\u2019s reading of the statute,\na plaintiff cannot pursue a claim in the CFC based on the same\nfacts as another pending action, even when Congress has required\nthat plaintiff to file separate actions in two courts to obtain\ndifferent forms of relief necessary to make the plaintiff whole. I\ncannot agree that \u00a71500 demands this result.ISection 1500 bars jurisdiction in\nthe CFC over \u201cany claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff \u2026\nhas pending in any other court any suit or process against the\nUnited States\u201d or any agent of the United States. InKeene, we construed this statute to \u201cturn on whether the\nplaintiff\u2019s other suit was based on substantially the same\noperative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least if there\nwas some overlap in the relief requested.\u201dId., at 212. It\nwas irrelevant for purposes of \u00a71500, we observed, that the two\nsuits proceeded on different legal theories.Id., at 212.\nBecause the plaintiff\u2019s actions both sought the same monetary\nrelief, albeit on different theories, we held that the CFC lacked\njurisdiction.Id., at 217\u2013218. We thus found \u201cit\nunnecessary to consider\u201d whether \u00a71500 barred a CFC claim that was\nbased on substantially the same operative facts as another suit but\nthat sought different relief. Seeid., at 212, n.\u00a06,\n216.As construed inKeene,\n\u00a71500 bars the Nation\u2019s CFC action. As the majority holds, seeante, at 9\u201310, the Nation\u2019s CFC and District Court actions\nare based on nearly identical facts. The two actions also seek\noverlapping relief: Both complaints request money to remedy the\nsame injury\u2014the Government\u2019s alleged breach of its fiduciary duty\nto maintain accurate accounts of the Nation\u2019s assets. The Nation\ndoes not dispute that its District Court complaint requests such\nrelief.[Footnote 1] See Brief\nfor Respondent 51 (\u201cIf \u2026 the accounting reveals that assets that\nbelong to the Nation do not appear on the books, it may be\nappropriate to order equitable restitution of those assets\u201d). The\nNation\u2019s CFC complaint is fairly read to do the same. The CFC\ncomplaint alleges that the Government has failed \u201cto keep and\nrender clear and accurate accounts.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. It\nclaims that by reason of this and other alleged breaches of\nfiduciary duty, the Nation \u201chas been damaged in such amounts as may\nbe proven at trial.\u201dId., at 67a. And the complaint\nrequests \u201ca determination that the Defendant is liable to the\nNation in damages for the injuries and losses caused as a result of\nDefendant\u2019s breaches of fiduciary duty\u201d and a \u201cdetermination of the\namount of damages due the Nation.\u201dId., at 72a\u201373a. Thus,\njust like the District Court complaint, the CFC complaint requests\nmoney to remedy the Government\u2019s alleged failure to keep accurate\naccounts.[Footnote 2]Because the Nation\u2019s two complaints are \u201cbased\non substantially the same operative facts\u201d and there is \u201cat least \u2026\nsome overlap in the relief requested,\u201dKeene, 508 U. S.,\nat 212, \u00a71500 bars jurisdiction over the Nation\u2019s CFC action.IIThe case does not present the\nquestion, left open inKeene, \u201cwhether common facts\n[alone] are sufficient to bar a CFC action where a similar case is\npending elsewhere.\u201dAnte, at 9. Indeed, for most of the\nhistory of this case, the Government did not even argue that common\nfacts were sufficient to preclude CFC jurisdiction; until its\npetition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the Government\nargued only thatKeenerequired dismissal of the Nation\u2019s\nCFC action because the Nation\u2019s two actions were based on the same\nfacts and sought overlapping relief. Deciding this case on the\nbasis ofKeenewould have been the \u201cfar more prudent\ncourse than recharacterizing the case in an attempt to reach\npremature decision on an important question.\u201dMissouriv.Jenkins,495\nU. S. 33, 80 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). Instead, discarding the restraint we\nexhibited inKeene, the Court unnecessarily chooses to\nhold that \u00a71500 bars jurisdiction in the CFC whenever a plaintiff\u2019s\nCFC action is based on substantially the same facts as a suit\npending elsewhere.[Footnote 3]\nThis reading of \u00a71500 is, in my opinion, incorrect.ASince the enactment of \u00a71500 in\n1868, Congress has expanded the avenues by which persons with\nlegitimate claims against the United States may obtain relief. Seeante, at 6. In some circumstances, Congress has chosen to\nrequire plaintiffs to file actions in two different courts to\nobtain complete relief relating to a single set of operative facts.\nFor example, with some exceptions, the CFC has no power to issue\nequitable relief. SeeBowenv.Massachusetts,487 U. S. 879,\n905 (1988); see also 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491(a). As a result, a\nplaintiff seeking both money damages and injunctive relief to\nremedy distinct harms arising from the same set of facts may be\nforced to file actions in both the CFC and federal district\ncourt.For half a century, the CFC has\nrecognized that \u00a71500 does not preclude jurisdiction in that court\nwhen Congress has required a plaintiff to split a claim into two\nactions to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make the\nplaintiff whole. InCasmanv.United States, 135\nCt. Cl. 647 (1956), a terminated federal employee sought backpay in\nthe Court of Claims and reinstatement to his position in District\nCourt. The plaintiff\u2019s two suits arose from the same facts (his\ntermination) but sought \u201centirely different\u201d forms of relief within\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of two courts.[Footnote 4]Id., at 650. In light of our\nprevious recognition that the purpose of \u00a71500 \u201c\u00a0\u2018was only to\nrequire an election between a suit in the Court of Claims and one\nbrought in another court,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 649 (quotingMatson Nav. Co.v.United States,284 U. S. 352, 355\u2013356\n(1932)), the Court of Claims held that \u00a71500 was inapplicable when\na \u201cplaintiff has no right to elect between two courts,\u201d 135 Ct.\nCl., at 650. To hold otherwise, the court acknowledged, \u201cwould be\nto say to plaintiff, \u2018If you want your job back you must forget\nyour back pay\u2019; conversely, \u2018If you want your back pay, you cannot\nhave your job back.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.;see alsoLoveladies\nHarbor, Inc.v.United States, 27 F.\u00a03d 1545,\n1551 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (reaffirmingCasman\u2019s\ninquiry into the form of relief sought).By reserving the question \u201cwhether two actions\nbased on the same operative facts, but seeking completely different\nrelief, would implicate \u00a71500,\u201d our decision inKeeneexpressly preserved theCasmanholding. 508 U. S., at 212,\nn.\u00a06. The consequence of today\u2019s decision is clear: TheCasmanrule is no longer good law. Under the majority\u2019s\nreading of \u00a71500, because Casman\u2019s two suits were based on common\nfacts, \u00a71500 barred jurisdiction in the CFC over his backpay claim\neven though he could not have obtained backpay in his District\nCourt action.The jurisdictional scheme governing actions\nagainst the United States often requires other plaintiffs to file\ntwo actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in\nconnection with one set of facts. As just one example, an action\nseeking injunctive relief to set aside agency action must proceed\nin district court, but a claim that the same agency action\nconstitutes a taking of property requiring just compensation must\nproceed in the CFC. See,e.g.,Alaskav.United States, 32 Fed. Cl. 689 (1995). After today\u2019s\ndecision, \u00a71500 may well prevent a plaintiff from pursuing a\ntakings claim in the CFC if an action to set aside the agency\naction is pending in district court. This type of plaintiff may\nface a choice between equally unattractive options: forgo\ninjunctive relief in the district court to preserve her claim for\nmonetary relief in the CFC, or pursue injunctive relief and hope\nthat the statute of limitations on her takings claim, see 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72501, does not expire before the district court action\nis resolved.[Footnote 5]B1The text, purpose, and history of\n\u00a71500 provide strong reason to believe that Congress did not intend\nfor \u00a71500 to put plaintiffs to a choice between two nonduplicative\nremedies that Congress has made available exclusively in two\nforums. The statute bars jurisdiction in the CFC over a \u201cclaim for\nor in respect to which\u201d a plaintiff has a suit or process pending\nelsewhere. When Congress first enacted \u00a71500\u2019s predecessor, the\nstatute establishing the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims used\nthe term \u201cclaims\u201d to refer to demands for money damages. See Act of\nMar. 3, 1863, \u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 12 Stat. 765; seeUnited Statesv.Jones,131 U.\nS. 1, 17 (1889) (noting that the statute\u2019s provisions \u201cwere\ninconsistent with the enforcement of any claims under the law\nexcept claims for money\u201d).[Footnote\n6] Congress thus would have understood the term \u201cclaim\u201d in\n\u00a71500 to describe the particular relief sought in the Court of\nClaims. Cf.Commissionerv.Keystone Consol.\nIndustries, Inc.,508 U. S. 152, 159\n(1993).Determining the meaning of\n\u201cclaim\u201d is only part of the inquiry, however. The question remains\nwhat constitutes a suit or process \u201cfor or in respect to\u201d a CFC\nclaim. The purpose and history of the statute elucidate the meaning\nof this ambiguous phrase. As the majority explains, Congress\nenacted the statute to prevent \u201cduplicative lawsuits\u201d brought by\nthe so-called \u201ccotton claimants\u201d in the aftermath of the Civil War.Keene, 508 U. S., at 206; seeante, at 3. The\ncotton claimants sought monetary compensation for seized cotton in\nthe Court of Claims pursuant to the Abandoned Property Collection\nAct, 12 Stat. 820. Because they had difficulty satisfying the\nstatutory requirement that, to obtain compensation, they must not\nhave given aid or comfort to participants in the rebellion, see \u00a73\nof the Act, they also sought relief\u2014either in the form of money\ndamages or actual cotton\u2014in separate lawsuits against federal\nofficials on tort theories such as conversion. \u201cIt was these\nduplicative lawsuits that induced Congress\u201d to enact \u00a71500\u2019s\npredecessor.Keene, 508 U. S., at 206.This historical backdrop sheds light on what\nCongress would have understood to be a suit or process \u201cfor or in\nrespect to\u201d a \u201cclaim\u201d in the Court of Claims. Congress undoubtedly\nintended to preclude a claim for money in the Court of Claims when\nthe plaintiff was pursuing a suit \u201cfor\u201d the same money in district\ncourt. Because, however, some cotton claimants sought return of the\ncotton itself in district court, it was also necessary to preclude\njurisdiction in the Court of Claims when the plaintiff\u2019s other\naction was \u201cin respect to\u201d that demand for money\u2014i.e.,\nwhen the plaintiff was seeking duplicative relief. Had the courts\nawarded such plaintiffs both the cotton itself and money damages,\nthe plaintiffs would have obtained twice what they deserved. In\nthis way, Congress eschewed \u201ca narrow concept of identity\u201d that\nwould have permitted plaintiffs to pursue and obtain duplicative\nrelief to remedy the very same harm.Id., at 213.The legislative history confirms Congress\u2019\nintent to preclude requests for duplicative relief. The statute\u2019s\nsponsor explained that the purpose of the statute was \u201cto put to\ntheir election that large class of persons having cotton claims[,]\n\u2026 who are here at the same time endeavoring to prosecute their\nclaims, and have filed them in the Court of Claims, so that after\nthey put the Government to the expense of beating them once in a\ncourt of law they can turn around and try the whole question in the\nCourt of Claims.\u201d[Footnote 7]\nCong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 2769 (1868) (statement of Sen.\nEdmunds); see alsoMatson Nav. Co., 284 U. S., at 355\u2013356.\nCongress thus appears to have had in mind cases in which \u201cthe whole\nquestion\u201d could be tried in the Court of Claims. The statute\u2019s\nhistory does not suggest that Congress intended to require an\nelection between two nonduplicative forms of relief available\nexclusively in two different courts. In such a case, \u201cthe whole\nquestion\u201d could not be tried in either court.2None of the majority\u2019s reasons\nfor its contrary construction of the statute is convincing. First,\nthe majority reasons that the phrase \u201cclaim for or in respect to\u201d\nmust refer only to factual overlap because the statute uses the\nphrase \u201ccause of action \u2026 in respect thereto\u201d (which the majority\nparaphrases as \u201cin respect to a cause of action\u201d) in a way that is\n\u201cconsistent only with factual overlap.\u201dAnte, at 4. This\npoint rests on a misreading of the statutory text. The statute asks\nwhether a plaintiff has pending a \u201csuit or process\u201d for or in\nrespect to the plaintiff\u2019s CFC claim\u2014not whether it has pending a\n\u201ccause of action\u201d for or in respect to that claim.[Footnote 8] Even if the term \u201ccause of\naction\u201d refers only to operative facts\u2014such that the inquiry\nwhether a person was acting under color of federal law in respect\nto a cause of action is purely factual in nature\u2014a \u201csuit or\nprocess\u201d will inevitably include a request for relief.Second, the majority states that,\n\u201cin light of the unique remedial powers of the CFC,\u201d requiring\nremedial overlap would make no sense because it would result in a\n\u201cvery limited application\u201d of the statute.Ante, at 5, 6.\nHere, the majority overlooks the nearly 150-year history of the\nstatute. It was the cotton claimants\u2019 parallel requests for\nduplicative relief that prompted passage of \u00a71500 in the first\nplace. Since then, litigants have continued to seek duplicative\nrelief against the Government in two courts, asKeeneand\nthis very case illustrate. See 508 U. S., at 204\u2013205 (seeking tort\ndamages in the District Court and compensation on a takings theory\nin the CFC);supra, at 1\u20133 (seeking restitution and\ndisgorgement in the District Court and money damages in the CFC);\nsee also,e.g.,Ex parte Skinner & Eddy\nCorp.,265 U. S.\n86, 91\u201392 (1924) (seeking money damages against the United\nStates in the Court of Claims and against a federal entity in state\ncourt);Corona Coal Co.v.United States,263 U. S. 537,\n539 (1924) (seeking money damages against the United States in the\nCourt of Claims and against a federal agent in District Court);British American Tobacco Co.v.United States, 89\nCt. Cl. 438, 439\u2013440 (1939)(per curiam)(seeking tort\ndamages in the District Court and contract damages in the Court of\nClaims). As these cases make clear, interpreting \u00a71500 to prohibit\nrequests for duplicative relief hardly renders the statute of\nlimited application.Third, the majority suggests that its\nconstruction of \u00a71500 is necessary to achieve the statute\u2019s aim of\n\u201csav[ing] the Government from burdens of redundant litigation.\u201dAnte, at 7. Parallel actions seeking the same or\nduplicative relief, or different forms of relief that are available\nentirely in one court, are redundant; actions seeking different\nforms of relief that Congress has made available exclusively in\ndifferent courts are not. To the extent the majority is concerned\nabout the burdens of parallel discovery, federal courts have ample\ntools at their disposal, such as stays, to prevent such burdens.\nSee Schwartz, Section 1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits\nAgainst the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L.\u00a0J. 573, 599\n(1967).Finally, the majority contends that focusing\non operative facts is consistent with the principles of claim\npreclusion embodied in the statute. Claim preclusion ordinarily\n\u201cbar[s] claims arising from the same transaction.\u201dKremerv.Chemical Constr. Corp.,456 U. S. 461, 482,\nn.\u00a022 (1982). There is, however, an exception to this rule\nwhen a plaintiff was unable to obtain a certain remedy in the\nearlier action. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a726(1)(c)\n(1980) (claim preclusion does not apply where \u201c[t]he plaintiff was\nunable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain\nremedy or form of relief in the first action because of the\nlimitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts\u201d); see\nalsoMarresev.American Academy of Orthopaedic\nSurgeons,470\nU. S. 373, 382 (1985); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74412, p.\u00a0276 (2d ed.\n2002). This principle has long informed claim preclusion law. See,e.g., Restatement of Judgments \u00a762, Commentk(1942) (\u201c[W]here a plaintiff brings an action in a State in which\nthe courts have jurisdiction only with reference to one portion of\nhis cause of action, he is not barred from maintaining an action in\na proper court for the other portion\u201d); 2 H. Black, Law of\nJudgments \u00a7618, p.\u00a0744 (1891) (\u201cA judgment is not conclusive\nof any matter which, from the nature of the case, the form of\naction, or the character of the pleadings, could not have been\nadjudicated in the former suit\u201d). For these reasons, preclusion\ndoctrine actually undermines the majority\u2019s position.In sum, the majority offers no coherent\njustification for its conclusion that Congress intended to preclude\njurisdiction in the CFC whenever a plaintiff\u2019s claim in that court\nis based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending\nelsewhere without reference to the relief sought.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Even before today\u2019s decision,\n\u00a71500 had been described as \u201canachronistic,\u201dKeene, 508 U.\nS., at 217, \u201charsh,\u201did., at 222 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting), and \u201carbitrar[y],\u201d 79 Fed. Cl. 645, 659, n.\u00a016\n(2007). Judges and commentators have long called for congressional\nattention to the statute. See,e.g.,Keene, 508\nU. S., at 222 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Schwartz,supra,\nat 601. Today\u2019s decision\u2014which unnecessarily considers and\nrepudiates theCasmanrule\u2014renders such attention all the\nmore pressing. Under the Court\u2019s construction of \u00a71500, plaintiffs\nwhom Congress has forced to file parallel actions in the CFC and a\ndistrict court to obtain complete relief must now choose either to\nforgo relief in the district court or to file first in the district\ncourt and risk the expiration of the statute of limitations on\ntheir claims in the CFC. I cannot agree that Congress intended, or\nintends, for \u00a71500 to produce this result. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully concur only in the judgment.Footnote 1The majority characterizes the Nation\u2019s\nDistrict Court complaint as seeking \u201cequitable relief,\u201dante, at 2, but does not mention that the complaint seeks,\namong other things, equitablemonetaryrelief such as\ndisgorgement and restitution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a.Footnote 2In reaching the opposite conclusion, the\nCourt of Appeals relied on the fact that the Nation\u2019s District\nCourt complaint seeks equitable relief whereas its CFC complaint\nseeks damages. See 559 F.\u00a03d 1284, 1288\u20131289 (CA Fed. 2009).Keenemakes clear, however, that actions based on\nsubstantially the same operative facts implicate \u00a71500 so long as\nthey seek overlapping relief. SeeKeene Corp.v.United States,508 U. S. 200, 212 (1993). The formal\nlabel affixed to the form of relief sought is irrelevant. In this\ncase, both the Nation\u2019s CFC complaint and its District Court\ncomplaint seek money to remedy the Government\u2019s alleged failure to\nkeep accurate accounts.Footnote 3The majority does not contend that the facts\nof this case require it to decide this question. It justifies its\ndecision to reach the question on the ground that its rule would\neliminate \u201can unnecessary and complicated remedial inquiry\u201d and\nwould decrease \u201cthe expense and duration of litigation.\u201dAnte, at 9. It provides no reason to believe, however,\nthat inquiry into relief requested is unduly complicated in the\nvast majority of cases. Cf.Loveladies Harbor, Inc.v.United States, 27 F.\u00a03d 1545, 1552 (CA Fed. 1994) (en\nbanc) (\u201cThe principles ofCasman[v.United\nStates, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956)] \u2026 are not that difficult to\ncomprehend or apply\u201d). More importantly, the majority does not\nexplain why the benefits it perceives to result from deciding this\nquestion today outweigh the potential for its reading of the\nstatute to leave some plaintiffs with incomplete recompense for\ntheir injuries. Seeinfra, this page and 5\u20136.Footnote 4Congress has since enacted legislation to\npermit plaintiffs in Casman\u2019s situation to obtain complete relief\nin the CFC. See Act of Aug. 29, 1972, \u00a71, 86 Stat. 652, 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71491(a)(2) (permitting the CFC to \u201cissue orders\ndirecting restoration to office or position, placement in\nappropriate duty or retirement status, and correction of applicable\nrecords\u201d).Footnote 5The majority apparently doubts that its\nholding puts the Nation to a similarly difficult choice. It first\nsuggests that the Nation could file solely in the CFC to obtain\ndamages for the Government\u2019s alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.\nSeeante, at 8. The Nation could indeed choose to file\nonly in the CFC\u2014just as any plaintiff could choose to forgo\ninjunctive relief to pursue money damages in the CFC\u2014but the Nation\nbelieves it is entitled to more than monetary relief. The Nation\u2019s\nDistrict Court action seeks an equitable accounting to remedy the\nsame breaches of fiduciary duty, and the CFC has held that it lacks\njurisdiction to issue a preliability accounting. SeeKlamathand Modoc Tribesv.United\nStates, 174 Ct. Cl. 483, 487\u2013488, 490 (1966). But seeEastern Shawnee Tribe of Okla.v.United States,\n582 F.\u00a03d 1306, 1308 (CA Fed. 2009) (suggesting in dicta that\nthe CFC can order an equitable accounting as \u201cancillary relief\u201d\nunder 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71491(a)(2) and (b)(2)), cert. pending, No.\n09\u20131521.The majority next suggests that Congress has\ntolled the statute of limitations governing the Nation\u2019s CFC\nclaims. Seeante, at 8\u20139. But the cited statute only\napplies to claims \u201cconcerning losses to or mismanagement of trust\nfunds.\u201d 123 Stat. 2922. It does not appear to toll the statute of\nlimitations for claims concerning assets other than funds, such as\ntangible assets. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a\u201369a (seeking\ndamages for the Government\u2019s mismanagement of the Nation\u2019s mineral\nestates). Expiration of the 6-year statute of limitations governing\nclaims in the CFC is a very real prospect in this and other cases;\nthe Nation\u2019s District Court action has been pending for more than\nfour years.As the majority notes, seeante, at\n6\u20137, the validity of the Court of Claims\u2019 holding inTecon\nEngineers, Inc.v.United States, 170 Ct. Cl. 389,\n343 F.\u00a02d 943 (1965), is not presented in this case. This\nCourt has never considered that holding. Accordingly, I do not\nconsider whether the Nation could have avoided application of \u00a71500\naltogether by filing its CFC action first.Footnote 6Congress has consistently used the term\n\u201cclaim\u201d to refer to a demand for money in the context of the CFC.\nSee 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491(a)(1) (conferring jurisdiction in the\nCFC over \u201canyclaimagainst the United States founded\neither upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any\nregulation of an executive department, or upon any express or\nimplied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or\nunliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Of course, since \u00a71500\u2019s enactment, Congress has\nauthorized the CFC to issue relief other than money damages in\ncertain cases. See \u00a71491(a)(2).Footnote 7Because \u00a71500\u2019s jurisdictional bar applies\nonly when the other suit is pending, \u201cthere is a good argument\nthat, even when first enacted, the statute did not actually perform\nthe preclusion function emphasized by its sponsor.\u201dKeene,\n508 U. S., at 217.Footnote 8Section 1500 refers to the \u201ccause of action\nalleged in such suit or process\u201d only for the limited purpose of\ndetermining whether the other suit or process is against an agent\nof the United States. When the plaintiff\u2019s other action is against\nthe United States itself, the term \u201ccause of action\u201d has no\nrelevance to the \u00a71500 inquiry.",
