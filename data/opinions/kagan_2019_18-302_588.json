Although split between two\nnon-majority opinions, all Members of the Court agreed that the\nprovision violated the First Amendment because it discriminated on\nthe basis of viewpoint. Today we consider a First Amendment\nchallenge to a neighboring provision of the Act, prohibiting the\nregistration of \u201cimmoral[\u00a0] or scandalous\u201d trademarks.Ibid.We hold that this provision infringes the First\nAmendment for the same reason: It too disfavors certain ideas.IRespondent Erik Brunetti is an artist and\nentrepreneur who founded a clothing line that uses the trademark\nFUCT. According to Brunetti, the mark (which functions as the\nclothing\u2019s brand name) is pronounced as four letters, one after the\nother: F-U-C-T. See Brief for Respondent 1. But you might read it\ndifferently and, if so, you would hardly be alone. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 5 (describing the brand name as \u201cthe equivalent of [the] past\nparticiple form of a well-known word of profanity\u201d). That common\nperception caused difficulties for Brunetti when he tried to\nregister his mark with the U.\u00a0S. Patent and Trademark Office\n(PTO).Under the Lanham Act, the PTO administers a\nfederal registration system for trademarks. See 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71051, 1052. Registration of a mark is not\nmandatory. The owner of an unregistered mark may still use it in\ncommerce and enforce it against infringers. SeeTam, 582\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). But registration gives\ntrademark owners valuable benefits. For example, registration\nconstitutes \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of the mark\u2019s validity.\n\u00a71115(a). And registration serves as \u201cconstructive notice of the\nregistrant\u2019s claim of ownership,\u201d which forecloses some defenses in\ninfringement actions. \u00a71072. Generally, a trademark is eligible for\nregistration, and receipt of such benefits, if it is \u201cused in\ncommerce.\u201d \u00a71051(a)(1). But the Act directs the PTO to\n\u201crefuse[\u00a0] registration\u201d of certain marks. \u00a71052. For\ninstance, the PTO cannot register a mark that \u201cso resembles\u201d\nanother mark as to create a likelihood of confusion. \u00a71052(d). It\ncannot register a mark that is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the goods on\nwhich it is used. \u00a71052(e). It cannot register a mark containing\nthe flag or insignia of any nation or State. See \u00a71052(b). There\nare five or ten more (depending on how you count). And until we\ninvalidated the criterion two years ago, the PTO could not register\na mark that \u201cdisparage[d]\u201d a \u201cperson[\u00a0], living or dead.\u201d\n\u00a71052(a); seeTam, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___.This case involves another of the Lanham Act\u2019s\nprohibitions on registration\u2014one applying to marks that\n\u201c[c]onsist[\u00a0] of or comprise[\u00a0] immoral[\u00a0] or\nscandalous matter.\u201d \u00a71052(a). The PTO applies that bar as a\n\u201cunitary provision,\u201d rather than treating the two adjectives in it\nseparately.In\u00a0re Brunetti, 877 F.3d 1330, 1336 (CA\nFed. 2017); Brief for Petitioner 6 (stating that the PTO \u201chas long\ntreated the two terms as composing a single category\u201d). To\ndetermine whether a mark fits in the category, the PTO asks whether\na \u201csubstantial composite of the general public\u201d would find the mark\n\u201cshocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety\u201d; \u201cgiving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings\u201d; \u201ccalling out for\ncondemnation\u201d; \u201cdisgraceful\u201d; \u201coffensive\u201d; \u201cdisreputable\u201d; or\n\u201cvulgar.\u201d 877 F.\u00a03d, at 1336 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Brief for Petitioner 6 (agreeing that the PTO\n\u201cgenerally defines\u201d the category in that way).Both a PTO examining attorney and the PTO\u2019s\nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board decided that Brunetti\u2019s mark\nflunked that test. The attorney determined that FUCT was \u201ca total\nvulgar\u201d and \u201ctherefore[\u00a0] unregistrable.\u201d App. 27\u201328. On\nreview, the Board stated that the mark was \u201chighly offensive\u201d and\n\u201cvulgar,\u201d and that it had \u201cdecidedly negative sexual connotations.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, 64a\u201365a. As part of its review, the\nBoard also considered evidence of how Brunetti used the mark. It\nfound that Brunetti\u2019s website and products contained imagery, near\nthe mark, of \u201cextreme nihilism\u201d and \u201canti-social\u201d behavior.Id.,at 64a. In that context, the Board thought, the mark\ncommunicated \u201cmisogyny, depravity, [and] violence.\u201dIbid.\nThe Board concluded: \u201cWhether one considers [the mark] as a sexual\nterm, or finds that [Brunetti] has used [the mark] in the context\nof extreme misogyny, nihilism or violence, we have no question but\nthat [the term is] extremely offensive.\u201dId.,at 65a.Brunetti then brought a facial challenge to the\n\u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d bar in the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit. That court found the prohibition to violate the First\nAmendment. As usual when a lower court has invalidated a federal\nstatute, we granted certiorari. 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).IIThis Court first considered a First Amendment\nchallenge to a trademark registration restriction inTam,\njust two Terms ago. There, the Court declared unconstitutional the\nLanham Act\u2019s ban on registering marks that \u201cdisparage\u201d any\n\u201cperson[\u00a0], living or dead.\u201d \u00a71052(a). The eight-Justice Court\ndivided evenly between two opinions and could not agree on the\noverall framework for deciding the case. (In particular, no\nmajority emerged to resolve whether a Lanham Act bar is a condition\non a government benefit or a simple restriction on speech.) But all\nthe Justices agreed on two propositions. First, if a trademark\nregistration bar is viewpoint-based, it is unconstitutional. See\n582 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___, ___\u2013___ (opinion of Alito, J.) (slip\nop., at 1\u20132, 22\u201323);id.,at ___\u2013___, ___ (opinion of\nKennedy, J.) (slip op., at 1\u20132, 5). And second, the disparagement\nbar was viewpoint-based. Seeid.,at ___\u2013___, ___\u2013___\n(opinion of Alito, J.) (slip op., at 1\u20132, 22\u201323);id.,at\n___\u2013___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 2\u20135).The Justices thus found common ground in a core\npostulate of free speech law: The government may not discriminate\nagainst speech based on the ideas or opinions it conveys. SeeRosenbergerv.Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,515 U.S.\n819, 829\u2013830 (1995) (explaining that viewpoint discrimination\nis an \u201cegregious form of content discrimination\u201d and is\n\u201cpresumptively unconstitutional\u201d). In Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nexplanation, the disparagement bar allowed a trademark owner to\nregister a mark if it was \u201cpositive\u201d about a person, but not if it\nwas \u201cderogatory.\u201dTam, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2). That was the \u201cessence of viewpoint discrimination,\u201d he\ncontinued, because \u201c[t]he law thus reflects the Government\u2019s\ndisapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 2\u20133). Justice Alito emphasized\nthat the statute \u201cdenie[d] registration to any mark\u201d whose\ndisparaging message was \u201coffensive to a substantial percentage of\nthe members of any group.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 22).\nThe bar thus violated the \u201cbedrock First Amendment principle\u201d that\nthe government cannot discriminate against \u201cideas that offend.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 1\u20132). Slightly different\nexplanations, then, but a shared conclusion: Viewpoint\ndiscrimination doomed the disparagement bar.If the \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d bar similarly\ndiscriminates on the basis of viewpoint, it must also collide with\nour First Amendment doctrine. The Government does not argue\notherwise. In briefs and oral argument, the Government offers a\ntheory for upholding the bar if it is viewpoint-neutral\n(essentially, that the bar would then be a reasonable condition on\na government benefit). See Brief for Petitioner 14\u201326. But the\nGovernment agrees that underTamit may not \u201cdeny\nregistration based on the views expressed\u201d by a mark. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 24. \u201cAs the Court\u2019sTamdecision establishes,\u201d the\nGovernment says, \u201cthe criteria for federal trademark registration\u201d\nmust be \u201cviewpoint-neutral to survive Free Speech Clause review.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. 19. So the key question becomes: Is the \u201cimmoral or\nscandalous\u201d criterion in the Lanham Act viewpoint-neutral or\nviewpoint-based?It is viewpoint-based. The meanings of \u201cimmoral\u201d\nand \u201cscandalous\u201d are not mysterious, but resort to some\ndictionaries still helps to lay bare the problem. When is\nexpressive material \u201cimmoral\u201d? According to a standard definition,\nwhen it is \u201cinconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals\u201d;\n\u201cwicked\u201d; or \u201cvicious.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1246\n(2d ed. 1949). Or again, when it is \u201copposed to or violating\nmorality\u201d; or \u201cmorally evil.\u201d Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 961\n(3d ed. 1947). So the Lanham Act permits registration of marks that\nchampion society\u2019s sense of rectitude and morality, but not marks\nthat denigrate those concepts. And when is such material\n\u201cscandalous\u201d? Says a typical definition, when it \u201cgiv[es] offense\nto the conscience or moral feelings\u201d; \u201cexcite[s] reprobation\u201d; or\n\u201ccall[s] out condemnation.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary,\nat 2229. Or again, when it is \u201cshocking to the sense of truth,\ndecency, or propriety\u201d; \u201cdisgraceful\u201d; \u201coffensive\u201d; or\n\u201cdisreputable.\u201d Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 2186\n(1944). So the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their\nmessages accord with, but not when their messages defy, society\u2019s\nsense of decency or propriety. Put the pair of overlapping terms\ntogether and the statute, on its face, distinguishes between two\nopposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional moral\nstandards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal nods\nof approval and those provoking offense and condemnation. The\nstatute favors the former, and disfavors the latter. \u201cLove rules\u201d?\n\u201cAlways be good\u201d? Registration follows. \u201cHate rules\u201d? \u201cAlways be\ncruel\u201d? Not according to the Lanham Act\u2019s \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d\nbar.The facial viewpoint bias in the law results in\nviewpoint-discriminatory application. Recall that the PTO itself\ndescribes the \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d criterion using much the same\nlanguage as in the dictionary definitions recited above. Seesupra,at 3. The PTO, for example, asks whether the public\nwould view the mark as \u201cshocking to the sense of truth, decency, or\npropriety\u201d; \u201ccalling out for condemnation\u201d; \u201coffensive\u201d; or\n\u201cdisrepu- table.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Using those guideposts, the PTO has refused to register\nmarks communicating \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cscandalous\u201d views about (among\nother things) drug use, religion, and terrorism. But all the while,\nit has approved registration of marks expressing more accepted\nviews on the same topics. See generally Gilson & LaLonde,\nTrademarks Laid Bare, 101 Trademark Reporter 1476, 1510\u20131513,\n1518\u20131522 (2011); Brief for Barton Beebe et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae28\u201329.Here are some samples. The PTO rejected marks\nconveying approval of drug use (YOU CAN\u2019T SPELL HEALTHCARE WITHOUT\nTHC for pain-relief medication, MARIJUANA COLA and KO KANE for\nbeverages) because it is scandalous to \u201cinappropriately glamoriz[e]\ndrug abuse.\u201d PTO, Office Action of Aug. 28, 2010, Serial No.\n85038867; see Office Action of Dec. 24, 2009, Serial No. 77833964;\nOffice Action of Nov. 17, 2009, Serial No. 77671304. But at the\nsame time, the PTO registered marks with such sayings as D.A.R.E.\nTO RESIST DRUGS AND VIOLENCE and SAY NO TO DRUGS\u2014REALITY IS THE\nBEST TRIP IN LIFE. See PTO, Reg. No. 2975163 (July 26, 2005); Reg.\nNo. 2966019 (July 12, 2005). Similarly, the PTO disapproved\nregistration for the mark BONG HITS 4 JESUS because it \u201csuggests\nthat people should engage in an illegal activity [in connection\nwith] worship\u201d and because \u201cChristians would be morally outraged by\na statement that connects Jesus Christ with illegal drug use.\u201d\nOffice Action of Mar. 15, 2008, Serial No. 77305946. And the PTO\nrefused to register trademarks associating religious references\nwith products (AGNUS DEI for safes and MADONNA for wine) because\nthey would be \u201coffensive to most individuals of the Christian\nfaith\u201d and \u201cshocking to the sense of propriety.\u201dEx parte Summit\nBrass & Bronze Works, 59 USPQ 22, 23 (Dec. Com. Pat. 1943);In re Riverbank Canning Co., 95 F.2d 327, 329 (CCPA 1938).\nBut once again, the PTO approved marks\u2014PRAISE THE LORD for a game\nand JESUS DIED FOR YOU on clothing\u2014whose message suggested\nreligious faith rather than blasphemy or irreverence. See Reg. No.\n5265121 (Aug. 15, 2017); Reg. No. 3187985 (Dec. 19, 2006). Finally,\nthe PTO rejected marks reflecting support for al-Qaeda (BABY AL\nQAEDA and AL-QAEDA on t-shirts) \u201cbecause the bombing of civilians\nand other terrorist acts are shocking to the sense of decency and\ncall out for condemnation.\u201d Office Action of Nov. 22, 2004, Serial\nNo. 78444968; see Office Action of Feb. 23, 2005, Serial No.\n78400213. Yet it approved registration of a mark with the words WAR\nON TERROR MEMORIAL. Reg. No. 5495362 (Jun. 19, 2018). Of course,\nall these decisions are understandable. The rejected marks express\nopinions that are, at the least, offensive to many Americans. But\nas the Court made clear inTam, a law disfavoring \u201cideas\nthat offend\u201d discriminates based on viewpoint, in violation of the\nFirst Amendment. 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.)\n(slip op., at 2); seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 22\u201323);id.,at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at\n2\u20133).How, then, can the Government claim that the\n\u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d bar is viewpoint-neutral? The Government\nbasically asks us to treat decisions like those described above as\nPTO examiners\u2019 mistakes. See Brief for Petitioner 46. Still more,\nthe Government tells us to ignore how the Lanham Act\u2019s language, on\nits face, disfavors some ideas. In urging that course, the\nGovernment does not dispute that the statutory language\u2014and words\nused to define it\u2014have just that effect. At oral argument, the\nGovernment conceded: \u201c[I]f you just looked at the words like\n\u2018shocking\u2019 and \u2018offensive\u2019 on their face and gave them their\nordinary meanings[,] they could easily encompass material that was\nshocking [or offensive] because it expressed an outrageous point of\nview or a point of view that most members\u201d of society reject. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 6. But no matter, says the Government, because the\nstatute is \u201csusceptible of\u201d a limiting construction that would\nremove this viewpoint bias.Id.,at 7 (arguing that the\nCourt should \u201cattempt to construe [the] statute in a way that would\nrender it constitutional\u201d). The Government\u2019s idea, abstractly\nphrased, is to narrow the statutory bar to \u201cmarks that are\noffensive [or] shocking to a substantial segment of the public\nbecause of theirmodeof expression, independent of any\nviews that they may express.\u201dId.,at 11 (emphasis added);\nsee Brief for Petitioner 27\u201328. More concretely, the Government\nexplains that this reinterpretation would mostly restrict the PTO\nto refusing marks that are \u201cvulgar\u201d\u2014meaning \u201clewd,\u201d \u201csexually\nexplicit or profane.\u201dId.,at 27, 30. Such a reconfigured\nbar, the Government says, would not turn on viewpoint, and so we\ncould uphold it.But we cannot accept the Government\u2019s proposal,\nbecause the statute says something markedly different. This Court,\nof course, may interpret \u201cambiguous statutory language\u201d to \u201cavoid\nserious constitutional doubts.\u201dFCCv.Fox Television\nStations, Inc.,556 U.S.\n502, 516 (2009). But that canon of construction applies only\nwhen ambiguity exists. \u201cWe will not rewrite a law to conform it to\nconstitutional requirements.\u201dUnited Statesv.Stevens,559 U.S.\n460, 481 (2010) (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). So even assuming the Government\u2019s reading would eliminate\nFirst Amendment problems, we may adopt it only if we can see it in\nthe statutory language. And we cannot. The \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d\nbar stretches far beyond the Government\u2019s proposed construction.\nThe statute as written does not draw the line at lewd, sexually\nexplicit, or profane marks. Nor does it refer only to marks whose\n\u201cmode of expression,\u201d independent of viewpoint, is particularly\noffensive. Brief for Petitioner 28 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It covers the universe of immoral or scandalous\u2014or (to\nuse some PTO synonyms) offensive or disreputable\u2014material. Whether\nor not lewd or profane. Whether the scandal and immorality comes\nfrom mode or instead from viewpoint. To cut the statute off where\nthe Government urges is not to interpret the statute Congress\nenacted, but to fashion a new one.[1]*And once the \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d bar is\ninterpreted fairly, it must be invalidated. The Government just\nbarely argues otherwise. In the last paragraph of its brief, the\nGovernment gestures toward the idea that the provision is\nsalvageable by virtue of its constitutionally permissible\napplications (in the Government\u2019s view, its applications to lewd,\nsexually explicit, or profane marks). Seeid., at 47. In\nother words, the Government invokes our First Amendment overbreadth\ndoctrine, and asks us to uphold the statute against facial attack\nbecause its unconstitutional applications are not \u201csubstantial\u201d\nrelative to \u201cthe statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201dStevens, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 473 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But to begin with, this Court has never applied that kind\nof analysis to a viewpoint-discriminatory law. InTam, for\nexample, we did not pause to consider whether the disparagement\nclause might admit some permissible applications (say, to certain\nlibelous speech) before striking it down. The Court\u2019s finding of\nviewpoint bias ended the matter. And similarly, it seems unlikely\nwe would compare permissible and impermissible applications if\nCongress outright banned \u201coffensive\u201d (or to use some other\nexamples, \u201cdivisive\u201d or \u201csubversive\u201d) speech. Once we have found\nthat a law \u201caim[s] at the suppression of\u00a0\u201d views, why would it\nmatter that Congress could have captured some of the same speech\nthrough a viewpoint-neutral statute?Tam, 582 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 2). But in any event,\nthe \u201cimmoral or scandalous\u201d bar is substantially overbroad. There\nare a great many immoral and scandalous ideas in the world (even\nmore than there are swearwords), and the Lanham Act covers them\nall. It therefore violates the First Amendment.We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals.It is so ordered.Notes1*We reject the dissent\u2019s\nstatutory surgery for the same reason. Al-though conceding that the\nterm \u201cimmoral\u201d cannot be saved, the dissent thinks that the term\n\u201cscandalous\u201d can be read as the Government proposes. Seepost,at 1\u20132 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). But that term is not \u201cambiguous,\u201d as the\ndissent argues,post,at 3; it is just broad. Remember that\nthe dictionaries define it to mean offensive, disreputable,\nexciting reprobation, and so forth. Seesupra,at 5\u20136;post,at 3 (accepting those definitions). Even if hived off\nfrom \u201cimmoral\u201d marks, the category of scandalous marks thus\nincludesbothmarks that offend by the ideas they conveyandmarks that offend by their mode of expression. And its\ncoverage of the former means that it discriminates based on\nviewpoint. We say nothing at all about a statute that covers only\nthe latter\u2014or, in the Government\u2019s more concrete description, a\nstatute limited to lewd, sexually explicit, and profane marks. Nor\ndo we say anything about how to evaluate viewpoint-neutral\nrestrictions on trademark registration, seepost,at\n14\u201317\u2014because the \u201cscandalous\u201d bar (whether or not attached to the\n\u201cimmoral\u201d bar) is not one.",
