    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u20135410_________________CHARLES BORDEN, Jr., PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 10, 2021]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.This case forces us to choose between\naggravating a past error and committing a new one. I must choose\nthe former. Although I am \u201creluctant to magnify the burdens that\nour [erroneous] jurisprudence imposes,\u201dRingv.Arizona,536 U.S.\n584, 610 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring), I conclude that the\nparticular provision at issue here does not encompass petitioner\u2019s\nconviction for reckless aggravated assault, even though the\nconsequences of today\u2019s judgment are at odds with the larger\nstatutory scheme. The need to make this choice is yet another\nconsequence of the Court\u2019s vagueness-doctrine cases likeJohnsonv.United States, 576 U.S. 591 (2015).IThe Armed Career Criminal Act provides\nenhanced penalties for criminals convicted of certain firearms\noffenses who have at least \u201cthree previous convictions\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1). As relevant here, the Act defines a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d as a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year\u201d that either \u201chas as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another\u201d (the elements clause) or \u201cinvolves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d\n(the residual clause). \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).[1]The question presented here is whether the\nelements clause encompasses petitioner\u2019s conviction under Tennessee\nlaw for reckless aggravated assault. It does not. The plurality\nfocuses on the latter part of the operative language: \u201cagainst the\nperson of another.\u201d I rest my analysis instead on a separate\nphrase: \u201cuse of physical force.\u201d As I have explained before, a\ncrime that can be committed through mere recklessness does not have\nas an element the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d because that phrase \u201chas\na well-understood meaning applying only to intentional acts\ndesigned to cause harm.\u201dVoisinev.United States,\n579 U.S. 686, ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2, 16). The elements clause does not encompass petitioner\u2019s\nconviction because the statute under which he was convicted could\nbe violated through mere recklessness.But although the Court\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioner\u2019s conviction does not satisfy the elements clause is\nsound, the implication that he is something other than an \u201carmed\ncareer criminal\u201d is not. The state law here prohibits \u201c[r]ecklessly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [c]aus[ing] serious bodily injury to another.\u201d\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u201313\u2013102(a)(2)(A) (2003). That offense would\nsatisfy the residual clause because it \u201cinvolves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). So although the elements clause does not make\npetitioner an armed career criminal, the residual clause would.The problem is thatJohnsonheld that the\nresidual clause is \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d and thus\nunenforceable. 576 U.\u00a0S., at 597. This left prosecutors and\ncourts in a bind. Many offenders had committed violent felonies,\nbutJohnsonforeclosed invoking the residual clause to\nestablish that fact. The workaround was to read the elements clause\nbroadly. But the text of that clause cannot bear such a broad\nreading.IIThere is a straightforward solution to this\ndilemma\u2014overruleJohnson.[2]Johnsondeclared the residual clause not just\ntoo vague as applied in that case but also facially vague\u2014meaning\nthat the residual clause could never be employed consistent with\nthe Constitution. That decision was wrong for at least two\nreasons.First, to \u201cpronounce that the statute is\nunconstitutional inallapplications .\u00a0.\u00a0. seems\nto me no more than an advisory opinion\u2014which a federal court should\nnever issue at all.\u201dChicagov.Morales,527 U.S.\n41, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Courts have no\nauthority to \u201c\u00a0\u2018strik[e] down\u2019\u00a0\u201d statutory text. SeeUnited Statesv.Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6); see also\nMitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 933,\n936 (2018). Nor may courts resolve \u201cgeneral questions of legality\u201d\nby \u201cprovid[ing] relief beyond the parties to the case.\u201dTrumpv.Hawaii, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___ (2018)\n(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6, 8). A court may only\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual\ncontroversies.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited Statesv.Raines,362 U.S.\n17, 21 (1960). When faced with a criminal statute too vague for\nthe case at hand, the right answer likely is to apply the rule of\nlenity and \u201cdeclin[e] to apply [the statute] on a case-by-case\nbasis.\u201dSessionsv.Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4). By, instead,\npurporting to decide theoretical cases for theoretical parties not\nbefore the Court,Johnsondeparted from foundational limits\non the judicial power.Second, even assuming that the petitioner\u2019s plea\nfor facial relief was cognizable,Johnsondeviated from the\nusual legal standard. To obtain facial relief, a plaintiff normally\n\u201cmust establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the\nAct would be valid.\u201dE.g.,United Statesv.Salerno,481 U.S.\n739, 745 (1987). That is because a facial challenge, if\nsuccessful, has the same effect as \u201cnullify[ing]\u201d a statute.Ayottev.Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,546 U.S.\n320, 329 (2006). The petitioner inJohnsondid not\nsatisfy that standard. Indeed, theJohnsonmajority\nacknowledged that \u201cthere will be straightforward cases under the\nresidual clause, because some crimes clearly pose a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n602.These errors show that this Court inJohnsonnot only misapplied the Due Process Clause but also\nexercised the legislative role. Legislatures alone have authority\n\u201cto prescribe general rules for the government of society.\u201dFletcherv.Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810). Courts, by\ncontrast, have authority to provide only those \u201cremed[ies that are]\ntailored to redress the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s particular injury.\u201dGillv.Whitford, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018)\n(slip op., at 21). Simply put, where enforcement of a law would\nconflict with the Constitution, a court has authority under the\nSupremacy Clause to enjoin enforcement, but a court cannot,\nconsistent with separation of powers, enjoin enforcement of a\nstatute where enforcement would be lawful.Johnson, however,\nconducted the \u201cquintessentially legislative work\u201d of altering the\nlegal rules that would apply in cases where the residual clause\ncould lawfully be enforced. SeePlanned Parenthood of Northern\nNew Eng., 546 U.\u00a0S., at 329\u2013330.IIII hesitate to give petitioner the benefit ofJohnson, because his crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as Congress\ndefined the term. Indeed, in other contexts, I have resisted\nexacerbating similar errors. SeePepperv.United\nStates,562 U.S.\n476, 518\u2013520 (2011) (dissenting opinion) (declining to apply\nthis Court\u2019s erroneous holding that the Sentencing Guidelines are\nnever mandatory). Yet I reluctantly conclude that I must acceptJohnsonin this case because to do otherwise would create\nfurther confusion and division about whether state laws prohibiting\nreckless assault satisfy the elements clause.[3] SeeVancev.Ball State Univ.,570 U.S.\n421, 450\u2013451 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring). I therefore\nconcur in the judgment.Notes1The definition also covers any\nfelony that \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion\u201d or \u201cinvolves use of\nexplosives.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).2Johnsonhas\nalready upended many statutes.United Statesv.Davis, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019);Sessionsv.Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018);Welchv.United\nStates, 578 U.S. 120 (2016) (makingJohnsonretroactive). And the parties agree that more are likely to\nfollow.3Voting to affirm\npetitioner\u2019s sentence here would lead to a 5 to 4 judgment that\npetitioner\u2019s sentence is correct even though five Justices conclude\nthat Tennessee reckless aggravated assault does not satisfy the\nelements clause. That kind of fractured reasoning would be\ndifficult for lower courts to apply.",
