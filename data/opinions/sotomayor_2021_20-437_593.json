He later returned to the United\nStates and was indicted on one count of unlawful reentry in\nviolation of 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71326(a). Between\nPalomar-Santiago\u2019s removal and indictment, this Court held that\noffenses like his DUI conviction do not in fact render noncitizens\nremovable. Palomar-Santiago now seeks to defend against his\nunlawful-reentry charge by challenging the validity of his 1998\nremoval order.By statute, defendants \u201cmay not\u201d bring such\ncollateral attacks \u201cunless\u201d they \u201cdemonstrat[e]\u201d that (1) they\n\u201cexhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available\nto seek relief against the [removal] order,\u201d (2) the removal\nproceedings \u201cimproperly deprived [them] of the opportunity for\njudicial review,\u201d and (3) \u201centry of the order was fundamentally\nunfair.\u201d \u00a71326(d).The question for the Court is whether\nPalomar-Santiago is excused from making the first two of these\nshowings, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held,\nbecause his prior removal order was premised on a conviction that\nwas later found not to be a removable offense. The Court holds that\nthe statute does not permit such an exception.IAForeign nationals may be removed from the\nUnited States if they are convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Among the offenses that\nqualify as aggravated felonies are \u201ccrime[s] of violence\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least\none year.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(F). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes\n\u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or\nthreatened use of physical force against the person or property of\nanother.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a).Noncitizens facing removal generally receive a\nhearing before an immigration judge. Noncitizens can proffer\ndefenses at that hearing, including that the conviction identified\nin the charging document is not a removable offense. If\nunsuccessful, they may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n(BIA). See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71229a(c)(5); 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71003.1(b),\n(d)(3), 1240.15 (2021). If unsuccessful again, they can seek review\nof the BIA\u2019s decision before a federal court of appeals. See 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(47), 1252.Once a noncitizen is removed, it is a crime to\nreturn to the United States without authorization. \u00a71326(a). The\nstatute criminalizing unlawful reentry did not originally allow\ndefendants to raise the invalidity of their underlying removal\norders as an affirmative defense. This Court later held, however,\nthat the statute \u201cdoes not comport with the constitutional\nrequirement of due process\u201d insofar as it \u201cimpose[s] a criminal\npenalty for reentry afteranydeportation, regardless of how\nviolative of the rights of the [noncitizen] the deportation\nproceeding may have been.\u201dUnited Statesv.Mendoza-Lopez,481\nU.S. 828, 837 (1987). \u201c[A]t a minimum,\u201d \u201ca collateral challenge\nto the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal\noffense must be permitted where the deportation proceeding\neffectively eliminates the right of the [noncitizen] to obtain\njudicial review.\u201dId., at 839.Congress responded by enacting \u00a71326(d). See\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\u00a7441, 110Stat. 1279. Entitled \u201cLimitation on collateral attack on\nunderlying deportation order,\u201d \u00a71326(d) establishes three\nprerequisites that defendants facing unlawful-reentry charges must\nsatisfy before they can challenge their original removal orders.\nThe statute provides:\u201cIn a criminal proceeding under this section,\nan alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. unless the alien demonstrates that\u2014\u201c(1) the alien exhausted any administrative\nremedies that may have been available to seek relief against the\norder;\u201c(2) the deportation proceedings at which the\norder was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity\nfor judicial review; and\u201c(3) the entry of the order was fundamentally\nunfair.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71326(d).BPalomar-Santiago is a Mexican national who\nobtained permanent resident status in 1990. The following year, he\nwas convicted in California state court of a felony DUI. In 1998,\nPalomar-Santiago received a Notice to Appear from the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service stating that he was subject to removal\nbecause his DUI offense was an aggravated felony. Following a\nhearing, an immigration judge ordered Palomar-Santiago\u2019s removal on\nthat ground. Palomar-Santiago waived his right to appeal and was\nremoved to Mexico the next day.Six years later, this Court held inLeocalv.Ashcroft,543 U.S. 1(2004), that \u201ca highermens reathan the merely accidental\nor negligent conduct involved in a DUI offense\u201d is necessary for an\noffense to qualify as a crime of violence.Id.,at 11.\nAccordingly, Palomar-Santiago\u2019s DUI conviction was not a crime of\nviolence under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a), and so not an\naggravated felony under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43).\nPalomar-Santiago\u2019s removal order thus never should have issued. SeeRiversv.Roadway Express, Inc.,511 U.S.\n298, 312\u2013313 (1994) (\u201cA judicial construction of a statute is\nan authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well\nas after the decision of the case giving rise to that\nconstruction\u201d).In 2017, Palomar-Santiago was found again living\nin the United States. A grand jury indicted him on one count of\nunlawful reentry after removal. Palomar-Santiago moved to dismiss\nthe indictment on the ground that his prior removal order was\ninvalid in light ofLeocal. The District Court granted the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n813 Fed. Appx. 282 (2002).Both courts were bound by Ninth Circuit\nprecedent providing that defendants are \u201cexcused from proving the\nfirst two requirements\u201d of \u00a71326(d) if they were \u201cnot convicted of\nan offense that made [them] removable.\u201dUnited Statesv.Ochoa, 861 F.3d 1010, 1015 (2017). Other Courts of Appeals\ndo not excuse similarly situated unlawful-reentry defendants from\nmeeting \u00a71326(d)\u2019s first two requirements.[1] This Court granted certiorari to resolve this\ndisagreement. 592 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2021).IIThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation is\nincompatible with the text of \u00a71326(d). That section provides that\ndefendants charged with unlawful reentry \u201cmay not\u201d challenge their\nunderlying removal orders \u201cunless\u201d they \u201cdemonstrat[e]\u201d that three\nconditions are met: (1) they have \u201cexhausted any administrative\nremedies,\u201d (2) they were \u201cdeprived .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the\nopportunity for judicial review,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe entry of the order\nwas fundamentally unfair.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71326(d). The\nrequirements are connected by the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d meaning\ndefendants must meet all three. When Congress uses \u201cmandatory\nlanguage\u201d in an administrative exhaustion provision, \u201ca court may\nnot excuse a failure to exhaust.\u201dRossv.Blake, 578\nU.S. 632, 639 (2016). Yet that is what the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule\ndoes.Without the benefit of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nextrastatutory exception, \u00a71326(d)\u2019s first two procedural\nrequirements are not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable.\nIndeed, the substantive validity of the removal order is quite\ndistinct from whether the noncitizen exhausted his administrative\nremedies (by appealing the immigration judge\u2019s decision to the BIA)\nor was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review (by filing a\npetition for review of a BIA decision with a Federal Court of\nAppeals).IIIPalomar-Santiago raises two counterarguments\nbased on the text of \u00a71326(d).[2] Neither is persuasive. First, he contends that further\nadministrative review of a removal order is not \u201cavailable\u201d when an\nimmigration judge erroneously informs a noncitizen that his prior\nconviction renders him removable. Noncitizens, the argument goes,\ncannot be expected to know that the immigration judge might be\nwrong. Because noncitizens will not recognize a substantive basis\nfor appeal to the BIA, that administrative review is not\npractically \u201cavailable\u201d under \u00a71326(d)(1).[3]Palomar-Santiago looks toRossv.Blakefor support. That case addressed the Prison Litigation\nReform Act, which requires that prisoners exhaust \u201csuch\nadministrative remedies as are available\u201d before suing in federal\ncourt. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a).Rossheld that\nwhether such remedies are \u201cavailable\u201d turns on \u201cthe real-world\nworkings of prison grievance systems,\u201d and it acknowledged that\nthere are \u201ccircumstances in which an administrative remedy,\nalthough officially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain\nrelief.\u201d 578 U.\u00a0S., at 643. Nothing inRoss, however,\nsuggests that the substantive complexity of an affirmative defense\ncan alone render further review of an adverse decision\n\u201cunavailable.\u201d Administrative review of removal orders exists\nprecisely so noncitizens can challenge the substance of immigration\njudges\u2019 decisions. The immigration judge\u2019s error on the merits does\nnot excuse the noncitizen\u2019s failure to comply with a mandatory\nexhaustion requirement if further administrative review, and then\njudicial review if necessary, could fix that very error.Second, Palomar-Santiago contends that the\n\u00a71326(d) prerequisites apply only when a defendant argues that his\nremoval order was procedurally flawed rather than substantively\ninvalid. There can be no \u201cchallenge\u201d to or \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on\nthe validity of substantively flawed orders, he reasons, because\nsuch orders are invalid from the moment they are entered.\nPalomar-Santiago\u2019s position ignores the plain meaning of both\n\u201cchallenge\u201d and \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d Arguing that a prior removal\norder was substantively unlawful is a \u201cchallenge\u201d to that order.\nSee Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 230 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cChallenge\u201d means\n\u201c[t]o object or except to\u201d or \u201cto put into dispute\u201d). When a\nchallenge to an order takes place in a separate \u201cproceeding that\nhas an independent purpose,\u201d such as a later criminal prosecution,\nit is a \u201ccollateral attack.\u201dId., at 261.Palomar-Santiago last invokes the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance.[4]\nCourts should indeed construe statutes \u201cto avoid not only the\nconclusion that [they are] unconstitutional, but also grave doubts\nupon that score.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jin Fuey Moy,241 U.S.\n394, 401 (1916). But this canon \u201chas no application in the\nabsence of statutory ambiguity.\u201dUnited Statesv.Oakland\nCannabis Buyers\u2019 Cooperative,532 U.S.\n483, 494 (2001). Here, the text of \u00a71326(d) unambiguously\nforecloses Palomar-Santiago\u2019s interpretation.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court holds that each of the statutory\nrequirements of \u00a71326(d) is mandatory. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1See,e.g.,United Statesv.Parrales-Guzman, 922 F.3d 706,\n706\u2013708 (CA5 2019);United Statesv.Watkins, 880\nF.3d 1221, 1224\u20131226 (CA11 2018) (per curiam);United\nStatesv.Gil-Lopez, 825 F.3d 819, 823 (CA7 2016);United Statesv.Soto-Mateo, 799 F.3d 117, 120\u2013124\n(CA1 2015);United Statesv.Rodriguez,420 F.3d 831, 833\u2013835 (CA8 2005);United Statesv.Rivera-Nevarez,418 F.3d 1104, 1107\u20131111 (CA10 2005);United Statesv.Martinez-Rocha,337 F.3d 566, 568\u2013570 (CA6 2003).2Palomar-Santiago\nseparately argues that the offense defined by \u00a71326(a) includes as\nan element the defendant\u2019s previous lawful removal such that\nunlawful removals cannot support a conviction.United Statesv.Mendoza-Lopez,481 U.S.\n828, 834\u2013835 (1987), rejected a similar argument with respect\nto the pre-AEDPA version of \u00a71326(a). Palomar-Santiago now presses\nvarious distinctions between that case and this, but the Court\ndeclines to address his arguments, which were neither raised below\nnor fairly encompassed by the question presented to this Court. SeeBrownbackv.King, 592 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a04\n(2021) (slip op., at 5, n.\u00a04).3On this theory, the\nunavailability of administrative review before the BIA would also\nmean that noncitizens like Palomar-Santiago do not have the\n\u201copportunity\u201d for judicial review under \u00a71326(d)(2), because they\nmay not seek review of a removal order in federal court without\nfirst appealing the order to the BIA. See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71252(d)(1).4Palomar-Santiago argues\nthat \u201ca scheme that permits the results of an administrative\nproceeding to conclusively establish a criminal offense\u201d raises\n\u201cdue process and separation of powers problems,\u201d which are\n\u201cheightened when .\u00a0.\u00a0. the agency never had the authority\nto issue the order in the first instance.\u201d Brief for Respondent 15.\nThe parties also strongly disagree about the sufficiency of the\npaths available for noncitizens to obtain review of prior removal\norders outside of an illegal-reentry prosecution. To the extent\nPalomar-Santiago raises freestanding constitutional claims on these\nbases, they were not raised below and are outside the scope of the\nnarrow question this Court granted certiorari to\ndecide.",
