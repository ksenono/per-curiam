    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTJAMES V. UNITED STATES550 U. S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-9264ALPHONSO JAMES, Jr., PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[April 18, 2007]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA), 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e), provides that a defendant\nconvicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in\nviolation of \u00a7922(g), is subject to a mandatory sentence of 15\nyears of imprisonment if the defendant has three prior convictions\n\u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201dThe question before us is whether attempted\nburglary, as defined by Florida law, is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under\nACCA. We hold that it is, and we therefore affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.IPetitioner Alphonso James pleaded\nguilty in federal court to one count of possessing a firearm after\nbeing convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7922(g)(1). In his\nguilty plea, James admitted to the three prior felony convictions\nlisted in his federal indictment. These included a conviction in\nFlorida state court for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in\nviolation of Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7810.02 and 777.04.[Footnote 1]At sentencing, the Government\nargued that James was subject to ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum\nterm because of his three prior convictions. James objected,\narguing that his attempted burglary conviction did not qualify as a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e). The District Court\nheld that attempted burglary is a violent felony, and the Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that holding, 430\nF.\u00a03d 1150, 1157 (2005). We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___\n(2006).IIAACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum\napplies \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of\nthis title [the felon in possession of a firearm provision] and has\nthree prior convictions \u2026 for a violent felony or a serious drug\noffense, or both, committed on occasions different from one\nanother.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as\u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year \u2026 that\u2014\u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of another;\nor\u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion,\ninvolves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(2)(B).Florida defined the crime of\nburglary at the time of James\u2019 conviction as follows:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018Burglary\u2019 means entering or remaining in a structure or a\nconveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the\npremises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is\nlicensed or invited to enter or remain.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.02(1)\n(1993). Florida\u2019s criminal attempt statute provided: \u201cA person who\nattempts to commit an offense prohibited by law and in such attempt\ndoes any act toward the commission of such offense, but fails in\nthe perpetration or is intercepted or prevented in the execution\nthereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt.\u201d \u00a7777.04(1). The\nattempted burglary conviction at issue here was punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.The parties agree that attempted burglary does\nnot qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (i) of ACCA\u2019s\ndefinition because it does not have \u201cas an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Nor does it\nqualify as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii).\nAttempted burglary is not robbery or extortion. It does not involve\nthe use of explosives. And it is not \u201cburglary\u201d because it does not\nmeet the definition of burglary under ACCA that this Court set\nforth inTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575, 598\n(1990): \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a\nbuilding or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d See\nFla. Stat. \u00a7777.04(1) (crime of attempt under Florida law requires\nas an element that the defendant \u201cfai[l] in the perpetration or\n[be] intercepted or prevented in the execution\u201d of the underlying\noffense).The question before the Court, then, is\nwhether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, falls within\nACCA\u2019s residual provision for crimes that \u201cotherwise involv[e]\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\nto another.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).BBefore determining whether the\nelements of attempted burglary under Florida law qualify under\nACCA\u2019s residual provision, we first consider James\u2019 argument that\nthe statute\u2019s text and structure categorically exclude attempt\noffenses from the scope of the residual provision. We conclude that\nnothing in the plain language of clause (ii), when read together\nwith the rest of the statute, prohibits attempt offenses from\nqualifying as ACCA predicates when they involve conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.James first argues that the\nresidual provision of clause (ii) must be read in conjunction with\nclause (i), which expressly includes in its definition of \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d offenses that have \u201cas an element the \u2026attempted\nuse\u2026 of physical force against another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\n(emphasis added). James thus concludes that Congress\u2019 express\ninclusion of attempt offenses in clause (i), combined with its\nfailure to mention attempts in clause (ii), demonstrates an intent\nto categorically exclude attempt offenses from the latter\nprovision.We are not persuaded. James\u2019\nreading would unduly narrow clause (ii)\u2019s residual provision, the\nlanguage of which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt\noffenses that otherwise meet the statutory criteria. Clause (i), in\ncontrast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus making it\nnecessary to specify exactly what types of offenses\u2014including\nattempt offenses\u2014are covered by its language. In short, \u201cthe\nexpansive phrasing of\u201d clause (ii) \u201cpoints directly away from the\nsort of exclusive specification\u201d that James would read into it.Chevron U. S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Echazabal,536 U. S. 73, 80 (2002);\nsee alsoUnited Statesv.Davis, 16 F.\u00a03d\n212, 217 (CA7) (rejecting argument that \u201chad Congress wished to\ninclude attempted burglary as a \u00a7924(e) predicate offense, it would\nhave done so expressly\u201d as \u201cuntenable in light of the very\nexistence of the \u2018otherwise\u2019 clause, which Congress plainly\nintended to serve as a catch-all provision\u201d), cert. denied,513 U. S. 945(1994).James next invokes the canon ofejusdem generis\u2014that when a general phrase follows a list\nof specifics, it should be read to include only things of the same\ntype as those specifically enumerated. He argues that the \u201ccommon\nattribute\u201d of the offenses specifically enumerated in clause\n(ii)\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives\u2014is that they are all completed offenses. The residual\nprovision, he contends, should similarly be read to extend only to\ncompleted offenses.This argument is unavailing. As an\ninitial matter, the premise on which it depends\u2014that clause (ii)\u2019s\nspecifically enumerated crimes are limited to completed offenses\u2014is\nfalse. An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government building,\nfor example, would qualify as a specifically enumerated predicate\noffense because it would \u201cinvolv[e] [the] use of explosives.\u201d See,e.g., \u00a7844(f)(1) (making it a crime to \u201cmaliciously\ndamag[e] or destro[y], orattemp[t]to damage or destroy,\nby means of fire or an explosive,\u201d certain property used in or\naffecting interstate commerce (emphasis added)).In any event, the most relevant\ncommon attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson,\nextortion, and explosives use is not \u201ccompletion.\u201d Rather, it is\nthat all of these offenses, while not technically crimes against\nthe person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury\nor confrontation that might result in bodily injury. As we noted inTaylor,\u201cCongress thought that certain general\ncategories of property crimes\u2014namely burglary, arson, extortion,\nand the use of explosives\u2014so often presented a risk of injury to\npersons, or were so often committed by career criminals, that they\nshould be included in the enhancement statute even though,\nconsidered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not\nnecessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.\u201d\n495 U. S., at 597.See alsoid., at 588 (noting\nthat Congress singled out burglary because it \u201coften creates the\npossibility of a violent confrontation\u201d);United Statesv.Adams, 51 Fed. Appx. 507, 508 (CA6 2002) (arson presents\n\u201ca serious risk of physical injury to another\u201d because \u201c[n]ot only\nmight the targeted building be occupied,\u201d but also \u201cthe fire could\nharm firefighters and onlookers and could spread to occupied\nstructures\u201d); H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 99\u2013849, p. 3 (1986) (purpose of\nclause (ii) was to \u201cadd State and Federal crimes against property\nsuch as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and similar\ncrimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a\nserious risk of injury to a person\u201d).Congress\u2019 inclusion of a broad\nresidual provision in clause (ii) indicates that it did not intend\nthe preceding enumerated offenses to be an exhaustive list of the\ntypes of crimes that might present a serious risk of injury to\nothers and therefore merit status as a \u00a7924(e) predicate offense.\nNothing in the statutory language supports the view that Congress\nintended to limit this category solely to completed\noffenses.CJames also relies on\nACCA\u2019s legislative history to buttress his argument that clause\n(ii) categorically excludes attempt offenses. In the deliberations\nleading up to ACCA\u2019s adoption in 1984, the House rejected a version\nof the statute that would have provided enhanced penalties for use\nof a firearm by persons with two prior convictions for \u201cany robbery\nor burglary offense,or a conspiracy or attempt to commit such\nan offense.\u201d S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a72 (1984) (emphasis\nadded). The bill that ultimately became law omitted any reference\nto attempts, and simply defined \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include\n\u201crobbery or burglary, or both.\u201d Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984,\n\u00a71802, 98 Stat. 2185, repealed in 1986 by Pub. L. 99\u2013308, \u00a7104(b),\n100 Stat. 459. James argues that Congress\u2019 rejection of this\nexplicit \u201cattempt\u201d language in 1984 evidenced an intent to exclude\nattempted burglary as a predicate offense.Whatever weight this\nlegislative history might ordinarily have, we do not find it\nprobative here, because the 1984 enactment on which James relies\nwas not Congress\u2019 last word on the subject. In 1986, Congress\namended ACCA for the purpose of \u201c\u00a0\u2018expanding\u2019 the range of\npredicate offenses.\u201dTaylor,supra, at 584. The\n1986 amendments added the more expansive language that is at issue\nin this case\u2014including clause (ii)\u2019s language defining as violent\nfelonies offenses that are \u201cburglary, arson, extortion, involv[e]\nuse of explosives, or otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Career\nCriminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402(b), 100 Stat. 3207\u201340,\ncodified at 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This language is\nsubstantially broader than the 1984 provision that it amended.\nBecause both the Government and the Court of Appeals relied on the\nbroader language of the 1986 amendments\u2014specifically, the residual\nprovision\u2014as the textual basis for including attempted burglary\nwithin the law\u2019s scope, Congress\u2019 rejection of express language\nincluding attempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not\ndispositive. Congress did not consider, much less reject, any such\nlanguage when it enacted the 1986 amendments. What it did consider,\nand ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded residual clause that\ndoes not by its terms exclude attempt offenses, and whose reach is\nbroad enough to encompass at least some such offenses.IIIHaving concluded that\nneither the statutory text nor the legislative history discloses\nany congressional intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses\nfrom the scope of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s residual provision, we next\nask whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is an\noffense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d In answering this question, we\nemploy the \u201c\u00a0\u2018categorical approach\u2019\u00a0\u201d that this Court has\ntaken with respect to other offenses under ACCA. Under this\napproach, we \u201c\u00a0\u2018look only to the fact of conviction and the\nstatutory definition of the prior offense,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and do not\ngenerally consider the \u201cparticular facts disclosed by the record of\nconviction.\u201dShepardv.United States,544 U. S. 13, 17 (2005)\n(quotingTaylor, 495 U. S., at 602). That is, we consider\nwhether theelements of the offenseare of the type that\nwould justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without\ninquiring into the specific conduct of this particular\noffender.AWe begin by examining\nwhat constitutes attempted burglary under Florida law. On its face,\nFlorida\u2019s attempt statute requires only that a defendant take \u201cany\nact toward the commission\u201d of burglary. Fla. Stat. \u00a7777.04(1).\nJames contends that this broad statutory language sweeps in merely\npreparatory activity that poses no real danger of harm to\nothers\u2014for example, acquiring burglars\u2019 tools or casing a structure\nwhile planning a burglary.But while the\nstatutory language is broad, the Florida Supreme Court has\nconsiderably narrowed its application in the context of attempted\nburglary, requiring an \u201covert act directed toward entering or\nremaining in a structure or conveyance.\u201dJonesv.State, 608 So.\u00a02d 797, 799 (1992). Mere preparation\nis not enough. Seeibid.[Footnote 2]Florida\u2019s lower courts appear to have\nconsistently applied this heightened standard. See,e.g.,Richardsonv.State, 922 So.\u00a02d 331, 334\n(App. 2006);Davisv.State, 741 So.\u00a02d\n1213, 1214 (App. 1999).The pivotal question, then, is\nwhether overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or\nremaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony\ntherein, is \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).BIn answering this\nquestion, we look to the statutory language for guidance. The\nspecific offenses enumerated in clause (ii) provide one baseline\nfrom which to measure whether other similar conduct \u201cotherwise \u2026\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d In this\ncase, we can ask whether the risk posed by attempted burglary is\ncomparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated\noffenses\u2014here, completed burglary. SeeTaylor,supra,at 600, n.\u00a09 (\u201cThe Government remains free to\nargue that any offense\u2014including offenses similar to generic\nburglary\u2014should count towards enhancement as one that \u2018otherwise\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another\u2019 under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u201d).The main risk of\nburglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully\nentering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility\nof a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third\nparty\u2014whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander\u2014who\ncomes to investigate. That is, the risk arises not from the\ncompletion of the burglary, but from the possibility that an\ninnocent person might appear while the crime is in\nprogress.Attempted burglary poses the same\nkind of risk. Interrupting an intruder at the doorstep while the\nwould-be burglar is attempting a break-in creates a risk of violent\nconfrontation comparable to that posed by finding him inside the\nstructure itself. As one court has explained:\u201cIn all of these cases the risk of\ninjury arises, not from the completion of the break-in, but rather\nfrom the possibility that some innocent party may appear on the\nscene while the break-in is occurring. This is just as likely to\nhappen before the defendant succeeds in breaking in as after.\nIndeed, the possibility may be at its peak while the defendant is\nstill outside trying to break in, as that is when he is likely to\nbe making noise and exposed to the public view\u2026\u00a0. [T]here is a\nserious risk of confrontation while a perpetrator is attempting to\nenter the building.\u201dUnited Statesv.Payne, 966\nF.\u00a02d 4, 8 (CA1 1992).Indeed, the risk\nposed by an attempted burglary that can serve as the basis for an\nACCA enhancement may be even greater than that posed by a typical\ncompleted burglary. All burglaries begin as attempted burglaries.\nBut ACCA only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries where\nthe offender has been apprehended, prosecuted, and convicted. This\nwill typically occur when the attempt is thwarted by some outside\nintervenor\u2014be it a property owner or law enforcement officer. Many\ncompleted burglaries do not involve such confrontations. But\nattempted burglaries often do; indeed, it is often just such\noutside intervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into\ncompletion.Concluding that attempted burglary\npresents a risk that is comparable to the risk posed by the\ncompleted offense, every Court of Appeals that has construed an\nattempted burglary law similar in scope to Florida\u2019s has held that\nthe offense qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (ii)\u2019s\nresidual provision.[Footnote 3]\nThe only cases holding to the contrary involved attempt laws that\ncould be satisfied by preparatory conduct that does not pose the\nsame risk of violent confrontation and physical harm posed by an\nattempt to enter a structure illegally.[Footnote 4] Given that Florida law, as interpreted by that\nState\u2019s highest court, requires an overt act directed toward the\nentry of a structure, we need not consider whether the more\nattenuated conduct encompassed by such laws presents a potential\nrisk of serious injury under ACCA.The United States Sentencing\nCommission has come to a similar conclusion with regard to the\nSentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement, whose\ndefinition of a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d closely tracks ACCA\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a74B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2006) (USSG). The\nCommission has determined that \u201ccrime[s] of violence\u201d for the\npurpose of the Guidelines enhancement \u201cinclude the offenses of\naiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such\noffenses.\u201d \u00a74B1.2, comment., n.\u00a01. This judgment was based on\nthe Commission\u2019s review of empirical sentencing data and presumably\nreflects an assessment that attempt crimes often pose a similar\nrisk of injury as completed offenses. As then-Judge Breyer\nexplained, \u201c[t]he Commission, which collects detailed sentencing\ndata on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than\nany individual court to make an informed judgment about the\nrelation between\u201d a particular offense and \u201cthe likelihood of\naccompanying violence.\u201dUnited Statesv.Doe, 960\nF.\u00a02d 221, 225 (CA1 1992); see also USSG \u00a71A3 (Nov. 1987),\nreprinted in \u00a71A1.1 comment. (Nov. 2006) (describing empirical\nbasis of Commission\u2019s formulation of Guidelines);United\nStatesv.Chambers, 473 F.\u00a03d 724 (CA7 2007)\n(noting the usefulness of empirical analysis from the Commission in\ndetermining whether an unenumerated crime poses a risk of\nviolence). While we are not bound by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s\nconclusion, we view it as further evidence that a crime like\nattempted burglary poses a risk of violence similar to that\npresented by the completed offense.CJames responds that\nit is not enough that attempted burglary \u201c\u00a0\u2018generally\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nor in \u201c\u00a0\u2018most cases\u2019\u00a0\u201d will create a risk of physical\ninjury to others. Brief for Petitioner 32. Citing the categorical\napproach we employed inTaylor, he argues that we cannot\ntreat attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense unlessallcases present such a risk. James\u2019 approach is\nsupported by neither the statute\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s holding inTaylor.One could, of course,\nimagine a situation in which attempted burglary might not pose a\nrealistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone\u2014for example, a\nbreak-in of an unoccupied structure located far off the beaten path\nand away from any potential intervenors. But ACCA does not require\nmetaphysical certainty. Rather, \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s residual\nprovision speaks in terms of a \u201cpotential risk.\u201d These are\ninherently probabilistic concepts.[Footnote 5] Indeed, the combination of the two terms\nsuggests that Congress intended to encompass possibilities even\nmore contingent or remote than a simple \u201crisk,\u201d much less a\ncertainty. While there may be some attempted burglaries that do not\npresent a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, the\nsame is true of completed burglaries\u2014which are explicitly covered\nby the statutory language and provide a baseline against which to\nmeasure the degree of risk that a non-enumerated offense must\n\u201cotherwise\u201d present in order to qualify.James\u2019 argument also misapprehendsTaylor\u2019s categorical approach. We do not view that\napproach as requiring that every conceivable factual offense\ncovered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential\nrisk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\nCf.Gonzalesv.Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. ___,\n___ (2007) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[T]o find that a state statute\ncreates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in\na federal statute requires more than the application of legal\nimagination to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic\nprobability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would\napply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic\ndefinition of a crime\u201d).Rather, the proper inquiry is\nwhether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in\nthe ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to\nanother. One can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a\nprototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of\ninjury\u2014for example, an attempted murder where the gun, unbeknownst\nto the shooter, had no bullets, seeUnited Statesv.Thomas, 361 F.\u00a03d 653, 659 (CADC 2004). Or, to take\nan example from the offenses specifically enumerated in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extortion scheme where an\nanonymous blackmailer threatens to release embarrassing personal\ninformation about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments.\nIn both cases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches\nzero. But that does not mean that the offenses of attempted murder\nor extortion are categorically nonviolent.As long as an offense is of a type\nthat, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to\nanother, it satisfies the requirements of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s\nresidual provision. Attempted burglary under Florida law\u2014as\nconstrued inJonesto require an overt act directed toward\nentry of a structure\u2014satisfies this test.DJustice Scalia\u2019s\ndissent criticizes our approach on the ground that it does not\nprovide sufficient guidance for lower courts required to decide\nwhether unenumerated offenses other than attempted burglary qualify\nas violent felonies under ACCA. But the dissent\u2019s alternative\napproach has more serious disadvantages. Among other things, that\napproach unnecessarily decides an important question that the\nparties have not briefed (the meaning of the term \u201cextortion\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)), decides that question in a way that is hardly\nfree from doubt, and fails to provide an interpretation of the\nresidual provision that furnishes clear guidance for future\ncases.The dissent\ninterprets the residual provision to require at least as much risk\nas the least dangerous enumerated offense. But the ordinary meaning\nof the language of the residual clause does not impose such a\nrequirement. What the clause demands is \u201ca serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.\u201d While it may be reasonable to infer\nthat the risks presented by the enumerated offenses involve a risk\nof this magnitude, it does not follow that an offense that presents\na lesser risk necessarily fails to qualify. Nothing in the language\nof \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules out the possibility that an offense may\npresent \u201ca serious risk of physical injury to another\u201d without\npresenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated\noffenses.Moreover, even if an unenumerated\noffense could not qualify without presenting at least as much risk\nas the least risky of the enumerated offenses, it would not be\nnecessary to identify the least risky of those offenses in order to\ndecide this case. Rather, it would be sufficient to establish\nsimply that the unenumerated offense presented at least as much\nrisk as one of the enumerated offenses. Thus, Justice Scalia\u2019s\ninterpretation of the meaning of the term \u201cextortion\u201d is\nunnecessary\u2014and inadvisable. The parties have not briefed this\nissue, and the proposed interpretation is hardly beyond question.\nInstead of interpreting the meaning of the term \u201cextortion\u201d in\naccordance with its meaning at common law or in modern federal and\nstate statutes, seeTaylor, 495 U. S., at 598, it is\nsuggested that we adopt an interpretation that seems to be entirely\nnovel and that greatly reduces the reach of ACCA.The stated reason for tackling\nthis question is to provide guidance for the lower courts in future\ncases\u2014surely a worthy objective. But in practical terms, the\nproposed interpretation of the residual clause would not make it\nmuch easier for the lower courts to decide whether other\nunenumerated offenses qualify. Without hard statistics\u2014and no such\nstatistics have been called to our attention\u2014how is a lower court\nto determine whether the risk posed by generic burglary is greater\nor less than the risk posed by an entirely unrelated unenumerated\noffense\u2014say, escape from prison?[Footnote 6]In the end,\nJustice Scalia\u2019s analysis of this case turns on the same question\nas ours\u2014i.e., the comparative risks presented by burglary\nand attempted burglary. The risk of physical injury in both cases\noccurs when there is a confrontation between the criminal and\nanother person, whether an occupant of the structure, a law\nenforcement officer or security guard, or someone else. It is\nargued that when such an encounter occurs during a consummated\nburglary (i.e., after entry), the risk is greater than it\nis when the encounter occurs during an attempted burglary\n(i.e., before entry is effected), and that may be true.\nBut this argument fails to come to grips with the fact that such\nencounters may occur much more frequently during attempted\nburglaries because it is precisely due to such encounters that many\nplanned burglaries do not progress beyond the attempt stage.\nJustice Scalia dismisses the danger involved when an encounter\noccur during attempted burglaries, stating that such encounters are\n\u201clikely to consist of nothing more than the occupant\u2019s yelling,\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 from his window, and the burglar\u2019s running away.\u201dPost,at 13. But there are many other possible scenarios.\nAn armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a\nprivate security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch\nprogram. Or a homeowner angered by the sort of conduct recited in\nJames\u2019 presentence report\u2014throwing a hammer through a window\u2014may\ngive chase, and a violent encounter may ensue. For these reasons\nand the reasons discussed above, we are convinced that the offense\nof attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, qualifies under\nACCA\u2019s residual clause.IVAlthough the question on which this Court\ngranted certiorari focused on the attempt prong of Florida\u2019s\nattempted burglary law, James also argues that the scope of the\nState\u2019s underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating\nattempted burglary as a violent felony for ACCA purposes.\nSpecifically, he argues that Florida\u2019s burglary statute differs\nfrom \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary as defined inTaylor,supra,at 598, because it defines a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[d]welling\u2019\u00a0\u201d to include not only the structure\nitself, but also the \u201ccurtilage thereof,\u201d[Footnote 7] Fla. Stat. \u00a7810.011(2)\n(1993).We\nagree that the inclusion of curtilage takes Florida\u2019s underlying\noffense of burglary outside the definition of \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d\nset forth inTaylor, which requires an unlawful entry\ninto, or remaining in, \u201cabuilding or other structure.\u201d\n495 U. S., at 598 (emphasis added). But that conclusion is not\ndispositive, because the Government does not argue that James\u2019\nconviction for attempted burglary constitutes \u201cburglary\u201d under\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Rather, it relies on the residual provision of\nthat clause, which\u2014as the Court has recognized\u2014can cover conduct\nthat is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar\nto, generic burglary.Id., at 600,\nn.\u00a09.Is the risk posed\nby an attempted entry of the curtilage comparable to that posed by\nthe attempted entry of a structure (which, as we concluded above,\nis sufficient to qualify under the residual provision)? We must\nagain turn to state law in order to answer this\nquestion.The Florida\nSupreme Court has construed curtilage narrowly, requiring \u201csome\nform of an enclosure in order for the area surrounding a residence\nto be considered part of the \u2018curtilage\u2019 as referred to in the\nburglary statute.\u201dStatev.Hamilton, 660\nSo.\u00a02d 1038, 1044 (1995) (holding that a yard surrounded by\ntrees was not \u201ccurtilage\u201d); see alsoUnited Statesv.Matthews, 466 F.\u00a03d 1271, 1274 (CA11 2006) (\u201cFlorida\ncase law construes curtilage narrowly, to include only an enclosed\narea surrounding a structure\u201d). Given this narrow definition, we do\nnot believe that the inclusion of curtilage so mitigates the risk\npresented by attempted burglary as to take the offense outside the\nscope of clause (ii)\u2019s residual provision.A typical reason\nfor enclosing the curtilage adjacent to a structure is to keep out\nunwanted visitors\u2014especially those with criminal motives. And a\nburglar who illegally attempts to enter the enclosed area\nsurrounding a dwelling creates much the same risk of physical\nconfrontation with a property owner, law enforcement official, or\nother third party as does one who attempts to enter the structure\nitself. In light of Florida\u2019s narrow definition of curtilage,\nattempted burglary of the curtilage requires both physical\nproximity to the structure and an overt act directed toward\nbreaching the enclosure. Such an attempt \u201cpresents a serious\npotential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be\ninjured.\u201dId.,at 1275 (holding that burglary of the\ncurtilage is a violent felony under ACCA\u2019s residual\nprovision).VFinally, James argues that construing\nattempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment\nissues underApprendiv.New Jersey,530 U. S. 466(2000),\nand its progeny because it is based on \u201cjudicial fact finding\u201d\nabout the risk presented by \u201cthe acts that underlie \u2018most\u2019\nconvictions for attempted burglary.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 34, 35.\nThis argument is without merit.In\ndetermining whether attempted burglary under Florida law qualifies\nas a violent felony under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the Court is engaging\nin statutory interpretation, not judicial factfinding. Indeed, by\napplyingTaylor\u2019s categorical approach, we have avoided\nany inquiry into the underlying facts of James\u2019 particular offense,\nand have looked solely to the elements of attempted burglary as\ndefined by Florida law. Such analysis raises no Sixth Amendment\nissue.[Footnote\n8]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For\nthese reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit is affirmed.It is so\nordered.Footnote 1James\u2019 two other\nprior convictions\u2014for possession of cocaine and trafficking in\ncocaine\u2014were determined to be \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under ACCA,\nsee 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(1), and are not at issue\nhere.Footnote 2TheJonescourt distinguished its earlier holding inThomasv.State, 531 So.\u00a02d 708 (1988).\nThere, the State Supreme Court upheld a conviction under a state\nstatute criminalizing the possession of burglary tools, Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7810.06, where the defendant had been arrested after jumping a\nfence and trying to run away from police while carrying a\nscrewdriver.Jonesheld that \u201cthe overt act necessary to\nconvict of the burglary tool crime is not the same as the overt act\nrequired to prove attempted burglary,\u201d and noted that the conduct\ncharged inThomaswould not be sufficient to prove\nattempted burglary because the defendant in that case committed no\novert act directed toward entering or remaining in a building. 608\nSo.\u00a02d, at 799.Footnote 3SeeUnited\nStatesv.Lane, 909 F.\u00a02d 895, 903 (CA6 1990)\n(construing Ohio attempted burglary law: \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0The fact\nthat an offender enters a building to commit a crime often creates\nthe possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and\nan occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to\ninvestigate.\u2019\u2026 The fact that [the defendant] did not complete the\nburglary offense does not diminish the serious potential risk of\ninjury to another arising from an attempted burglary\u201d);United\nStatesv.Fish, 928 F.\u00a02d 185, 188 (CA6 1991)\n(Michigan attempted burglary law);United Statesv.Payne, 966 F.\u00a02d 4, 8 (CA1 1992) (Massachusetts\nattempted-breaking-and-entering law);United Statesv.O\u2019Brien, 972 F.\u00a02d 47, 52 (CA3 1992) (Massachusetts\nattempted-breaking-and-entering law: \u201c[T]he possibility of a\nviolent confrontation with an innocent party is always present when\na perpetrator attempts to enter a building illegally, even when the\ncrime is not actually completed\u201d);United Statesv.Solomon, 998 F.\u00a02d 587, 590 (CA8 1993) (Minnesota\nattempted burglary law);United Statesv.Custis, 988 F.\u00a02d 1355, 1364 (CA4 1993) (Maryland\nattempted-breaking-and-entering law: \u201cIn most cases, attempted\nbreaking and entering will be charged when a defendant has been\ninterrupted in the course of illegally entering a home.\nInterrupting an intruder while breaking into a home involves a risk\nof confrontation nearly as great as finding him inside the house\u201d);United Statesv.Thomas, 2 F.\u00a03d 79, 80 (CA4\n1993) (New Jersey attempted burglary law);United Statesv.Andrello, 9 F.\u00a03d 247, 249\u2013250 (CA2 1993) (New\nYork attempted burglary law);United Statesv.Davis, 16 F.\u00a03d 212, 218 (CA7 1994) (Illinois\nattempted burglary law);United Statesv.Bureau,\n52 F.\u00a03d 584, 593 (CA6 1995) (Tennessee attempted burglary\nlaw: \u201c[T]he propensity for a violent confrontation and the serious\npotential risk of injury inherent in burglary is not diminished\nwhere the burglar is not successful in completing the crime.

Seepost,at 17. The statutory requirement that an\nunenumerated crime \u201cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is not so\nindefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what\nconduct it prohibits. SeeKolenderv.Lawson,461 U. S. 352,\n357 (1983). Similar formulations have been used in other federal\nand state criminal statutes. See,e.g., 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72332b(a)(1)(B) (defining \u201cterrorist act\u201d as conduct that, among\nother things, \u201ccreates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury\nto any other person\u201d); Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Stat. \u00a7810.02(1). But because James (in\naccordance with what appears to be the general practice in Florida)\nwas specifically charged with and convicted of \u201cattempted burglaryof a dwelling,\u201d we need not examine this point\nfurther.Footnote 8To the extent\nthat James contends that the simple fact of his prior conviction\nwas required to be found by a jury, his position is baseless. James\nadmitted the fact of his prior conviction in his guilty plea, and\nin any case, we have held that prior convictions need not be\ntreated as an element of the offense for Sixth Amendment purposes.Almendarez-Torresv.United States,523 U.
