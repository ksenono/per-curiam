    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 15\u20136092_________________RICHARD MATHIS, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[June 23, 2016]Justice Thomas, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion, which faithfully\napplies our precedents. The Court holds that the modified\ncategorical approach cannot be used to determine the specific means\nby which a defendant committed a crime.Ante,at 11\u201312. By\nrightly refusing to apply the modified categorical approach, the\nCourt avoids further extending its precedents that limit a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s right to a public trial before a jury of his peers.InAlmendarez-Torresv.United\nStates, 523 U.\u00a0S. 224 \u2013247 (1998), the Court held that the\nexistence of a prior conviction triggering enhanced penalties for a\nrecidivist was a fact that could be found by a judge, not an\nelement of the crime that must be found by a jury. Two years later,\nthe Court held that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a\ncrime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d is an element of a\ncrime and therefore \u201cmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\na reasonable doubt.\u201dApprendiv.New Jersey, 530\nU.\u00a0S. 466, 490 (2000) ; seeid.,at 489\u2013490. ButApprendirecognized an exception for the \u201cfact of a prior\nconviction,\u201d instead of overrulingAlmendarez-Torres.See\n530 U.\u00a0S., at 490. I continue to believe that the exception inApprendiwas wrong, and I have urged thatAlmendarez-Torresbe reconsidered. SeeDescampsv.United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).Consistent with this view, I continue to believe\nthat depending on judge-found facts in Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA) cases violates the Sixth Amendment and is irreconcilable\nwithApprendi. ACCA improperly \u201callows the judge to \u2018mak[e]\na finding that raises [a defendant\u2019s] sentence beyond the sentence\nthat could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found\nby the jury or admitted by the defendant.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDescamps,\nsupra,at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 1\u20132)\n(brackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted). This\nSixth Amendment problem persists regardless of whether \u201ca court is\ndetermining whether a prior conviction was entered, or attempting\nto discern what facts were necessary to a prior conviction.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 2) (citation omitted).Today, the Court \u201cat least limits the situations\nin which courts make factual determinations about prior\nconvictions.\u201dIbid.As the Court explains, the means of\ncommitting an offense are nothing more than \u201cvarious factual ways\nof committing some component of the offense.\u201dAnte,at 4.\nPermitting judges to determine the means of committing a prior\noffense would expandAlmendarez-Torres. Therefore, I join\nthe Court\u2019s opinion refusing to allow judges to determine, without\na jury, which alternative means supported a defendant\u2019s prior\nconvictions.",
