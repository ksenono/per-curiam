    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 14\u2013770_________________BANK MARKAZI, aka THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRAN,\nPETITIONERv.DEBORAH PETERSON, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[April 20, 2016]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice\nSotomayor joins, dissenting.Imagine your neighbor sues you, claiming that\nyour fence is on his property. His evidence is a letter from the\nprevious owner of your home, accepting your neighbor\u2019s version of\nthe facts. Your defense is an official county map, which under\nstate law establishes the boundaries of your land. The map shows\nthe fence on your side of the property line. You also argue that\nyour neighbor\u2019s claim is six months outside the statute of\nlimitations.Now imagine that while the lawsuit is pending,\nyour neighbor persuades the legislature to enact a new statute. The\nnew statute provides that for your case, and your case alone, a\nletter from one neighbor to another is conclusive of property\nboundaries, and the statute of limitations is one year longer. Your\nneighbor wins. Who would you say decided your case: the\nlegislature, which targeted your specific case and eliminated your\nspecific defenses so as to ensure your neighbor\u2019s victory, or the\ncourt, which pre-sided over thefait accompli?That question lies at the root of the case the\nCourt confronts today. Article III of the Constitution commits the\npower to decide cases to the Judiciary alone. SeeSternv.Marshall, 564 U.\u00a0S. 462, 484 (2011) . Yet, in this\ncase, Congress arrogated that power to itself. Since 2008,\nrespondents have sought $1.75 billion in assets owned by Bank\nMarkazi, Iran\u2019s central bank, in order to satisfy judgments against\nIran for acts of terrorism. The Bank has vigorously opposed those\nefforts, asserting numerous legal defenses. So, in 2012, four years\ninto the litigation, respondents persuaded Congress to enact a\nstatute, 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78772, that for this case alone\neliminates each of the defenses standing in respondents\u2019 way. Then,\nhaving gotten Congress to resolve all outstanding issues in their\nfavor, respondents returned to court .\u00a0.\u00a0. and won.Contrary to the majority, I would hold that\n\u00a78772 violates the separation of powers. No less than if it had\npassed a law saying \u201crespondents win,\u201d Congress has decided this\ncase by enacting a bespoke statute tailored to this case that\nresolves the parties\u2019 specific legal disputes to guarantee\nrespondents victory.IAArticle III, \u00a71 of the Constitution vests the\n\u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d in the Federal Judiciary.\nThat provision, this Court has observed, \u201csafeguards the role of\nthe Judicial Branch in our tripartite system.\u201dCommodity Futures\nTrading Comm\u2019nv.Schor, 478 U.\u00a0S. 833, 850 (1986)\n. It establishes the Judiciary\u2019s independence by giving the\nJudiciary distinct and inviolable authority. \u201cUnder the basic\nconcept of separation of powers,\u201d the judicial power \u201ccan no more\nbe shared with another branch than the Chief Executive, for\nexample, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the\nCongress share with the Judiciary the power to override a\nPresidential veto.\u201dStern, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 483 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The separation of powers, in turn,\nsafeguards individual freedom. SeeBondv.United\nStates, 564 U.\u00a0S. 211, 223 (2011) . As Hamilton wrote,\nquoting Montesquieu, \u201c\u00a0\u2018there is no liberty if the power of\njudging be not separated from the legislative and executive\npowers.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed.\n1961); see Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws 157 (A. Cohler, B.\nMiller, & H. Stone eds. 1989) (Montesquieu).The question we confront today is whether \u00a78772\nviolates Article III by invading the judicial power.B\u201cThe Framers of our Constitution lived among\nthe ruins of a system of intermingled legislative and judicial\npowers.\u201dPlautv.Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514\nU.\u00a0S. 211, 219 (1995) . We surveyed those ruins inPlautto determine the scope of the judicial power under\nArticle III, and we ought to return to them today for that same\npurpose.Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, colonial\nlegislatures performed what are now recognized as core judicial\nroles. They \u201cfunctioned as courts of equity of last resort, hearing\noriginal actions or providing appellate review of judicial\njudgments.\u201dIbid.They \u201cconstantly heard private petitions,\nwhich often were only the complaints of one individual or group\nagainst another, and made final judgments on these complaints.\u201d G.\nWood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776\u20131787, pp. 154\u2013155\n(1969). And they routinely intervened in cases still pending before\ncourts, granting continuances, stays of judgments, \u201cnew trials, and\nother kinds of relief in an effort to do what \u2018is agreeable to\nRight and Justice.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 155; see Judicial Action\nby the Provincial Legislature of Massachusetts, 15 Harv. L. Rev.\n208, 216\u2013218 (1902) (collecting examples of such laws).The judicial power exercised by colonial\nlegislatures was often expressly vested in them by the colonial\ncharter or statute. In the Colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut,\nand Rhode Island, for example, the assemblies officially served as\nthe highest court of appeals. See 1 The Public Records of the\nColony of Connecticut 25 (Trumbull ed. 1850); M. Clarke,\nParliamentary Privilege in the American Colonies 31\u201333 (1943).\nLikewise, for more than a half century, the colonial assembly of\nVirginia could review and set aside court judgments.Id.,at\n37\u201338. And in New Hampshire, where British authorities directed\njudicial appeals to the governor and his council, those officials\noften referred such matters to the assembly for decision.Id.,at 33. Colonial assemblies thus sat atop the judicial\npyramid, with the final word over when and how private disputes\nwould be resolved.Legislative involvement in judicial matters\nintensified during the American Revolution, fueled by the\n\u201cvigorous, indeed often radical, populism of the revolutionary\nlegislatures and assemblies.\u201dPlaut, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 219;\nsee Wood,supra,at 155\u2013156. The Pennsylvania Constitution\nof 1776 epitomized the ethos of legislative supremacy. It\nestablished a unicameral assembly unconstrained by judicial review\nand vested with authority to \u201c\u00a0\u2018redress grievances.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nReport of the Committee of the Pennsylvania Council of Censors 42\n(F. Bailey ed. 1784) (Council Report); see Williams, The State\nConstitutions of the Founding Decade: Pennsylvania\u2019s Radical 1776\nConstitution and Its Influences on American Constitutionalism, 62\nTemp. L.\u00a0Rev. 541, 547\u2013548, 556 (1989). The assembly, in turn,\ninvoked that authority to depart from legal rules in resolving\nprivate disputes in order to ease the \u201chardships which will always\narise from the operation of general laws.\u201d Council Report\n42\u201343.The Revolution-era \u201ccrescendo of legislative\ninterference with private judgments of the courts,\u201d however, soon\nprompted a \u201csense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative\nfrom the judicial power.\u201dPlaut, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 221. In\n1778, an influential critique of a proposed (and ultimately\nrejected) Massachusetts constitution warned that \u201c[i]f the\nlegislative and judicial powers are united, the maker of the law\nwill also interpret it; and the law may then speak a language,\ndictated by the whims, the caprice, or the prejudice of the judge.\u201d\nThe Essex Result, in The Popular Sources of Political Authority:\nDocuments on the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, p. 337 (O.\nHandlin & M. Handlin eds. 1966). In Virginia, Thomas Jefferson\ncomplained that the assembly had, \u201cin many instances, decided\nrights which should have been left to judiciary controversy.\u201d\nJefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia 120 (Peden ed. 1982). And\nin Pennsylvania, the Council of Censors\u2014a body appointed to assess\ncompliance with the state constitution\u2014decried the state assembly\u2019s\npractice of \u201cextending their deliberations to the cases of\nindividuals\u201d instead of deferring to \u201cthe usual process of law,\u201d\nciting instances when the assembly overturned fines, settled\nestates, and suspended prosecutions. Council Report 38, 42.\n\u201c[T]here is reason to think,\u201d the Censors observed, \u201cthat favour\nand partiality have, from the nature of public bodies of men,\npredominated in the distribution of this relief.\u201dId.,at\n38.Vermont\u2019s Council of Censors sounded similar\nwarnings. Its 1786 report denounced the legislature\u2019s \u201cassumption\nof the judicial power,\u201d which the legislature had exercised by\nstaying and vacating judgments, suspending lawsuits, resolving\nproperty disputes, and \u201clegislating for individ-uals, and for\nparticular cases.\u201d Vermont State Papers 1779\u20131786, pp. 537\u2013542 (W.\nSlade ed. 1823). The Censors concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative body\nis, in truth, by no means competent to the determination of causes\nbetween party and party,\u201d having exercised judicial power \u201cwithout\nbeing shackled with rules,\u201d guided only by \u201ccrude notions of\nequity.\u201dId.,at 537, 540.The States\u2019 experiences ultimately shaped the\nFederal Constitution, figuring prominently in the Framers\u2019 decision\nto devise a system for securing liberty through the division of\npower:\u201cBefore and during the debates on\nratification, Madison, Jefferson, and Hamilton each wrote of the\nfactional disorders and disarray that the system of legislative\nequity had produced in the years before the framing; and each\nthought that the separation of the legislative from the judicial\npower in the new Constitution would cure them.\u201dPlaut, 514\nU.\u00a0S., at 221.As Professor Manning has concluded, \u201cArticle\nIII, in large measure, reflects a reaction against the practice\u201d of\nlegislative interference with state courts. Manning, Response,\nDeriving Rules of Statutory Interpretation from the Constitution,\n101 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1648, 1663 (2001).Experience had confirmed Montesquieu\u2019s theory.\nThe Framers saw that if the \u201cpower of judging .\u00a0.\u00a0. were\njoined to legislative power, the power over the life and liberty of\nthe citizens would be arbitrary.\u201d Montesquieu 157. They accordingly\nresolved to take the unprecedented step of establishing a \u201ctruly\ndistinct\u201d judiciary. The Federalist No. 78, at 466 (A. Hamilton).\nTo help ensure the \u201ccomplete independence of the courts of\njustice,\u201dibid., they provided life tenure for judges and\nprotection against diminution of their compensation. But such\nsafeguards against indirect interference would have been\nmeaningless if Congress could simply exercise the judicial power\ndi-rectly. The central pillar of judicial independence was Article\nIII itself, which vested \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United\nStates\u201d in \u201cone supreme Court\u201d and such \u201cinferior Courts\u201d as might\nbe established. The judicial power was to be the Judiciary\u2019s\nalone.IIAMindful of this history, our decisions have\nrecognized three kinds of \u201cunconstitutional restriction[s] upon the\nexercise of judicial power.\u201dPlaut, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 218.\nTwo concern the effect of judgments once they have been rendered:\n\u201cCongress cannot vest review of the decisions of Article III courts\nin officials of the Executive Branch,\u201dibid., for to do so\nwould make a court\u2019s judgment merely \u201can advisory opinion in its\nmost obnoxious form,\u201dChicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc.v.Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U.\u00a0S. 103, 113 (1948) .\nAnd Congress cannot \u201cretroactively command[\u00a0] the federal\ncourts to reopen final judgments,\u201d because Article III \u201cgives the\nFederal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but todecidethem, subject to review only by superior courts in\nthe Article III hierarchy.\u201dPlaut, 514 U.\u00a0S., at\n218\u2013219. Neither of these rules is directly implicated here.This case is about the third type of\nunconstitutional interference with the judicial function, whereby\nCongress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular pending\ncase in the first instance. Section 8772 does precisely that,\nchanging the law\u2014for these proceedings alone\u2014simply to guarantee\nthat respondents win. The law serves no other purpose\u2014a point,\nindeed, that is hardly in dispute. As the majority acknowledges,\nthe statute \u201c\u00a0\u2018sweeps away .\u00a0.\u00a0. any .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfederal or state law impediments that might otherwise exist\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nto bar respondents from obtaining Bank Markazi\u2019s assets.Ante,at 9\u201310 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a). In the\nDistrict Court, Bank Markazi had invoked sovereign immunity under\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71611(b)(1). Brief for Petitioner 28. Section 8772(a)(1) eliminates\nthat immunity. Bank Markazi had argued that its status as a\nseparate juridical entity under federal common law and\ninternational law freed it from liability for Iran\u2019s debts. SeeFirst Nat. City Bankv.Banco Para el Comercio Exterior\nde Cuba, 462 U.\u00a0S. 611 \u2013627 (1983); Brief for Petitioner\n27\u201328. Section 8772(d)(3) ensures that the Bank is liable. Bank\nMarkazi had argued that New York law did not allow respondents to\nexecute their judgments against the Bank\u2019s assets. See N.\u00a0Y.\nU. C. C. Law Ann. \u00a78\u2013112(c) (West 2002); see also App. to Pet. for\nCert. 126a (agreeing with this argument). Section 8772(a)(1) makes\nthose assets subject to execution. Seeid.,at 97a.Section 8772 authorized attachment, moreover,\nonly for the\u201cfinancial assets that are identified in\nand the subject of proceedings in the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York in Peterson et\u00a0al. v.\nIslamic Republic of Iran et\u00a0al., Case No. 10 Civ. 4518 (BSJ)\n(GWG), that were restrained by restraining notices and levies\nsecured by the plaintiffs in those proceedings\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \u00a78772(b).And lest there be any doubt that Congress\u2019s sole\nconcern was deciding this particular case, rather than establishing\nany generally applicable rules, \u00a78772 provided that nothing in the\nstatute \u201cshall be construed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to affect the\navailability, or lack thereof, of a right to satisfy a judgment in\nany other action against a terrorist party in any proceedings other\nthan\u201d these. \u00a78772(c).[1]BThere has never been anything like \u00a78772\nbefore. Neither the majority nor respondents have identified\nanother statute that changed the law for a pending case in an\noutcome-determinative way and explicitly limited its effect to\nparticular judicial proceedings. That fact alone is \u201c[p]erhaps the\nmost telling indication of the severe constitutional problem\u201d with\nthe law.Free Enterprise Fundv.Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 477, 505 (2010)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Congress\u2019s \u201cprolonged reticence\nwould be amazing if such interference were not understood to be\nconstitutionally proscribed.\u201dPlaut, 514 U.\u00a0S., at\n230.Section 8772 violates the bedrock rule of\nArticle III that the judicial power is vested in the Judicial\nBranch alone. We first enforced that rule against an Act of\nCongress during the Reconstruction era inUnited Statesv.Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872).Kleinarose from\ncongressional opposition to conciliation with the South, and in\nparticular to the pardons Presidents Lincoln and Johnson had\noffered to former Confederate rebels. Seeid.,at 140\u2013141;\nsee,e.g.,Presidential Proclamation No. 11, 13Stat. 737.\nAlthough this Court had held that a pardon was proof of loyalty and\nentitled its holder to compensation in the Court of Claims for\nproperty seized by Union forces during the war, seeUnited\nStatesv.Padelford, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870), the\nRadical Republican Congress wished to prevent pardoned rebels from\nobtaining such compensation. It therefore enacted a law prohibiting\nclaimants from using a pardon as evidence of loyalty, instead\nrequiring the Court of Claims and Supreme Court to dismiss for want\nof jurisdiction any suit based on a pardon. See Act of July 12,\n1870, ch. 251, 16Stat. 235; see alsoUnited Statesv.Sioux Nation, 448 U.\u00a0S. 371, 403 (1980) .Klein\u2019s suit was among those Congress wished to\nblock. Klein represented the estate of one V. F. Wilson, a\nConfederate supporter whom Lincoln had pardoned. On behalf of the\nestate, Klein had obtained a sizable judg-ment in the Court of\nClaims for property seized by the Union.Klein, 13 Wall., at\n132\u2013134. The Government\u2019s appeal from that judgment was pending in\nthe Supreme Court when the law targeting such suits took effect.\nThe Government accordingly moved to dismiss the entire\nproceeding.This Court, however, denied that motion and\ninstead declared the law unconstitutional. It held that the law\n\u201cpassed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial\npower.\u201dId., at 147. The Court acknowledged that Congress\nmay \u201cmake exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate\npower,\u201d but it refused to sustain the law as an exercise of that\nauthority.Id.,at 146. Instead, the Court held that the law\nviolated the separation of powers by attempting to \u201cdecide\u201d the\ncase by \u201cprescrib[ing] rules of decision to the Judicial Department\nof the government in cases pending before it.\u201dId.,at\n145\u2013146. \u201cIt is of vital importance,\u201d the Court stressed, that the\nlegislative and judicial powers \u201cbe kept distinct.\u201dId.,at\n147.The majority characterizesKleinas a\ndelphic, puzzling decision whose central holding\u2014that Congress may\nnot prescribe the result in pending cases\u2014cannot be taken at face\nvalue.[2] It is true thatKleincan be read too broadly, in a way that would swallow\nthe rule that courts generally must apply a retroactively\napplicable statute to pending cases. SeeUnited Statesv.Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 110 (1801). ButSchooner\nPeggycan be read too broadly, too. Applying a retroactive law\nthat says \u201cSmith wins\u201d to the pending case ofSmithv.Jonesimplicates profound issues of separation of powers,\nissues not adequately answered by a citation toSchooner\nPeggy. And just becauseKleindid not set forth clear\nrules defining the limits on Congress\u2019s authority to legislate with\nrespect to a pending case does not mean\u2014as the majority seems to\nthink\u2014that Article III itself imposes no such limits.The same \u201crecord of history\u201d that drove the\nFramers to adopt Article III to implement the separation of powers\nought to compel us to give meaning to their design.Plaut,\n514 U.\u00a0S., at 218. The nearly two centuries of experience with\nlegislative assumption of judicial power meant that \u201c[t]he Framers\nwere well acquainted with the danger of subjecting the\ndetermination of the rights of one person to the tyranny of\nshifting majorities.\u201dINSv.Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S.\n919, 961 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Article III vested the judicial power in\nthe Judiciary alone to protect against that threat to liberty. It\ndefined not only what the Judiciary can do, but also what Congress\ncannot.The Court says it would reject a law that says\n\u201cSmith wins\u201d because such a statute \u201cwould create no new\nsubstantive law.\u201dAnte, at 12, n.\u00a017. Of course it\nwould: Prior to the passage of the hypothetical statute, the law\ndid not provide that Smith wins. After the passage of the law, it\ndoes. Changing the law is simply how Congress acts. The question is\nwhether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power.\nSaying Congress \u201ccreates new law\u201d in one case but not another\nsimply expresses a conclusion on that issue; it does not supply a\nreason.\u201cSmith wins\u201d is a new law, tailored to one case\nin the same way as \u00a78772 and having the same effect. All that both\nstatutes \u201ceffectuat[e],\u201d in substance, is lawmakers\u2019 \u201cpolicy\njudgment\u201d that one side in one case ought to prevail.Ante,at 18. The cause for concern is that though the statutes are\nindistinguishable, it is plain that the majority recognizes no\nlimit under the separation of powers beyond the prohibition on\nstatutes as brazen as \u201cSmith wins.\u201d Hamilton warned that the\nJudiciary must take \u201call possible care .\u00a0.\u00a0. to defend\nitself against [the] attacks\u201d of the other branches. The Federalist\nNo. 78, at 466. In the Court\u2019s view, however, Article III is but a\nconstitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest\nmaneuver of taking away every defense against Smith\u2019s victory,\nwithout saying \u201cSmith wins.\u201dTake the majority\u2019s acceptance of the District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that \u00a78772 left \u201cplenty\u201d of factual\ndeterminations for the court \u201cto adjudicate.\u201dAnte, at\n16\u201317, and n.\u00a020 (internal quotation marks omitted). All \u00a78772\nactually required of the court was two factual determinations\u2014that\nBank Markazi has an equitable or beneficial interest in the assets,\nand that no other party does, \u00a78772(a)(2)\u2014both of which were well\nestablished by the time Congress enacted \u00a78772. Not only had the\nassets at issue been frozen pursuant to an Executive Order blocking\n\u201cproperty of the Government of Iran,\u201d Exec. Order No. 13599, 77\nFed. Reg. 6659 (2012), but the Bank had \u201crepeatedly insisted that\nit is the sole beneficial owner of the Blocked Assets,\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 113a. By that measure of \u201cplenty,\u201d the majority\nwould have to uphold a law directing judgment for Smith if the\ncourt finds that Jones was duly served with notice of the\nproceedings, and that Smith\u2019s claim was within the statute of\nlimitations. In reality, the Court\u2019s \u201cplenty\u201d is plenty of nothing,\nand, apparently, nothing is plenty for the Court. See D. Heyward\n& I. Gershwin, Porgy and Bess: Libretto 28 (1958).It is true that some of the precedents cited by\nthe majority,ante,at 17\u201319, have allowed Congress to\napproach the boundary between legislative and judicial power. None,\nhowever, involved statutes comparable to \u00a78772. InRobertsonv.Seattle Audubon Soc., 503 U.\u00a0S. 429 (1992) , for\nexample, the statute at issue referenced particular cases only as a\nshorthand for describing certain environmental law requirements,id.,at 433\u2013435, not to limit the statute\u2019s effect to those\ncases alone. And inPlaut, the Court explicitly\ndistinguished the statute before it\u2014which directed courts to reopen\nfinal judgments in an entire class of cases\u2014from one that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018single[s] out\u2019 any defendant for adverse treatment (or any\nplaintiff for favorable treatment).\u201d 514 U.\u00a0S., at 238.Plaut, in any event, held the statute before itinvalid, concluding that it violated Article III based on\nthe same historical understanding of the judicial power outlined\nabove.Id.,at 219\u2013225, 240.[3]I readily concede, without embarrassment, that\nit can sometimes be difficult to draw the line between legislative\nand judicial power. That should come as no surprise; Chief Justice\nMarshall\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018it is aconstitutionwe are\nexpounding\u2019 is especially relevant when the Court is required to\ngive legal sanctions to an underlying principle of the\nConstitution\u2014that of separation of powers.\u201dYoungstown Sheet\n& Tube Co.v.Sawyer, 343 U.\u00a0S. 579 \u2013597 (1952)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (quotingMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819)). But however difficult\nit may be to discern the line between the Legislative and Judicial\nBranches, the entire constitu-tional enterprise depends on therebeingsuch a line. The Court\u2019s failure to enforce that\nboundary in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere\n\u201cparchment barrier[\u00a0] against the encroaching spirit\u201d of\nlegislative power. The Federalist No. 48, at 308 (J. Madison).CFinally, the majority suggests that \u00a78772 is\nanalogous to the Executive\u2019s historical power to recognize foreign\nstate sovereign immunity on a case-by-case basis. As discussed\nabove, however, \u00a78772 does considerably more than withdraw the\nBank\u2019s sovereign immunity.Supra,at 7\u20138. It strips the Bank\nof any protection that federal common law, international law, or\nNew York State law might have offered against respondents\u2019 claims.\nThat is without analogue or precedent. In any event, the practice\nof applying case-specific Executive submissions on sovereign\nimmunity was not judicial acquiescence in an intrusion on the\nJudiciary\u2019s role. It was instead the result of substantive\nsovereign immunity law, developed and applied by the courts, which\ntreated such a submission as a dispositive fact. SeeVerlinden\nB. V.v.Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480\n\u2013487 (1983);Ex parte Peru, 318 U.\u00a0S. 578 \u2013588\n(1943).The majority also compares \u00a78772 to the\npolitical branches\u2019 authority to \u201cexercise[\u00a0] control over\nclaims against foreign states and the disposition of foreign-state\nproperty in the United States.\u201dAnte,at 21 (citingDames\n& Moorev.Regan, 453 U.\u00a0S. 654 (1981) ). InDames & Moore, we considered whether the President had\nauthority to suspend claims against Iran, and to nullify existing\ncourt orders attaching Iran\u2019s property, in order to fulfill\nU.\u00a0S. obligations under a claims settlement agreement with\nthat country.Id., at 664\u2013667. We held that the President\nhad that power, based on a combination of statutory authorization,\ncongressional acquiescence, and inherent Executive power. Seeid.,at 674\u2013675, 686.The majority suggests thatDames &\nMooresupports the validity of \u00a78772. ButDames &\nMoorewas self-consciously \u201ca restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor this day and train only.\u201dSmithv.Allwright, 321\nU.\u00a0S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). The Court\nstressed inDames & Moorethat it \u201cattempt[ed] to lay\ndown no general \u2018guidelines\u2019 covering other situations not involved\nhere, and attempt[ed] to confine the opinion only to the very\nquestions necessary to [the] decision of the case.\u201d 453 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 661; see alsoAmerican Ins. Assn.v.Garamendi,\n539 U.\u00a0S. 396, 438 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cNotably, the Court inDames & Moorewas emphatic about\nthe \u2018narrowness\u2019 of its decision.\u201d).There are, moreover, several important\ndifferences betweenDames & Mooreand this case. For\nstarters, the executive actionDames & Mooreupheld did\nnot dictate how particular claims were to be resolved, but simply\nrequired such claims to be submitted to a different tribunal. 453\nU.\u00a0S., at 660. Furthermore,Dames & Mooresanctioned that action based on the political branches\u2019\n\u201clongstanding\u201d practice of \u201csettl[ing] the claims of [U.\u00a0S.]\nnationals against foreign countries\u201d by treaty or executive\nagreement.Id., at 679. The Court emphasized that throughout\nour history, the political branches have at times \u201cdisposed of the\nclaims of [U.\u00a0S.] citizens without their consent, or even\nwithout consultation with them,\u201d by renouncing claims, settling\nthem, or establishing arbitration proceedings.Id., at\n679\u2013681 (internal quotation marks omitted). Those dispositions,\ncrucially, were not exercises of judicial power, as is evident from\nthe fact that the Judiciary lacks authority to order settlement or\nestablish new tribunals. That is whyKleinwas not at issue\ninDames & Moore. By contrast, no comparable history\nsustains Congress\u2019s action here, which seeks to provide relief to\nrespondents not by transferring their claims in a manner only the\npolitical branches could do, but by commandeering the courts to\nmake a political judgment look like a judicial one. SeeMedell\u00ednv.Texas, 552 U.\u00a0S. 491, 531 (2008)\n(refusing to extend the President\u2019s claims-settlement authority\nbeyond the \u201cnarrow set of circumstances\u201d defined by the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to\nthe knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n(quotingDames & Moore, 453 U.\u00a0S., at 686)).If anything, whatDames & Moorereveals is that the political branches have extensive powers of\ntheir own in this area and could have chosen to exercise them to\ngive relief to the claimants in this case. Cf. 50\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71702(a)(1)(C) (authorizing the President, in\ncertain emergency circumstances, to confiscate and dispose of\nforeign sovereign property). The authority of the political\nbranches is sufficient; they have no need to seize ours.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*At issue here is a basic principle, not a\ntechnical rule. Section 8772 decides this case no less certainly\nthan if Congress had directed entry of judgment for respondents. As\na result, the potential of the decision today \u201cto effect important\nchange in the equilibrium of power\u201d is \u201cimmediately evident.\u201dMorrisonv.Olson, 487 U.\u00a0S. 654, 699 (1988)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting). Hereafter, with this Court\u2019s seal of\napproval, Congress can unabashedly pick the winners and losers in\nparticular pending cases. Today\u2019s decision will indeed become a\n\u201cblueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power\u201d at the\nJudiciary\u2019s expense,Metropolitan Washington Airports\nAuthorityv.Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise,\nInc., 501 U.\u00a0S. 252, 277 (1991) , feeding Congress\u2019s\ntendency to \u201cextend[\u00a0] the sphere of its activity and\ndraw[\u00a0] all power into its impetuous vortex,\u201d The Federalist\nNo. 48, at 309 (J. Madison).I respectfully dissent.Notes1The majority quarrels\nwith the description of \u00a78772 as being directed to a single case,\nnoting that the claimants had sought attachment of the assets in\nvarious prior proceedings.Ante,at 18. Those proceedings,\nhowever, were not simply consolidated below, but rather were joined\nin the single interpleader action that was referenced by docket\nnumber in \u00a78772. See \u00a78772(b). See generally 7 C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71702 (3d ed.\n2001) (explaining that interpleader is a \u201cjoinder device\u201d that\nbrings together multiple claimants to a piece of property in a\n\u201csingle\u201d action to \u201cprotect[\u00a0] the stakeholder from the\nvexation of multiple suits\u201d). That is presumably why respondents\ndid not dispute Bank Markazi\u2019s characterization of the proceedings\nas \u201ca single pending case\u201d when they opposed certiorari, Pet. for\nCert. i, and why the majority offers no citation to refute Wright\n& Miller\u2019s characterization of an interpleader action as a\n\u201csingle proceeding,\u201d 7 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71704. In any\nevent, nothing in the majority\u2019s opinion suggests that the result\nwould be different under its analysis even if it concluded that\nonly a single case were involved.2The majority instead\nseeks to recastKleinas being primarily about congressional\nimpairment of the President\u2019s pardon power,ante, at 14\u201315,\ndespiteKlein\u2019s unmistakable indication that the impairment\nof the pardon power was analternativeground for its\nholding, secondary to its Article III concerns. 13 Wall., at 147\n(\u201cThe rule prescribed isalsoliable to just exception as\nimpairing the effect of a pardon, and thus infringing the\nconstitutional power of the Executive.\u201d (emphasis added)). The\nmajority then suggests thatKleinstands simply for the\nproposition that Congress may not require courts to act\nunconstitutionally.Ante, at 14, and n. 19. That is without\ndoubt a good rule, recognized by this Court sinceMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). But it is hard to reconstructKleinalong these lines, given its focus on the threat to\nthe separation of powers from allowing Congress to manipulate\njurisdictional rules to dictate judicial results. See Hart, The\nPower of Congress To Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An\nExercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1362, 1373 (1953)\n(\u201c[I]f Congress directs an Article III court to decide a case, I\ncan easily read into Article III a limitation on the power of\nCongress to tell the courthowto decide it .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nas the Court itself made clear long ago inUnited States v.\nKlein.\u201d).3We have also upheld\nCongress\u2019s long practice of settling individual claims involving\npublic rights, such as claims against the Government, through\nprivate bills. See generallyPopev.United States,\n323 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1944) . But the Court points to no example of a\nprivate bill that retroactively changed the law for a single case\ninvolving private rights.",
