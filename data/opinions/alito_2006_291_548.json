S. ____ (2006)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-18ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF\nEDUCATION, PETITIONERv.PEARL MURPHY et viron writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[June 26, 2006]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA or Act) provides that a court \u201cmay award\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to parents who\nprevail in an action brought under the Act. 111 Stat. 92, 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). We granted certiorari to decide whether\nthis fee-shifting provision authorizes prevailing parents to\nrecover fees for services rendered by experts in IDEA actions. We\nhold that it does not.IRespondents Pearl and Theodore\nMurphy filed an action under the IDEA on behalf of their son,\nJoseph Murphy, seeking to require petitioner Arlington Central\nSchool District Board of Education to pay for their son\u2019s private\nschool tuition for specified school years. Respondents prevailed in\nthe District Court, 86 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY 2000), and the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 297 F.\u00a03d\n195 (2002).As prevailing parents,\nrespondents then sought $29,350 in fees for the services of an\neducational consultant, Marilyn Arons, who assisted respondents\nthroughout the IDEA proceedings. The District Court granted\nrespondents\u2019 request in part. It held that only the value of Arons\u2019\ntime spent between the hearing request and the ruling in\nrespondents\u2019 favor could properly be considered charges incurred in\nan \u201caction or proceeding brought\u201d under the Act, see 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). 2003 WL 21694398, *9 (SDNY, July 22,\n2003). This reduced the maximum recovery to $8,650. The District\nCourt also held that Arons, a nonlawyer, could be compensated only\nfor time spent on expert consulting services, not for time spent on\nlegal representation,id.,at *4, but it concluded that\nall the relevant time could be characterized as falling within the\ncompensable category, and thus allowed compensation for the full\n$8,650,id.,at *10.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed. 402 F.\u00a03d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other\nCircuits had taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that \u201cCongress intended to and did authorize\nthe reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA actions.\u201dId., at\n336. The court began by discussing two decisions of this Court\nholding that expert fees could not be recovered as taxed costs\nunder particular cost- or fee-shifting provisions. SeeCrawford\nFitting Co.v.J. T. Gibbons, Inc.,482 U. S. 437(1987) (interpreting\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d) and 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71920);West\nVirginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc.v.Casey,499 U. S. 83(1991) (interpreting 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the\ncourt noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read to\npermit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 indicating that Congress\nintended for that sort of fee-shifting.\u201d 402 F.\u00a03d, at\n336.Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by\na statement in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote inCaseythat\nmade reference to that Report. 402 F.\u00a03d, at 336\u2013337 (citing\nH.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\u2013687, p.\u00a05 (1986)). Based on these\nauthorities, the court concluded that it was required to interpret\nthe IDEA to authorize the award of the costs that prevailing\nparents incur in hiring experts. 402 F.\u00a03d, at 336.We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ____ (2006),\nto resolve the conflict among the Circuits with respect to whether\nCongress authorized the compensation of expert fees to prevailing\nparents in IDEA actions. CompareGoldringv.District\nof Columbia, 416 F.\u00a03d 70, 73\u201377 (CADC 2005);Neosho\nR-V School Dist.v.Clark ex rel. Clark, 315\nF.\u00a03d 1022, 1031\u20131033 (CA8 2003);T. D.v.LaGrange School Dist. No. 102, 349 F.\u00a03d 469, 480\u2013482\n(CA7 2003), with 402 F.\u00a03d 332 (CA2 2005). We now reverse.IIOur resolution of the question\npresented in this case is guided by the fact that Congress enacted\nthe IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 1; seeSchafferv.Weast, 546 U. S. ____\n(2005). Like its statutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal\nfunds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with\ndisabilities \u201cand conditions such funding upon a State\u2019s compliance\nwith extensive goals and procedures.\u201dBoard of Ed. of Hendrick\nHudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty.v.Rowley,458\nU. S. 176, 179 (1982).Congress has broad power to set\nthe terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, see,e.g.,South Dakotav.Dole,483 U. S. 203, 206\u2013207\n(1987), but when Congress attaches conditions to a State\u2019s\nacceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be set out\n\u201cunambiguously,\u201d seePennhurst State School and Hospitalv.Halderman,451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981);Rowley, supra, at 204, n.\u00a026. \u201c[L]egislation enacted\npursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a\ncontract,\u201d and therefore, to be bound by \u201cfederally imposed\nconditions,\u201d recipients of federal funds must accept them\n\u201cvoluntarily and knowingly.\u201dPennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17.\nStates cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are\n\u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to ascertain.\u201dIbid.\nThus, in the present case, we must view the IDEA from the\nperspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of\ndeciding whether the State should accept IDEA funds and the\nobligations that go with those funds. We must ask whether such a\nstate official would clearly understand that one of the obligations\nof the Act is the obligation to compensate prevailing parents for\nexpert fees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA furnishes\nclear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.IIIAIn considering whether the IDEA\nprovides clear notice, we begin with the text. We have \u201cstated time\nand again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201dConnecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain,503 U. S. 249, 253\u2013254\n(1992). When the statutory \u201clanguage is plain, the sole function of\nthe courts\u2014at least where the disposition required by the text is\nnot absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201dHartford\nUnderwriters Ins. Co.v.Union Planters Bank,\nN.\u00a0A.,530\nU. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quotingUnited Statesv.Ron\nPair Enterprises, Inc.,489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989), in turn quotingCaminettiv.United\nStates,242 U.\nS. 470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).The governing provision of the\nIDEA, 20 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), provides that \u201c[i]n any\naction or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its\ndiscretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the\ncosts\u201d to the parents of \u201ca child with a disability\u201d who is the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d While this provision provides for an award of\n\u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d this provision does not even hint\nthat acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for\nreimbursing prevailing parents for services rendered by\nexperts.Respondents contend that we should interpret\nthe term \u201ccosts\u201d in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage\nand that \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to \u201cauthorize\nreimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA proceedings,\nincluding expert costs.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17.This argument has multiple flaws. For one\nthing, as the Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018costs\u2019 is a term of art that generally does not include\nexpert fees.\u201d 402 F.\u00a03d, at 336. The use of this term of art,\nrather than a term such as \u201cexpenses,\u201d strongly suggests that\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provision that\nmakes participating States liable for all expenses incurred by\nprevailing parents in connection with an IDEA case\u2014for example,\ntravel and lodging expenses or lost wages due to time taken off\nfrom work. Moreover, contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion,\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not say that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d to\nprevailing parents; rather, it says that a court may award\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs\u201d to prevailing\nparents. This language simply adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that prevailing\nparents are otherwise entitled to recover. This list of otherwise\nrecoverable costs is obviously the list set out in 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71920, the general statute governing the taxation of costs in\nfederal court, and the recovery of witness fees under \u00a71920 is\nstrictly limited by \u00a71821, which authorizes travel reimbursement\nand a $40 per diem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize an award of any additional expert\nfees, and it certainly fails to provide the clear notice that is\nrequired under the Spending Clause.Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in\nthe same direction. While authorizing the award of reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that are\ndesigned to ensure that such awards are indeed reasonable. See\n\u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(C)\u2013(G). The absence of any comparable provisions\nrelating to expert fees strongly suggests that recovery of expert\nfees is not authorized. Moreover, the lack of any reference to\nexpert fees in \u00a71415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This\nprovision, which generally requires that parents receive \u201ca full\nexplanation of the procedural safeguards\u201d available under \u00a71415 and\nrefers expressly to \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d makes no mention of expert\nfees.BRespondents contend that their\ninterpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the\nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 that required the\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data, \u00a74(b)(3),\n100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision), but this provision\nis of little significance for present purposes. The GAO study\nprovision directed the Comptroller General, acting through the GAO,\nto compile data on, among other things: \u201c(A) the specific amount of\nattorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing\nparty\u201d in IDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys and\nconsultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and expenses\nincurred by the parents and the State educational agency and local\neducational agency.\u201dId.,at 797\u2013798.Subparagraph (A) would provide\nsome support for respondents\u2019 position if it directed the GAO to\ncompile data on awards to prevailing parties of the expense of\nhiring consultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.\nSubparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or experts or\ntheir fees.[Footnote 1]Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help\nrespondents. Subparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel, including \u2026\nconsultants,\u201d says nothing about the award of fees to such\nconsultants. Just because Congress directed the GAO to compile\nstatistics on the hours spent by consultants in IDEA cases, it does\nnot follow that Congress meant for States to compensate prevailing\nparties for the fees billed by these consultants.Respondents maintain that \u201cCongress\u2019 direction\nto the GAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate\nthat the expenses for \u2018consultants\u2019 would be recoverable,\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are many reasons\nwhy Congress might have wanted the GAO to gather data on expenses\nthat were not to be taxed as costs. Knowing the costs incurred by\nIDEA litigants might be useful in considering future procedural\namendments (which might affect these costs) or a future amendment\nregarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the GAO\nstudy provision covered expenses that could not be taxed as costs.\nFor example, the GAO was instructed to compile statistics on the\nhours spent by all attorneys involved in an IDEA action or\nproceeding, even though the Act did not provide for the recovery of\nattorney\u2019s fees by a prevailing state or local educational\nagency.[Footnote 2] Similarly,\nthe GAO was directed to compile data on \u201cexpenses incurred by the\nparents,\u201d not just those parents who prevail and are thus eligible\nto recover taxed costs.In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly\nsupport the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the\ncosts of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the IDEA\nfail to provide the clear notice that would be needed to attach\nsuch a condition to a State\u2019s receipt of IDEA funds.IVThus far, we have considered only\nthe text of the IDEA, but perhaps the strongest support for our\ninterpretation of the IDEA is supplied by our decisions and\nreasoning in Crawford Fitting,482 U. S. 437, andCasey,499 U. S. 83. In light of those\ndecisions, we do not see how it can be said that the IDEA gives a\nState unambiguous notice regarding liability for expert fees.InCrawford Fitting, the\nCourt rejected an argument very similar to respondents\u2019 argument\nthat the term \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an\nopen-ended reference to prevailing parents\u2019 expenses. It was argued\ninCrawford Fittingthat Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n54(d), which provides for the award of \u201ccosts\u201d to a prevailing\nparty, authorizes the award of costs not listed in 28 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71821. 482 U. S.,at 439. The Court held, however, that\nRule 54(d) does not give a district judge \u201cdiscretion to tax\nwhatever costs may seem appropriate\u201d; rather, the term \u201ccosts\u201d in\nRule 54(d) is defined by the list set out in \u00a71920.Id.,at 441. Because the recovery of witness fees, see \u00a71920(3), is\nstrictly limited by \u00a71821, the Court observed, a broader\ninterpretation of Rule 54(d) would mean that the Rule implicitly\neffected a partial repeal of those provisions.Id.,at\n442. But, the Court warned, \u201c[w]e will not lightly infer that\nCongress has repealed \u00a7\u00a71920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or\nany other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees.\u201dId., at 445.The reasoning ofCrawford Fittingstrongly supports the conclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is\ndefined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle,\nrecognized inCrawford Fitting,that no statute will be\nconstrued as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs\nunless the statute \u201crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\u201d 482 U.\nS., at 445; see alsoibid.(\u201cabsent explicit statutory or\ncontractual authorization for the taxation of the expenses of a\nlitigant\u2019s witness as costs, federal courts are bound by the\nlimitations set out in 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71821 and \u00a71920\u201d).Our decision inCaseyconfirms even\nmore dramatically that the IDEA does not authorize an award of\nexpert fees. InCasey, as noted above, we interpreted a\nfee-shifting provision, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988, the relevant\nwording of which was virtually identical to the wording of 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). Compareibid.(authorizing the\naward of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to\nprevailing parents) with 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988(b) (1988 ed.)\n(permitting prevailing parties in certain civil rights actions to\nbe awarded \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d). We\nheld that \u00a71988 did not empower a district court to award expert\nfees to a prevailing party.Casey,supra, at 102.\nTo decide in favor of respondents here, we would have to interpret\nthe virtually identical language in 20 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71415 as\nhaving exactly the opposite meaning. Indeed, we would have to go\nfurther and hold that the relevant language in the IDEAunambiguously meansexactly the opposite of what the\nnearly identical language in 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988 was held to\nmean inCasey.The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was\nheavily influenced by aCaseyfootnote, see 402\nF.\u00a03d, at 336\u2013337 (quoting 499 U. S., at 91\u201392, n.\u00a05),\nbut the court misunderstood the footnote\u2019s meaning. The text\naccompanying the footnote argued, based on an analysis of several\nfee-shifting statutes, that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d does not\ninclude expert fees.Id., at 88\u201391. In the footnote, we\ncommented on petitioners\u2019 invocation of the Conference Committee\nReport relating to 20 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), which stated:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018The conferees intend[ed] that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as\npart of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of expert\nwitnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which\nis found to be necessary for the preparation of the \u2026 case.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n499 U. S., at 91\u201392, n.\u00a05 (quoting H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No.\n99\u2013687, at 5; ellipsis in original). This statement, the footnote\ncommented, was \u201can apparent effort todepartfrom ordinary\nmeaning and to define a term of art.\u201d 499 U. S., at 92, n.\u00a05.\nThe footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set\nout the correct interpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), much less that\nthe Report was sufficient, despite the language of the statute, to\nprovide the clear notice required under the Spending Clause. The\nthrust of the footnote was simply that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d\nstanding alone, is generally not understood as encompassing expert\nfees. Thus,Crawford FittingandCaseystrongly\nreinforce the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously\nauthorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.VRespondents make several\narguments that are not based on the text of the IDEA, but these\narguments do not show that the IDEA provides clear notice regarding\nthe award of expert fees.Respondents argue that their\ninterpretation of the IDEA furthers the Act\u2019s overarching goal of\n\u201censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to\nthem a free appropriate public education,\u201d 20 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71400(d)(1)(A) as well as the goal of \u201csafeguard[ing] the rights of\nparents to challenge school decisions that adversely affect their\nchild.\u201d Brief for Respondents 20. These goals, however, are too\ngeneral to provide much support for respondents\u2019 reading of the\nterms of the IDEA. The IDEA obviously does not seek to promote\nthese goals at the expense of all other considerations, including\nfiscal considerations. Because the IDEA is not intended in all\ninstances to further the broad goals identified by the respondents\nat the expense of fiscal considerations, the goals cited by\nrespondents do little to bolster their argument on the narrow\nquestion presented here.[Footnote\n3]Finally, respondents vigorously argue that\nCongress clearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated\nfor expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of \u00a71415 and\nin particular on the following statement in the Conference\nCommittee Report, discussed above: \u201cThe conferees intend that the\nterm \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019 include reasonable\nexpenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of\nany test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the\npreparation of the \u2026 case.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\u2013687,\nat\u00a05.Whatever weight this legislative history would\nmerit in another context, it is not sufficient here. Putting the\nlegislative history aside, we see virtually no support for\nrespondents\u2019 position. Under these circumstances, where everything\nother than the legislative history overwhelming suggests that\nexpert fees may not be recovered, the legislative history is simply\nnot enough. In a Spending Clause case, the key is not what a\nmajority of the Members of both Houses intend but what the States\nare clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the\nacceptance of those funds. Here, in the face of the unambiguous\ntext of the IDEA and the reasoning inCrawford FittingandCasey, we cannot say that the legislative history on which\nrespondents rely is sufficient to provide the requisite fair\nnotice.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Because subparagraph (A) refers to both\n\u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d awarded to prevailing parties and because it\nis generally presumed that statutory language is not superfluous,\nit could be argued that this provision manifests the expectation\nthat prevailing parties would be awarded certain \u201cexpenses\u201d not\nincluded in the list of \u201ccosts\u201d set out in 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71920\nand that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumerated\n\u201cexpenses.\u201d This argument fails because, whatever expectation this\nlanguage might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes\nthe award of any \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts.\u201d Recognizing this,\nrespondents argue not that they are entitled to recover \u201cexpenses\u201d\nthat are not \u201ccosts,\u201d but that expert feesarerecoverable\n\u201ccosts.\u201d As a result, the reference to awards of both \u201cexpenses\u201d\nand \u201ccosts\u201d does not support respondents\u2019 position. The reference\nto \u201cexpenses\u201d may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court,\n\u00a71415(i)(2)(A), where \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts\u201d might be\nreceivable. Or the reference may be surplusage. While it is\ngenerally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage,\ninstances of surplusage are not unknown.Footnote 2In 2000, the attorneys\u2019 fees provision\nprovided only an award to prevailing parents. See 20 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B). In 2004, Congress amended \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) to include\ntwo additional awards. See \u00a7101, 118 Stat. 2724. The amendments\nprovided awards \u201cto a prevailing party who is a State educational\nagency or local educational agency\u201d where the complaint filed is\nfrivolous or presented for an improper purpose, such as to harass,\ndelay, or increase the cost of litigation. See 20 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2006).Footnote 3Respondents note that a GAO report stated\nthat expert witness fees are reimbursable expenses. See Brief for\nRespondents 19 (citing GAO, Special Education: The Attorney Fees\nProvision of Public Law 99\u2013372, p. 13 (Nov. 1989)). But this\npassing reference in a report issued by an agency not responsible\nfor implementing the IDEA is plainly insufficient to provide clear\nnotice regarding the scope of the conditions attached to the\nreceipt of IDEA funds.",
