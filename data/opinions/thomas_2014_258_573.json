JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING\nFUND, INC.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2014]Justice Thomas, with\nwhom Justice Scalia and Justice Alito join, concurring in the\njudgment.The implied Rule\n10b\u20135 private cause of action is \u201ca relic of the heady\ndays in which this Court assumedcommon-law powers to create causes\nof action,\u201d Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S.\n61, 75 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring); see, e.g., J. I. Case Co.\nv. Borak, 377 U.\u00a0S. 426, 433 (1964) . We have since ended that\npractice because the authority to fashion private remedies to\nenforce federal law belongs to Congress alone. Stone-ridge\nInvestment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552\nU.\u00a0S. 148, 164 (2008) . Absent statutory authorization for a\ncause of action, \u201ccourts may not create one, no matter how\ndesirable that might be as a policy matter.\u201d Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.\u00a0S. 275 \u2013287 (2001).Basic Inc. v. Levinson,\n485 U.\u00a0S. 224 (1988) , demonstrates the wisdom of this rule.\nBasic presented the question how investors must prove the reliance\nelement of the implied Rule 10b\u20135 cause of action\u2014the\nrequirement that the plaintiff buy or sell stock in reliance on the\ndefendant\u2019s misstatement\u2014when they transact on modern,\nimpersonal securities exchanges. Were the Rule 10b\u20135 action\nstatu-tory, the Court could have resolved this question by\ninterpreting the statutory language. Without a statute to interpret\nfor guidance, however, the Court began instead with a particular\npolicy \u201cproblem\u201d: for investors in impersonal markets,\nthe traditional reliance requirement was hard to prove and\nimpossible to prove as common among plaintiffs bringing 10b\u20135\nclass-action suits. Id., at 242, 245. With the task thus framed as\n\u201cresol[ving]\u201d that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018problem\u2019\u00a0\u201d rather than\ninterpreting statutory text, id., at 242, the Court turned to\nnascent economic theory and naked intuitions about investment\nbehavior in its efforts to fashion a new, easier way to meet the\nreliance requirement. The result was an evidentiary presumption,\nbased on a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory, that paved the\nway for class actions under Rule 10b\u20135.Today we are asked to\ndetermine whether Basic was correctly decided. The Court suggests\nthat it was, and that stare decisis demands that we preserve it. I\ndisagree. Logic, economic realities, and our subsequent\njurisprudence have undermined the foundations of the Basic\npresumption, and stare decisis cannot prop up the fa\u00e7ade\nthat remains. Basic should be overruled.IUnderstanding where\nBasic went wrong requires an explanation of the\n\u201creliance\u201d requirement as traditionally understood.\u201cReliance by the\nplaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s deceptive acts is an essential\nelement\u201d of the implied 10b\u20135 private cause of\naction.[1] Stoneridge, supra,\nat 159. To prove reliance, the plaintiff must show\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018transaction causation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\ni.e., that the specific misstatement induced \u201cthe\ninvestor\u2019s decision to engage in the transaction.\u201d\nErica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 6\u20137). Such proof\n\u201censures that there is a proper \u2018connection between a\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\u2019s\ninjury\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014namely, that the plaintiff has not\njust lost money as a result of the misstatement, but that he was\nactually defrauded by it. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see also\nDirks v. SEC, 463 U.\u00a0S. 646 \u2013667, n. 27 (1983)\n(\u201c[T]o constitute a violation of Rule 10b\u20135, there must\nbe fraud.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]here always are winners and\nlosers; but those who have \u2018lost\u2019 have not necessarily\nbeen defrauded\u201d). Without that connection, Rule 10b\u20135\nis reduced to a \u201c\u00a0\u2018scheme of investor\u2019s\ninsurance,\u2019\u00a0\u201d because a plaintiff could recover\nwhenever the defendant\u2019s misstatement distorted the stock\nprice\u2014regardless of whether the misstatement had actually\ntricked the plaintiff into buying (or selling) the stock in the\nfirst place. Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.\u00a0S.\n336, 345 (2005) (quoting Basic, supra, at 252 (White, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part)).The\n\u201ctraditional\u201d reliance element requires a plaintiff to\n\u201csho[w] that he was aware of a company\u2019s statement and\nengaged in a relevant transaction .\u00a0.\u00a0. based on that\nspe-cific misrepresentation.\u201d Erica P. John Fund, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 4). But investors who purchase stock from third\nparties on impersonal exchanges (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange)\noften will not be aware of any particular statement made by the\nissuer of the security, and therefore cannot establish that they\ntransacted based on a specific misrepresentation. Nor is the\ntraditional reliance requirement amenable to class treatment; the\ninherently individualized nature of the reliance inquiry renders it\nimpossible for a 10b\u20135 plaintiff to prove that common\nquestions predominate over individual ones, making class\ncertification improper. See Basic, supra, at 242; Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 23(b)(3).Citing these\ndifficulties of proof and class certification, 485 U.\u00a0S., at\n242, 245, the Basic Court dispensed with the traditional reliance\nrequirement in favor of a new one based on the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory.[2] The new version of\nreliance had two related parts.First, Basic suggested\nthat plaintiffs could meet the reliance requirement\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018indirectly,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 245.\nThe Court reasoned that \u201c\u00a0\u2018ideally, [the market]\ntransmits information to the investor in the processed form of a\nmarket price.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 244. An investor could\nthus be said to have \u201crelied\u201d on a specific\nmisstatement if (1) the market had incorporated that statement into\nthe market price of the security, and (2) the investor then bought\nor sold that security \u201cin reliance on the integrity of the\n[market] price,\u201d id., at 247, i.e., based on his belief that\nthe market price\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018reflect[ed]\u2019\u00a0\u201d the\nstock\u2019s underlying\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018value,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 244.Second, Basic created a\npresumption that this \u201cindirect\u201d form of\n\u201creliance\u201d had been proved. Based primarily on certain\nassumptions about economic theory and investor behavior, Basic\nafforded plaintiffs who traded in efficient markets an evidentiary\npresumption that both steps of the novel reliance requirement had\nbeen satisfied\u2014that (1) the market had incorporated the\nspecific misstatement into the market price of the security, and\n(2) the plaintiff did transact in reliance on the integrity of that\nprice.[3] Id., at 247. A\ndefendant was ostensibly entitled to rebut the presumption by\nputting forth evidence that either of those steps was absent. Id.,\nat 248.IIBasic\u2019s\nreimagined reliance requirement was a mistake, and the passage of\ntime has compounded its failings. First, the Court based both parts\nof the presumption of reliance on a questionable understanding of\ndisputed economic theory and flawed intuitions about investor\nbehavior. Second, Basic\u2019s rebuttable presumption is at odds\nwith our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require plaintiffs seeking\nclass certification to \u201c\u00a0\u2018affirmatively\ndemonstrate\u2019\u00a0\u201d certification requirements like the\npredominance of common questions. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10)). Finally, Basic\u2019s presumption that investors rely on the\nintegrity of the market price is virtually irrebuttable in\npractice, which means that the \u201cessential\u201d reliance\nelement effectively exists in name only.ABasic based the\npresumption of reliance on two factual assumptions. The first\nassumption was that, in a \u201cwell-developed market,\u201d\npublic statements are generally \u201creflected\u201d in the\nmarket price of securities. 485 U.\u00a0S., at 247. The second was\nthat investors in such markets transact \u201cin reliance on the\nintegrity of that price.\u201d Ibid. In other words, the Court\ncreated a presumption that a plaintiff had met the two-part,\nfraud-on-the-market version of the reliance requirement because, in\nthe Court\u2019s view, \u201ccommon sense and probability\u201d\nsuggested that each of those parts would be met. Id., at 246.In reality, both of the\nCourt\u2019s key assumptions are highly contestable and do not\nprovide the necessary support for Basic\u2019s presumption of\nreliance. The first assumption\u2014that public statements are\n\u201creflected\u201d in the market price\u2014was grounded in\nan economic theory that hasgarnered substantial criticism since\nBasic. The second as-sumption\u2014that investors categorically\nrely on the integrity of the market price\u2014is simply\nwrong.1The Court\u2019s\nfirst assumption was that \u201cmost publicly available\ninformation\u201d\u2014including public\nmisstatements\u2014\u201cis reflected in [the] market\nprice\u201d of a security. Id., at 247. The Court grounded that\nassumption in \u201cempirical studies\u201d testing a\nthen-nascent economic theory known as the efficient capital markets\nhypothesis. Id., at 246\u2013247. Specifically, the Court relied\nupon the \u201csemi-strong\u201d version of that theory, which\nposits that the average investor cannot earn above-market returns\n(i.e., \u201cbeat the market\u201d) in an efficient market by\ntrading on the basis of publicly available information. See, e.g.,\nStout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction to\nthe New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 640, and n. 24 (2003) (citing\nFama, Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical\nWork, 25 J. Finance 383, 388 (1970)).[4] The upshot of the hypothesis is that \u201cthe market\nprice of shares traded on well-developed markets [will] reflec[t]\nall publicly available information, and, hence, any material\nmisrepresentations.\u201d Basic, supra, at 246. At the time of\nBasic, this version of the efficient capital markets hypothesis was\n\u201cwidely accepted.\u201d See Dunbar & Heller\n463\u2013464.This view of market\nefficiency has since lost its luster. See, e.g., Langevoort, Basic\nat Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L.\u00a0Rev.\n151, 175 (\u201cDoubts about the strength and pervasiveness of\nmarket efficiency are much greater today than they were in the\nmid-1980s\u201d). As it turns out, even\n\u201cwell-developed\u201d markets (like the New York Stock\nExchange) do not uniformly incorporate information into market\nprices with high speed. \u201c[F]riction in accessing public\ninformation\u201d and the presence of \u201cprocessing\ncosts\u201d means that \u201cnot all public information will be\nimpounded in a security\u2019s price with the same alacrity, or\nperhaps with any quickness at all.\u201d Cox, Understanding\nCausation in Private Securities Lawsuits: Building on Amgen, 66\nVand. L.\u00a0Rev. 1719, 1732 (2013) (hereinafter Cox). For\nexample, information that is easily digestible (merger\nannouncements or stock splits) or especially prominent (Wall Street\nJournal articles) may be incorporated quickly, while information\nthat is broadly applicable or technical (Securities and Exchange\nCommission filings) may be incorporated slowly or even ignored. See\nStout, supra, at 653\u2013656; see e.g., In\u00a0re Merck &\nCo. Securities Litigation, 432 F.\u00a03d 261, 263\u2013265 (CA3\n2005) (a Wall Street Journal article caused a steep decline in the\ncompany\u2019s stock price even though the same information was\ncontained in an earlier SEC disclosure).Further, and more\nimportantly, \u201coverwhelming empirical evidence\u201d now\nsuggests that even when markets do incorporate public information,\nthey often fail to do so accurately. Lev and de Villiers, Stock\nPrice Crashes and 10b\u20135 Damages: A Legal, Economic and Policy\nAnalysis, 47 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. 7, 20\u201321 (1994); see also\nid., at 21 (\u201cThat many share price movements seem unrelated\nto specific information strongly suggests that capital markets are\nnot fundamentally efficient, and that wide deviations from\nfundamentals .\u00a0.\u00a0. can occur\u201d(footnote omitted)).\n\u201cScores\u201d of \u201cefficiency-defying\nanomalies\u201d\u2014such as market swings in the absence of new\ninformation and prolonged deviations from underlying asset\nvalues\u2014make market efficiency \u201cmore contestable than\never.\u201d Langevoort, Taming the Animal Spirits of the Stock\nMarkets: A Behavioral Approach to Securities Regulation, 97 Nw. U.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 135, 141 (2002); Dunbar & Heller 476\u2013483.\nSuch anomalies make it difficult to tell whether, at any given\nmoment, a stock\u2019s price accurately reflects its value as\nindicated by all publicly available information. In sum, economists\nnow understand that the price impact Basic assumed would happen\nreflexively is actually far from certain even in\n\u201cwell-developed\u201d markets. Thus, Basic\u2019s claim\nthat \u201ccommon sense and probability\u201d support a\npresumption of reliance rests on shaky footing.2The Basic Court also\ngrounded the presumption of reliance in a second assumption: that\n\u201c[a]n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by\nthe market does so in reliance on the integrity of that\nprice.\u201d 485 U.\u00a0S., at 247. In other words, the Court\nassumed that investors transact based on the belief that the market\nprice accurately reflects the underlying\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018value\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the security. See\nid., at 244 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[P]urchasers generally rely on the\nprice of the stock as a reflection of its\nvalue\u2019\u00a0\u201d). The Basic Court appears to have adopted\nthis assumption about investment behavior based only on what it\nbelieved to be \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Id., at 246. The Court\nfound it \u201c\u00a0\u2018hard to imagine that there ever is a\nbuyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity. Who would\nknowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nId., at 246\u2013247.The Court\u2019s\nrather superficial analysis does not withstand scrutiny. It cannot\nbe seriously disputed that a great many investors do not buy or\nsell stock based on a belief that the stock\u2019s price\naccurately reflects its value. Many investors in fact trade for the\nopposite reason\u2014that is, because they think the market has\nunder- or overvalued the stock, and they believe they can profit\nfrom that mispricing. Id., at 256 (opinion of White, J.); see,\ne.g., Macey, The Fraud on the Market Theory: Some Preliminary\nIssues, 74 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 923, 925 (1989) (The\n\u201copposite\u201d of Basic\u2019s assumption appears to be\ntrue; some investors \u201cattempt to locate undervalued stocks in\nan effort to \u2018beat the market\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. in\nessence betting that the market .\u00a0.\u00a0. is in fact\ninefficient\u201d). Indeed, securities transactions often take\nplace because the transacting parties disagree on the\nsecurity\u2019s value. See, e.g., Stout, Are Stock Markets Costly\nCasinos? Disagreement, Mar-ket Failure, and Securities Regulation,\n81 Va. L.\u00a0Rev.611, 619 (1995) (\u201c[A]vailable evidence\nsuggests that .\u00a0.\u00a0. in-vestor disagreement inspires the\nlion\u2019s share of equities transactions\u201d).Other investors trade\nfor reasons entirely unrelated to price\u2014for instance, to\naddress changing liquidity needs, tax concerns, or portfolio\nbalancing requirements. See id., at 657\u2013658; see also Cox\n1739 (investors may purchase \u201cdue to portfolio rebalancing\narising from its obeisance to an indexing strategy\u201d). These\ninvestment decisions\u2014made with indifference to price and thus\nwithout regard for price \u201cintegrity\u201d\u2014are at odds\nwith Basic\u2019s understanding of what motivates investment\ndecisions. In short, Basic\u2019s assumption that all investors\nrely in common on \u201cprice integrity\u201d is simply\nwrong.[5]The majority tries (but\nfails) to reconcile Basic\u2019s assumption about investor\nbehavior with the reality that many investors do not behave in the\nway Basic assumed. It first asserts that Basic rested only on the\nmore modest view that \u201c\u00a0\u2018most\ninvestors\u2019\u00a0\u201d rely on the integrity of a\nsecurity\u2019s market price. Ante, at 12 (quoting not Basic, but\nAmgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds, 568\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5) (emphasis added)). That\ngloss is difficult to square with Basic\u2019s plain language:\n\u201cAn investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the\nmarket does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\u201d\nBasic, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 247; see also id., at 246\u2013247\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018[I]t is hard to imagine that there ever is a\nbuyer or seller who does not rely on market\nintegrity\u2019\u00a0\u201d). In any event, neither Basic nor the\nmajority offers anything more than a judicial hunch as evidence\nthat even \u201cmost\u201d investors rely on price integrity.The majority also\nsuggests that \u201cthere is no reason to suppose\u201d that\ninvestors who buy stock they believe to be undervalued are\n\u201cindifferent to the integrity of market prices.\u201d Ante,\nat 12. Such \u201cvalue investor[s],\u201d according to the\nmajority, \u201cimplicitly rel[y] on the fact that a stock\u2019s\nmarket price will eventually reflect material information\u201d\nand \u201cpresumably tr[y] to estimate how undervalued or\novervalued a particular stock is\u201d by reference to the market\nprice. Ibid. Whether the majority\u2019s unsupported claims about\nthe thought processes of hypothetical investors are accurate or\nnot, they are surely beside the point. Whatever else an investor\nbelieves about the market, he simply does not \u201crely on the\nintegrity of the market price\u201d if he does not believe that\nthe market price accurately reflects public information at the time\nhe transacts. That is, an investor cannot claim that a public\nmisstatement induced his transaction by distorting the market price\nif he did not buy at that price while believing that it accurately\nincorporated that public information. For that sort of investor,\nBasic\u2019s critical fiction falls apart.BBasic\u2019s\npresumption of reliance also conflicts with our more recent cases\nclarifying Rule 23\u2019s class-certification requirements. Those\ncases instruct that \u201ca party seeking to maintain a class\naction \u2018must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance\u2019\nwith Rule 23.\u201d Comcast, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n5) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). To\nprevail on a motion for class certification, a party must\ndemonstrate through \u201cevidentiary proof\u201d that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n5\u20136) (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)).Basic permits\nplaintiffs to bypass that requirement of evidentiary proof. Under\nBasic, plaintiffs who invoke the presumption of reliance (by\nproving its predicates) are deemed to have met the predominance\nrequirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See ante, at 14; Amgen, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 6) (Basic \u201cfacilitates class certification by\nrecognizing a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance\u201d);\nBasic, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 242, 250 (holding that the District Court\nappropriately certified the class based on the presumption of\nreliance). But, invoking the Basic presumption does not actually\nprove that individual questions of reliance will not overwhelm the\ncommon questions in the case. Basic still requires a showing that\nthe individual investor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity\nof the market price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut the\npresumption by producing evidence that individual plaintiffs do not\nmeet that description. See id., at 249 (\u201cPetitioners\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. could rebut the presumption of reliance as to\nplaintiffs who would have divested themselves of their Basic shares\nwithout relying on the integrity of the market\u201d). Thus, by\nits own terms, Basic entitles defendants to ask each class member\nwhether he traded in reliance on the integrity of the market price.\nThat inquiry, like the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently\nindividualized; questions about the trading strategies of\nindividual investors will not generate \u201c\u00a0\u2018common\nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the\nlitigation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Wal-Mart Stores, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). See supra, at 8\u20139; see also Cox 1736, n.\n55 (Basic\u2019s recognition that defendants could rebut the\npresumption \u201cby proof the investor would have traded anyway\nappears to require individual inquiries into reliance\u201d).Basic thus exempts Rule\n10b\u20135 plaintiffs from Rule 23\u2019s proof requirement.\nPlaintiffs who invoke the presumption of reliance are deemed to\nhave shown predominance as a matter of law, even though the\nresulting rebuttable presumption leaves individualized questions of\nreliance in the case and predominance still unproved. Needless to\nsay, that exemption was beyond the Basic Court\u2019s power to\ngrant.[6]CIt would be bad\nenough if Basic merely provided an end-run around Rule 23. But in\npractice, the so-called \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d is\nlargely irrebuttable.The Basic Court\nostensibly afforded defendants an opportunity to rebut the\npresumption by providing evidence that either aspect of a\nplaintiff\u2019s fraud-on-the-market reliance\u2014price impact,\nor reliance on the integrity of the market price\u2014is missing.\n485 U.\u00a0S., at 248\u2013249. As it turns out, however, the\nrealities of class-action procedure make rebuttal based on an\nindividual plaintiff\u2019s lack of reliance virtually impossible.\nAt the class-certification stage, rebuttal is only directed at the\nclass representatives, which means that counsel only needs to find\none class member who can withstand the challenge. See Grundfest,\nDamages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 69\nBus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After class certification, courts have\nrefused to allow defendants to challenge any plaintiff\u2019s\nreliance on the integrity of the market price prior to a\ndetermination on classwide liability. See Brief for Chamber of\nCommerce of the United States of America et\u00a0al. as Amici\nCuriae 13\u201314 (collecting cases rejecting postcertification\nattempts to rebut individual class members\u2019 reliance on price\nintegrity as not pertinent to classwide liability). One search for\nrebuttals on individual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases\nout of the thousands of Rule 10b\u20135 actions brought since\nBasic. Grundfest, supra, at 360.[7]The apparent\nunavailability of this form of rebuttal has troubling implications.\nBecause the presumption is conclusive in practice with respect to\ninvestors\u2019 reliance on price integrity, even Basic\u2019s\nwatered-down reliance requirement has been effectively eliminated.\nOnce the presumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an\nobstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many class members\nwill not have transacted in reliance on price integrity, see supra,\nat 8\u20139. And without a func-tional reliance requirement, the\n\u201cessential element\u201d that ensures the plaintiff has\nactually been defrauded, see Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 159, Rule\n10b\u20135 becomes the very \u201c\u00a0\u2018scheme of\ninvestor\u2019s insurance\u2019\u00a0\u201d the rebuttable\npresumption was supposed to prevent. See Basic, supra, at 252\n(opinion of White, J.).[8]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons,\nBasic should be overruled in favor of the straightforward rule that\n\u201c[r]eliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s\ndeceptive acts\u201d\u2014actual reliance, not the fictional\n\u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d version\u2014\u201cis an\nessential element of the \u00a710(b) private cause of\naction.\u201d Stone-ridge, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 159.IIIPrinciples of stare\ndecisis do not compel us to save Basic\u2019s muddled logic and\narmchair economics. We have not hesitated to overrule decisions\nwhen they are \u201cunworkable or are badly reasoned,\u201d Payne\nv. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 827 (1991) ; when \u201cthe\ntheoretical underpinnings of those decisions are called into\nserious question,\u201d State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.\u00a0S. 3,\n21 (1997) ; when the decisions have become\n\u201cirreconcilable\u201d with intervening developments in\n\u201ccompeting legal doctrines or policies,\u201d Patterson v.\nMcLean Credit Union, 491 U.\u00a0S. 164, 173 (1989) ; or when they\nare otherwise \u201ca positive detriment to coherence and\nconsistency in the law,\u201d ibid. Just one of these\ncircumstances can justify our correction of bad precedent; Basic\nchecks all the boxes.In support of its\ndecision to preserve Basic, the majority contends that stare\ndecisis \u201chas \u2018special force\u2019 \u2018in respect to\nstatutory interpretation\u2019 because \u2018Congress remains\nfree to alter what we have done.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ante, at 12\n(quoting John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\nU.\u00a0S. 130, 139 (2008) ; some internal quotation marks\nomitted). But Basic, of course, has nothing to do with statutory\ninterpretation. The case concerned a judge-made evidentiary\npresumption for a judge-made element of the implied 10b\u22125\nprivate cause of action, itself \u201ca judicial construct that\nCongress did not enact in the text of the relevant statutes.\u201d\nStoneridge, supra, at 164. We have not afforded stare decisis\n\u201cspecial force\u201d outside the context of statu-tory\ninterpretation, see Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2014) (Thomas,\u00a0J. dissenting) (slip\nop., at 15, n.\u00a06 and for good reason. In statutory cases, it\nis perhaps plausible that Congress watches over its enactments and\nwill step in to fix our mistakes, so we may leave to Congress the\njudgment whether the interpretive question is better left\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018settled\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018settled right,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Square D Co.\nv. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U.\u00a0S. 409, 424\n(1986) . But this rationale is untenable when it comes to\njudge-made law like \u201cimplied\u201d private causes of action,\nwhich we retain a duty to superintend. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping\nCo. v. Baker, 554 U.\u00a0S. 471, 507 (2008) (\u201c[T]he\njudiciary [cannot] wash its hands of a problem it created\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. simply by calling [the judicial doctrine]\nlegislative\u201d). Thus, when we err in areas of judge-made law,\nwe ought to presume that Congress expects us to correct our own\nmistakes\u2014not the other way around. That duty is especially\nclear in the Rule 10b\u20135 context, where we have said that\n\u201c[t]he federal courts have accepted and exercised the\nprincipal responsibility for the continuing elaboration of the\nscope of the 10b\u20135 right and the definition of the duties it\nimposes.\u201d Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of\nWausau, 508 U.\u00a0S. 286, 292 (1993) .Basic\u2019s\npresumption of reliance remains our mistake to correct. Since\nBasic, Congress has enacted two major securities laws: the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109Stat. 737, and\nthe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA),\n112Stat. 3227. The PSLRA \u201csought to combat perceived abuses\nin securities litigation,\u201d ante, at 15, and SLUSA prevented\nplaintiffs from avoiding the PSLRA\u2019s restrictions by bringing\nclass actions in state court, ibid. Neither of these Acts touched\nthe reliance element of the implied Rule 10b\u20135 private cause\nof action or the Basic presumption.Contrary to\nrespondent\u2019s argument (the majority wisely skips this next\nline of defense), we cannot draw from Congress\u2019 silence on\nthis matter an inference that Congress approved of Basic. To begin\nwith, it is inappropriate to give weight to \u201cCongress\u2019\nunenacted opinion\u201d when construing judge-made doctrines,\nbecause doing so allows the Court to create law and then\n\u201ceffectively codif[y]\u201d it \u201cbased only on\nCongress\u2019 failure to address it.\u201d Bay Mills, supra, at\n___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 14). Our Constitution,\nhowever, demands that laws be passed by Congress and signed by the\nPresident. U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a77. Adherence to Basic\nbased on congressional inaction would invert that requirement by\ninsulating error from correction merely because Congress failed to\npass a law on the subject. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 175, n.\u00a01\n(\u201cCongressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted\nstatute\u201d).At any rate, arguments\nfrom legislative inaction are speculative at best. \u201c[I]t is\n\u2018\u00a0\u201cimpossible to assert with any degree of\nassurance that congressional failure to act represents\u201d\naffirmative congressional approval of\u2019 one of this\nCourt\u2019s decisions.\u201d Bay Mills, supra, at ___\n(Thomas,\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Patterson,\nsupra, at 175, n. 1). \u201c\u00a0\u2018Congressional inaction\nlacks persuasive significance\u2019\u00a0\u201d because it is\nindeterminate; \u201c\u00a0\u2018several equally tenable\ninferences may be drawn from such inaction.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,\nN. A., 511 U.\u00a0S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.\u00a0S. 633, 650 (1990)\n). Therefore, \u201c[i]t does not follow .\u00a0.\u00a0. that\nCongress\u2019 failure to overturn a .\u00a0.\u00a0. precedent is\nreason for this Court to adhere to it.\u201d Patterson, supra, at\n175, n.\u00a01.That is especially true\nhere, because Congress passed a law to tell us not to draw any\ninference from its inaction. The PSLRA expressly states that\n\u201c[n]othing in this Act .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be deemed to\ncreate or ratify any implied private right of action.\u201d Notes\nfollowing 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j\u20131, p. 430. If the\nAct did not ratify even the Rule 10b\u20135 private cause of\naction, it cannot be read to ratify sub silentio the presumption of\nreliance this Court affixed to that action. Further, the PSLRA and\nSLUSA operate to curtail abuses of various private causes of action\nunder our securities laws\u2014hardly an indication that Congress\napproved of Basic\u2019s expansion of the 10b\u20135 private\ncause of action. Congress\u2019 failure to overturn Basic does not\npermit us to \u201cplace on the shoulders of Congress the burden\nof the Court\u2019s own error.\u201d Girouard v. United States,\n328 U.\u00a0S. 61, 70 (1946) .*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Basic took an implied\ncause of action and grafted on a policy-driven presumption of\nreliance based on nascent economic theory and personal intuitions\nabout investment behavior. The result was an unrecognizably broad\ncause of action ready made for class certification. Time and\nexperience have pointed up the error of that decision, making it\nall too clear that the Court\u2019s attempt to revise securities\nlaw to fit the alleged \u201cnew realities of financial\nmarkets\u201d should have been left to Congress. 485 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 255 (opinion of White, J.).Notes1As the private Rule\n10b\u20135 action has evolved, the Court has drawn on the\ncommon-law action of deceit to identify six elements a private\nplaintiff must prove: \u201c\u00a0\u2018(1) a material\nmisrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a\nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the\npurchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the\nmisrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d v. , 568 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2013) (slip op., at 3\u20134).2In the years preceding ,\nlower courts and commentators experimented with various ways to\nfacilitate 10b\u20135 class actions by relaxing or eliminating the\nreliance element of the implied 10b\u20135 action. See, , v. , 524\nF.\u00a02d 891 (CA9 1975); Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 95\nHarv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982); Note, The Reliance Requirement in\nPrivate Actions under SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 584,\n592\u2013606 (1975). The \u201cfraud-on-the-market theory\u201d\nis an umbrella term for those varied efforts. Black, Fraud on the\nMarket: A Criticism of Dispensing with Reliance Requirements in\nCertain Open Market Transactions, 62 N. C. L. Rev. 435,\n439\u2013457 (1984).3An investor could invoke\nthis presumption by demonstrating certain predicates: (1) a public\nstatement; (2) an efficient market; (3) that the shares were traded\nafter the statement was made but before the truth was revealed; and\n(4) that the statement was material. 485 U.\u00a0S. at 248, n.\n27.4The \u201cweak\nform\u201d of the hypothesis provides that an investor cannot earn\nan above-market return by trading on historical price data. See\nDunbar & Heller, Fraud on the Market Meets Behavioral Finance,\n31 Del. J. Corporate L. 455, 463\u2013464 (2006) (hereinafter\nDunbar & Heller). The \u201cstrong form\u201d provides that\ninvestors cannot achieve above-market returns even by trading on\nnonpublic information. See The weak form is generally accepted; the\nstrong form is not. See5The Court\u2019s\nmistaken intuition about investor behavior appears to involve a\ncategory mistake: the Court invoked a hypothesis meant to describe\nmarkets, but then used it \u201cin the one way it is not meant to\nbe used: as a predictor of the behavior of individual\ninvestors.\u201d Langevoort, Theories, Assumptions, and Securities\nRegulation: Market Efficiency Revisited, 140 U.\u00a0Pa.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 851, 895 (1992). The efficient capital markets\nhypothesis does not describe \u201chow investors behave; [it] only\nsuggests the consequences of their collective behavior.\u201d Cox\n1736. \u201cNothing in the hypothesis denies what most popular\naccounts assume: that much information searching and trading by\ninvestors, from institutions on down, is done in the (perhaps\nerroneous) belief that undervalued or overvalued stocks exist and\ncan systematically be discovered.\u201d Langevoort, Theories, at\n895.6The majority suggests\nthat squares with v. , 569 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), and v. , 564\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), because it does not \u201crelieve\nplaintiffs of the burden of proving .\u00a0.\u00a0.\npredominance\u201d but \u201crather sets forth what they must\nprove to demonstrate such predominance.\u201d at 14\u201315. This\nargument misses the point. Because offers defendants a chance to\nrebut the presumption on individualized grounds, the predicates\nthat sets forth as sufficient to invoke the presumption do not\nnecessarily prove predominance.7The absence of\npostcertification rebuttal is likely attributable in part to the\nsubstantial settlement pressures brought to bear by certification.\nSee, Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof,\n84 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0U. L. Rev. 97, 99 (2009) (\u201cWith\nvanishingly rare exception, class certification sets the litigation\non a path toward res-olution by way of settlement, not full-fledged\ntesting of the plaintiffs\u2019 case by trial\u201d); see also v.\n, (\u201c[E]xtensive discovery andthe potential for uncertainty\nand disruption in a lawsuit allow plaintiffs with weak claims to\nextort settlements from innocent companies\u201d).8Of course, today\u2019s\ndecision makes clear that a defendant may rebut the presumption by\nproducing evidence that the misstatement at issue failed to affect\nthe market price of the security, see at 17\u201322. But both\nparts of \u2019s version of reliance are key to its fiction that\nan investor has \u201cindirectly\u201d relied on the\nmisstatement; the unavailability of rebuttal with respect to one of\nthose parts still functionally removes reliance as an element of\nproof.",
