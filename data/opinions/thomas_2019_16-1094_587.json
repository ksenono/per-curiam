    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u20131094_________________REPUBLIC OF SUDAN, PETITIONERv.RICK\nHARRISON, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[March 26, 2019]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The Court holds that service on a foreign state\nby certified mail under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA)\nis defective unless the packet is \u201caddressed and dispatched to the\nforeign ministerat the minister\u2019s office in the foreign\nstate.\u201dAnte, at 17 (emphasis added). This bright-line\nrule may be attractive from a policy perspective, but the FSIA\nneither specifies nor precludes the use of any particular address.\nInstead, the statute requires only that the packet be sent to a\nparticular person\u2014\u201cthe head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71608(a)(3).Given the unique role that embassies play in\nfacilitating communications between states, a foreign state\u2019s\nembassy in Washington, D. C., is, absent an indication to the\ncontrary, a place where a U.\u00a0S. litigant can serve the state\u2019s\nforeign minister. Because there is no evidence in this case\nsuggesting that Sudan\u2019s Embassy declined the service packet\naddressed to its foreign minister\u2014as it was free to do\u2014I would hold\nthat respondents complied with the FSIA when they addressed and\ndispatched a service packet to Sudan\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs\nat Sudan\u2019s Embassy in Washington, D. C. Accordingly, I respectfully\ndissent.ITo serve a foreign state by certified mail\nunder the FSIA, the service packet must be \u201caddressed and\ndispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of\nforeign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\u201dIbid. In\nmany respects, I approach this statutory text in the same way as\nthe Court. I have no quarrel with the major- ity\u2019s definitions of\nthe relevant statutory terms,ante,at 6\u20137, and I agree that\nthe FSIA does not deem a foreign state properly served solely\nbecause the service method is reasonably calculated to provide\nactual notice,ante,at 9\u201310, 15\u201316. Nor does the FSIA\nauthorize service on a foreign state by utilizing an agent\ndesignated to receive process for the state.Ante,at 10\u201311.\nAt the same time, the FSIA stops short of requiring that the\nforeign minister person- ally receive or sign for the service\npacket: As long as the service packet is \u201caddressed and dispatched\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to\u201d the foreign minister, \u00a71608(a)(3), the\nminister\u2019s subordinates may accept the packet and act appropriately\non his behalf.Ante,at 8.In short, I agree with the majority that\n\u00a71608(a)(3) requires that the service packet be dispatched to an\naddress for the foreign minister. The relevant question, in my\nview, is whether a foreign state\u2019s embassy in the United States can\nserve as a place where the minister of for- eign affairs may be\nreached by mail. Unlike the majority, I conclude that it can.IIA foreign state\u2019s embassy in Washington,\nD.\u00a0C., is generally a place where a U.\u00a0S. court can\ncommunicate by mail with the state\u2019s foreign minister. Unless an\nembassy decides to decline packages containing judicial\nsummonses\u2014as it is free to do, both in individual cases or as a\nbroader policy\u2014a service packet addressed and dispatched to a\nforeign minister at the address of its embassy in the United States\nsatisfies \u00a71608(a)(3).Because embassies are \u201cresponsible for\nstate-to-state relationships,\u201d Malone, The Modern Diplomatic\nMission, in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy 124 (A. Cooper,\nJ. Heine, & R. Thakur eds. 2013), an important function of an\nembassy or other \u201cdiplomatic mission\u201d is to \u201cact as a permanent\nchannel of communication between the sending state and the\nreceiving state.\u201d G. Berridge & A. James, A Dictionary of\nDiplomacy 73 (2d ed. 2003). Embassies fulfill this function in\nnumerous ways, including by using secure faxes, e-mails, or the\n\u201cdiplomatic bag\u201d to transmit documents to the states they\nrepresent. A. Aust, Handbook of International Law 122 (2d ed.\n2010); seeibid.(the diplomatic bag is a mailbag or freight\ncontainer containing diplomatic documents or articles intended for\nofficial use). Thus, as oneamicusbrief aptly puts it,\nembassies \u201chave direct lines of communications with the home\ncountry, and a pipeline to route communications to the proper\noffices and officials.\u201d Brief for Former U.\u00a0S.\nCounterterrorism Officials et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae29.Numerous provisions of the Vienna Convention on\nDiplomatic Relations (VCDR) confirm this reality, Apr. 18, 1961, 23\nU. S. T. 3227, T. I. A. S. No. 7502. Under the VCDR, an embassy\n\u201cmay employ all appropriate means\u201d of communicating with the state\nwhose interests it represents, Art. 27(1), including \u201cmodern means\nof communication such as (mobile) telecommunication, fax, and\nemail,\u201d Wouters, Duquet, & Meuwissen, The Vienna Conventions on\nDiplomatic and Consular Relations, in The Oxford Handbook of Modern\nDiplomacy,supra, at 523. The VCDR provides substantial\nprotections for the \u201cofficial correspondence of the mission\u201d and\nthe diplomatic bag, which may include \u201cdiplomatic documents or\narticles intended for official use.\u201d Arts. 27(1)\u2013(5); cf. Vienna\nConvention on Consular Relations, Arts. 3, 5(j), 35, Apr. 24, 1963,\n21 U. S. T. 77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820 (recognizing that embassies\nmay perform \u201c[c]onsular functions,\u201d such as \u201ctransmitting judicial\nand extrajudicial documents,\u201d and affording protections to official\ncommunications).The capability of an embassy to route service\npapers to the sending state is confirmed by the State Department\nregulation implementing \u00a71608(a)(4), which provides for service on\nthe foreign state through diplomatic channels. Under this\nregulation, the Department may deliver the service packet \u201cto the\nembassy of the foreign state in the District of Columbia\u201d \u201c[i]f the\nforeign state so requests or if otherwise appropriate.\u201d 22 CFR\n\u00a793.1(c)(2) (2018). Al- though the service packet under \u00a71608(a)(4)\nneed not be addressed and dispatched to the foreign minister, the\nregulation implementing it nevertheless demonstrates that embassies\ndo in fact provide a channel of communication between the United\nStates and foreign countries.It was against this backdrop that respondents\nrequested that their service packet be \u201caddressed and dispatched by\nthe clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign\naffairs of [Sudan],\u201d \u00a71608(a)(3), at the address of its embassy in\nWashington, D.\u00a0C. Because an embassy serves as a channel\nthrough which the U.\u00a0S. Government can communicate with the\nsending state\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, this method of service\ncomplied with the ordinary meaning of \u00a71608(a)(3) on this record.\nThere is\u2014and this is critical\u2014no evidence in the record showing\nthat Sudan\u2019s foreign minister could not be reached through the em-\nbassy. As the majority acknowledges, the clerk received a signed\nreturn receipt and a shipping confirmation stating that the package\nhad been delivered.Ante,at 3. Nothing on the receipt or\nconfirmation indicated that the package could not be delivered to\nits addressee, and both the clerk and the District Judge determined\nthat service had been properly effectuated.Of course, the FSIA does not impose a\nsubstantive obligation on the embassy to accept or transmit service\nof process directed to the attention of the foreign minister. A\nforeign state and its embassy are free to reject some or all\npackets addressed to the attention of the foreign minister. But, as\ndetailed above, Sudan has pointed to nothing in the record\nsuggesting that its embassy refused service, or that its embassy\naddress was not a place at which its foreign minister could be\nreached. On these facts, I would hold that the service packet was\nproperly \u201caddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the\nhead of the ministry of foreign affairs.\u201d \u00a71608(a)(3).IIIAInstead of focusing on whether service at an\nembassy satisfies the FSIA, the Court articulates a bright-line\nrule: To comply with \u00a71608(a)(3), \u201c[a] service packet must be\naddressed and dispatched to the foreign ministerat the\nminister\u2019s office in the foreign state.\u201dAnte,at 17\n(emphasis added). Whatever virtues this rule possesses, the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation is not the \u201cmost natural reading\u201d of \u00a71608(a)(3),ante,at 6.The Court focuses on the foreign minister\u2019s\n\u201ccustomary office\u201d or \u201cplace of work,\u201dante,at 9, 7, but\nthese terms appear nowhere in \u00a71608. The FSIA requires that the\nservice packet be \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d to a particularperson\u2014\u201cthe head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\u201d\n\u00a71608(a)(3). It does not further require that the package be\naddressed and dispatched to any particularplace. While I\nagree with the Court that sending the service packet to the foreign\nministry is one way to satisfy \u00a71608(a)(3), that is different from\nsaying that \u00a71608(a)(3) requires service exclusively at that\nlocation.The absence of a textual foundation for the\nmajority\u2019s rule is only accentuated when \u00a71608(a)(3) is compared to\n\u00a71608(a)(4), the adjacent paragraph governing service through\ndiplomatic channels. Under that provision, the service packet must\nbe \u201caddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the\nSecretary of Statein Washington, District of Columbia, to\nthe attention of the Director of Special Consular Services.\u201d\n\u00a71608(a)(4) (emphasis added); see 22 CFR \u00a793.1(c) (State Department\nregulation governing service under this provision). Unlike\n\u00a71608(a)(3), this provision specifies both the person to be servedandthe location of service. While not dispositive, the\nabsence of a similar limitation in \u00a71608(a)(3) undermines the\ncategorical rule adopted by the Court.The Court offers three additional arguments in\nsupport of its position, but none justifies its bright-line\nrule.First, the Court offers a series of\nhypotheticals to suggest that the term \u201cdispatched\u201d not only\ncontemplates a prompt shipment, but also connotes sending the\nletter directly to a place where the person is likely to be\nphysically located.Ante,at 7\u20138. In my opinion, these\nhypotheticals are inapt. The unique role of an embassy in\nfacilitating communications between sovereign governments does not\nhave an analog in the hypotheticals offered by the\nmajority.[1] And to the extent\nthe statute emphasizes speed and directness, as the majority\nsuggests, dispatching a letter to a Washington-based embassy with a\ndirect line of communication to the foreign minister\u2014including the\nability to communicate electronically\u2014seems at least as efficient\nas dispatching the letter across the globe to a foreign country,\nparticularly if that country has recently experienced armed\nconflict or political instability.Second, the Court notes that, under its rule,\nthe effective date of service under \u00a71608(c) will be closer in time\nto when the service packet reaches a foreign official who knows how\nto respond to the summons.Ante, at 11\u201312. That contention\nassumes embassy employees are less capable of responding to a\nsummons than foreign-ministry employees. But even granting that\npremise, this argument falls short. An embassy is capable of\nquickly transmitting a summons to the foreign minister, whether\nelectronically, by diplomatic bag, or by some other means. Any time\nlost in transmission is not significant enough to warrant the\nCourt\u2019s departure from the text of the statute.Third, the Court argues that allowing service at\nthe embassy would make it easier to serve a foreign state than it\nis to serve a person in that foreign state under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 4.Ante,at 13\u201314. I am not persuaded. Under\nthe FSIA, service by mail is not effective until \u201cthe date of\nreceipt indicated in the .\u00a0.\u00a0. signed and returned postal\nreceipt.\u201d \u00a71608(c)(2). That is no more generous than practice under\nRule 4, especially since the foreign minister need not accept\nservice. To the extent that embassies accept service of process\ndirected to the foreign minister, it is that decision that eases\nthe burden on the plaintiff, not \u00a71608(a)(3).BSudan also argues that allowing service by\nmail at an embassy would violate Article 22(1) of the VCDR. The\nCourt does not adopt Sudan\u2019s argument, stating only that its\ndecision has \u201cthe virtue of avoiding potential tension\u201d with the\nVCDR.Ante,at 13. But there is no tension between my\nreading of the FSIA and the VCDR.[2]Article 22(1) of the VCDR provides that the\npremises of the mission\u2014that is, \u201cthe buildings or parts of\nbuildings and the land ancillary thereto .\u00a0.\u00a0. used for\nthe purposes of the mission,\u201d Art. 1(i)\u2014\u201cshall be inviolable.\u201d The\nVCDR consistently uses the word \u201cinviolable\u201d to protect against\nphysical intrusions and similar types of interference, not the\njurisdiction of a court. The concept of \u201cinviolability\u201d is used,\nfor instance, to protect the mission\u2019s \u201cpremises,\u201d Art.\u00a022(1);\nthe \u201carchives and documents of the mission,\u201d Art. 24; the \u201cofficial\ncorrespondence of the mission,\u201d Art. 27(2); the \u201cprivate residence\nof a diplomatic agent,\u201d Art. 30(1); and the diplomatic agent\u2019s\n\u201cperson,\u201d \u201cpapers, correspondence, and,\u201d with certain exceptions,\n\u201chis property,\u201d Arts. 29, 30(2).The provisions of the VCDR that protect against\nassertions of jurisdiction, by contrast, speak in terms of\n\u201cimmunity.\u201d Thus, in addition to physical inviolability, the\npremises of the mission (and \u201cother property thereon\u201d) are\nseparately \u201cimmune from search, requisition, attachment or\nexecution.\u201d Art. 22(3). And a diplomatic agent is separately\n\u201cimmun[e] from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State\u201d\nand, generally, from \u201cits civil and administrative jurisdiction.\u201d\nArt. 31(1). Several provisions of the VCDR distinguish between\n\u201cimmunity from jurisdiction, and inviolability.\u201d Art. 38(1); see\nArts. 31(1), (3).Given the VCDR\u2019s consistent use of\n\u201cinviolability\u201d to protect against physical intrusions and\ninterference, and \u201cimmunity\u201d to protect against judicial authority,\nArticle 22(1)\u2019s protection of the mission premises is best\nunderstood as a protection against the former. Thus, under the\nVCDR, the inviolability of the embassy\u2019s premises is not implicated\nby receipt of service papers to any greater degree than it is by\nreceipt of other mail. Cf.Reyesv.Al-Malki, [2017]\nUKSC 61, \u00b616 (holding that service via mail at the diplomatic\nresidence\u2014which is afforded the same level of protection as the\nmission premises under Article 30(1)\u2014does not violate the\nVCDR).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the method of service employed by\nrespondents here complied with the FSIA, I would affirm the\njudgment of the Second Circuit.Notes1To the extent the\nrelationship between a U.\u00a0S. Attorney\u2019s office and the\nAttorney General is analogous, the majority correctly acknowledges\nthat the office would \u201cvery probably forward\u201d a letter directed to\nthe attention of the Attorney General.Ante, at 8. The\nmajority nevertheless believes that it would be improper or unusual\nto dispatch that letter to a local U.\u00a0S. Attorney\u2019s office. I\ndisagree. It seems entirely likely that a person residing in the\nDistrict of Idaho would dispatch a letter to the Attorney General\nthrough the U.\u00a0S. Attorney\u2019s office serving his District\u2014even\nif it would be odd for a resident of the District of Columbia to\nuse that Idaho address.2Even if there were, the\nFSIA postdates the VCDR and thus \u201c\u00a0\u2018renders the treaty\nnull\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018to the extent of conflict.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBreardv.Greene,523 U.S.\n371, 376 (1998) (per curiam) (quotingReidv.Covert,354 U.S.\n1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion)).",
