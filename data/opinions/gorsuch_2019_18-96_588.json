THOMAS, EXECUTIVE\nDIRECTOR OF THE TENNESSEE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE COMMISSION,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 26, 2019]Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas\njoins, dissenting.Alcohol occupies a complicated place in this\ncountry\u2019s history. Some of the founders were enthusiasts; Benjamin\nFranklin thought wine was \u201cproof that God loves us.\u201d Letter from B.\nFranklin to A. Morellet (July 1779), in 7 Writings of Benjamin\nFranklin 437 (A. Smyth ed. 1907). Many in the Prohibition era were\ndecidedly less enamored; they saw \u201cliquor [a]s a lawlessness unto\nitself.\u201dDuckworthv.Arkansas,314 U.S.\n390, 398 (1941) (Jackson, J., concurring in result). Over time,\nthe people have adopted two separate constitutional Amendments to\nadjust and then readjust alcohol\u2019s role in our society. But through\nit all, one thing has always held true: States may impose residency\nrequirements on those who seek to sell alcohol within their borders\nto ensure that retailers comply with local laws and norms. In fact,\nStates have enacted residency requirements for at least 150 years,\nand the Tennessee law at issue before us has stood since 1939.\nToday and for the first time, the Court claims to have discovered a\nduty and power to strike down laws like these as unconstitutional.\nRespectfully, I do not see it.Start with the text of the Constitution. After\nthe Nation\u2019s failed experiment with Prohibition, the people\nassembled in conventions in each State to adopt the Twenty-first\nAmendment. In \u00a71, they repealed the Eighteenth Amendment\u2019s\nnationwide prohibition on the sale of alcohol. But in \u00a72, they\nprovided that \u201c[t]he transportation or importation into any State\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. for delivery or use therein of intoxicating\nliquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\u201d\nThe Amendment thus embodied a classically federal compromise:\nNationwide prohibition ended, but States gained broad discretion to\ncalibrate alcohol regulations to local preferences. And under the\nterms of this compromise, Tennessee\u2019s law imposing a two-year\nresidency requirement on those who seek to sell liquor within its\njurisdiction would seem perfectly permissible.[1]Of course, \u00a72 does not immunize state laws fromallconstitutional claims. Everyone agrees that state laws\nmust still comply with, say, the First Amendment or the Equal\nProtection Clause.Ante, at 11\u201312. But the challenge before\nus isn\u2019t based on any constitutional provision like that. Instead,\nwe are asked to decide whether Tennessee\u2019s residency requirement\nimpermissibly discriminates against out-of-state residents and\nrecent arrivals in violation of the \u201cdormant Commerce Clause\u201d\ndoctrine. And that doctrine is a peculiar one. Unlike most\nconstitutional rights, the dormant Commerce Clause doctrinecannot be found in the text of any\nconstitutional provision but is (at best) an implication from one.\nUnder its banner, this Court has sometimes asserted the power to\nstrike down state laws that discriminate against nonresidents on\nthe ground that they usurp the authority to regulate interstate\ncommerce that the Constitution assigns in Article I to Congress.\nBut precisely because the Constitution assignsCongressthe\npower to regulate interstate commerce, that body is free to rebut\nany implication of unconstitutionality that might otherwise arise\nunder the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by authorizing States to\nadopt laws favoring in-state residents.Prudential Ins. Co.v.Benjamin,328 U.S.\n408, 434\u2013436 (1946).And that\u2019s exactly what happened here. In the\nWebb-Kenyon Act of 1913, Congress gave the States wide latitude to\nrestrict the sale of alcohol within their borders. See 37Stat. 699\n(codified at 27 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7122). Not only is that law\nstill on the books today, \u00a72 of the Twenty-first Amendment closely\n\u201cfollowed the wording of the 1913 Webb-Kenyon Act.\u201dAnte, at\n11, n.\u00a05. Accordingly, the people who adopted the Amendment\nnaturally would have understood it to constitutionalize an\n\u201cexception to the normal operation of the [dormant] Commerce\nClause.\u201dCraigv.Boren,429\nU.S. 190, 206 (1976). After all, what Congress can do by\nstatute \u201csurely the people may do .\u00a0.\u00a0. through the\nprocess of amending our Constitution.\u201dGranholmv.Heald,544 U.S.\n460, 494 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting). So in this area, at\nleast, we should not be in the business of imposing our own\njudge-made \u201cdormant Commerce Clause\u201d limitations on state\npowers.What the relevant constitutional and statutory\ntexts suggest, history confirms. Licensing requirements for the\nsale of liquor are older than the Nation itself. Byse, Alcoholic\nBeverage Control Before Repeal, 7 Law & Contemp. Prob. 544,\n544\u2013547 (1940). Colonial authorities generally allowed sales only\nby those who were deemed \u201c\u00a0\u2018fit and suitable\u2019\u00a0\u201d and who\nagreed to post a bond conditioned upon compliance with local\nregulations.Id., at 545. States started adopting residency\nrequirements as early as 1834, when New Hampshire began requiring\nany person who sold liquor \u201cin any quantity less than one gallon\u201d\nto obtain a license \u201cfrom the selectmen of the town or place where\nsuch person resides.\u201dStatev.Adams, 6 N.\u00a0H.\n532, 533 (1834). In 1845, Missouri adopted a law nearly identical\nto the Tennessee statute now before us, requiring those seeking to\nsell liquor to have resided in the State for two years. Mo. Rev.\nStat. app., p.\u00a01099. In the decades that followed, several\nother States and Territories followed suit and enacted laws like\nTennessee\u2019s.[2]At the time these residency requirements were\nadopted they were widely understood to be constitutional, and\ncourts generally upheld them against legal challenges. H. Black,\nLaws Regulating the Manufacture and Sale of Intoxicating Liquors\n\u00a730, pp.\u00a039\u201340, and n.\u00a033 (1892) (collecting cases).\nIndeed, in the mid-19th century this Court \u201crecognized a broad\nauthority in state governments to regulate the trade of alcoholic\nbeverages within their borders free from implied restrictions under\nthe Commerce Clause.\u201dCraig, 429 U.\u00a0S., at 205 (citing\ntheLicense Cases, 5 How. 504, 579 (1847)).Things became more contentious only toward the\nend of the 19th century. By then, this Court had begun to take a\nmore muscular approach to the dormant Commerce Clause and started\nusing that implied doctrine to strike down state laws that\nrestricted the sale of imported liquor. SeeBowmanv.Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U.\u00a0S.465 (1888);Leisyv.Hardin,135 U.S.\n100(1890). But this judicial activism did not go unnoticed,\nand in 1890 Congress responded by passing the Wilson Act. Ch. 728,\n26Stat. 313 (codified at 27 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7121). That law\nsought to bolster the authority of States to regulate the\ndistribution of liquor within their borders by providing that\nliquor shipped into a State would \u201cupon arrival in such State\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be subject to the operation and effect of the laws\nof such State .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the same extent and in the same\nmanner as though such [liquor] had been produced in such\nState.\u201dStill, the Court did not seem to get the\nmessage. A second wave of dormant Commerce Clause attacks on state\nlaws soon followed, and in the process they highlighted some of the\nWilson Act\u2019s limitations. InScottv.Donald,165 U.S.\n58(1897), the Court addressed South Carolina\u2019s state monopoly\nsystem for the sale of liquor, which required state agents to favor\ndomestic products and prohibited consumers from receiving\nout-of-state shipments for personal use. The Court held that this\nsystem unconstitutionally discriminated in favor of domestic\nproducts \u201cas against similar products of the other States.\u201dId., at 101. Citing the text of the Wilson Act, including\nthe phrase \u201cto the same extent and in the same manner,\u201d the Court\nemphasized that the Act did not go so far as to authorize States to\n\u201cdiscriminate injuriously against products of other States.\u201dId., at 100. Then, inRhodesv.Iowa,170 U.S.\n412(1898), the Court further curbed the States\u2019 authority to\nrestrict liquor distribution by construing the Wilson Act\u2019s phrase\n\u201cupon arrival in such State\u201d to mean arrival at the purchaser\u2019s\naddress, rather than arrival within the State\u2019s borders.Id., at 421, 426; see alsoVancev.W. A.VandercookCo.,170 U.S.\n438(1898).Once more, however, Congress stepped in to\nrepudiate this Court\u2019s decisions, this time in unmistakably\nsweeping language. In the Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913, Congress went so\nfar as to \u201c[take] the protection of interstate commerceaway\u201d from the distribution of liquor within a State\u2019s\nborders.Clark Distilling Co.v.Western Maryland\nR.\u00a0Co.,242 U.S.\n311, 325 (1917) (emphasis added). The language Congress used\ncould not have been plainer: The Act \u201cprohibited\u201d any \u201cshipment or\ntransportation\u201d of alcoholic beverages \u201cinto any State\u201d when they\nare \u201cintended, by any person interested therein, to be received,\npossessed, sold, or in any manner used .\u00a0.\u00a0. in violation\nof any law of such State.\u201d 27 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7122. Within a few\nyears, the Court conceded the Webb-Kenyon Act\u2019s constitutionality,\nacknowledging along the way that the law was designed to\u2014and\ndid\u2014\u201cprevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce\nfrom being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such\ncommerce in States contrary to their laws.\u201dClark\nDistilling, 242 U.\u00a0S., at 324.[3]This history bears special relevance because\neveryone agrees that, whatever other powers \u00a72 grants the States,\nat a minimum it \u201c\u00a0\u2018constitutionaliz[ed]\u2019\u00a0\u201d the similarly\nworded Webb-Kenyon Act.Ante, at 11, n.\u00a05, 21. Nor can\nthere be much doubt how most everyone understood the terms of the\nAct and the Amendment that embodied it. Because \u201ccentralized\nregulation did not work,\u201d the Twenty-first Amendment both ended\nnationwide prohibition in \u00a71 and authorized local control in \u00a72.\nYablon, The Prohibition Hangover: Why We Are Still Feeling the\nEffects of Prohibition, 13 Va. J. Soc. Pol\u2019y & L. 552, 584\n(2006). As a leading study noted at the time, \u201cit was a mistake to\nregard the United States as a single community in which a uniform\npolicy of liquor control could be enforced.\u201d R. Fosdick & A.\nScott, Toward Liquor Control 10 (1933) (Fosdick & Scott). Ours\nis a vast and diverse Nation, and those who adopted the Amendment\nbelieved that what works for one State may not work for another.\nConsistent with this widespread public understanding of the\nAmendment\u2019s terms, at least 18 States adopted residency\nrequirements for retailers within the first 15 years after its\nratification.[4]This Court\u2019s initial cases also reflected the\nsame understanding of the Amendment\u2019s effect. Just a few years\nafter ratification, a unanimous Court upheld discriminatory state\nliquor laws against a dormant Commerce Clause attack, explaining\nthat \u201cto construe the Amendment as saying, in effect: [the State]\nmust let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. would involve not a construction of the Amendment,\nbut a rewrit-ing of it.\u201dState Bd. of Equalization of\nCal.v.Young\u2019s Market Co.,299 U.S.\n59, 62 (1936). Other early cases reached similar conclusions.\nSee,e.g.,Mahoneyv.Joseph Triner Corp.,304 U.S.\n401, 403 (1938) (\u201c[D]iscrimination against imported liquor is\npermissible\u201d);Indianapolis Brewing Co.v.Liquor Control\nComm\u2019n,305 U.S.\n391, 394 (1939) (\u201cWhether the Michigan law should not more\nproperly be described as a protective measure, we have no occasion\nto consider,\u201d for \u201cwhatever its character, the law is valid\u201d). In\nshort, this Court \u201crecognized from the start\u201d that the Twenty-first\nAmendment allowed the States to regulate alcohol \u201c\u00a0\u2018unfettered\nby the Commerce Clause.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGranholm, 544 U.\u00a0S., at\n517 (Thomas, J., dissenting).[5]Straying from the text, state practice, and\nearly precedent, and leaning instead on the Amendment\u2019s famously\nsparse legislative history, the Court says it can find no evidence\nthat \u00a72 wasintendedto authorize \u201cprotectionist\u201d state\nlaws.Ante, at 21, 22 n.\u00a015. But even there plenty of\nevidence can be found that those who ratified the Amendment wanted\nthe States to be able to regulate the sale of liquor free of\njudicial meddling under the dormant Commerce Clause\u2014and there is no\nevidence they wanted judges to have the power to decide that state\nlaws restrictedcompetition \u201ctoo much.\u201d[6] After all, both before Prohibi- tion and after\nrepeal, robust competition in the liquor industry was far from\nuniversally considered an unalloyed good; lower prices enabled\nhigher consumption and invited social problems along the way. T.\nPegram, Battling Demon Rum 94\u201396 (1998); Fosdick & Scott 43\u201344,\n81. The point of \u00a72 was to allow each State the opportunity to\nassess for itself the costs and benefits of free trade in alcohol.\nReduced competition and increased prices were foreseeable\nconsequences of allowing such unfettered state regulation, but they\nwere consequences the people willingly accepted with the compromise\nof the Twenty-first Amendment.[7]That leaves only our modern precedent to\nconsider\u2014and even here the initial returns support Tennessee. InHostetterv.Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp.,377 U.S.\n324(1964), for example, this Court addressed a New York law\nthat interfered with the federally regulated sale of alcohol to\npassengers departing from an airport, which the passengers would\nnot receive until they arrived at their \u201cforeign destination.\u201dId., at 325. Emphasizing that \u201cultimate delivery and use\u201d\nwas \u201cin a foreign country,\u201d this Court held that the Twenty-first\nAmendment did not permit New York to \u201cprevent transactions carried\non under the aegis of a law passed by Congress in the exercise of\nits explicit power under the Constitution to regulate commerce with\nforeign nations.\u201dId., at 333\u2013334. But at the same time, the\nCourt took pains to reassure everyone that the States\u2019 core\nauthority to \u201crestrict, regulate, or prevent the traffic and\ndistribution of intoxicants within [their] borders\u201d remained\n\u201cunquestioned\u201d and \u201cunconfined\u201d by the dormant Commerce Clause.Id., at 330; see alsoCapital Cities Cable,Inc.v.Crisp,467 U.S.\n691, 713 (1984) (describing \u201cthe core \u00a72 power\u201d as a State\u2019s\nauthority \u201cdirectly to regulate the sale or use of liquor within\nits borders\u201d).Consistent with that understanding, this Court\ninHeublein,Inc.v.South Carolina Tax\nComm\u2019n,409 U.S.\n275(1972), unanimously upheld a South Carolina law permitting\nproducers to transfer liquor to in-state wholesalers only through\n\u201cresident representative[s].\u201dId., at 277. Because the\nrequirement was an \u201cappropriate element inthe State\u2019s system\u201d of regulating the sale of\nalcohol \u201c\u00a0\u2018within its borders,\u2019\u00a0\u201d this Court held that\nthe State could enforce it \u201c\u00a0\u2018unconfined by traditional\nCommerce Clause limitations.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 283 (quotingHotstetter, 377 U.\u00a0S., at 330). To be sure, in even\nlater cases the Court declined to uphold state laws that, in\nsubstantial effect, regulated the sale of alcohol inotherstates.E.g.,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.v.New\nYork State Liquor Authority,476 U.S.\n573(1986);Healyv.Beer Institute,491 U.S.\n324(1989). But those decisions merely tracked the text of the\nTwenty-first Amendment, which grants States the power to regulate\nliquor only \u201cfor delivery or usetherein.\u201dThe truth is, things have begun to shift only in\nvery recent years. Bending to the same impulses that moved it at\nthe beginning of the 20th century, this Court has lately begun\nflexing its dormant Commerce Clause muscles once more to strike\ndown state laws even in core areas of state authority under \u00a72. So,\nfor example, inBacchus Imports,Ltd.v.Dias,468 U.S.\n263(1984), the Court considered Hawaii\u2019s tax exemption for\ncertain liquor products manufactured in-state. As the Court\ndescribed it, Hawaii\u2019s sole \u201cpurpose\u201d in adopting its tax exemption\nwas \u201c\u00a0\u2018to promote a local industry,\u2019\u00a0\u201d not \u201cto promote\ntemperance.\u201dId., at 276. And a narrow majority considered\nthis fact fatal because the law, in its judgment, did not implicate\n\u201cany clear concern\u201d of the Amendment\u2014even though the Amendment was\nadopted to insulate state regulation from judicial charges of\nunduly interfering with interstate commerce.Ibid.Yet, even under as bold a decision asBacchus, Tennessee\u2019s residency requirement should\nsurvive\u2014and easily. A residency requirement may not be the only way\nto ensure retailers will be amenable to state regulatory oversight,\nbut it is surely one reasonable way of accomplishing that\nadmittedly legitimate goal.[8]\nResidency also increases the odds that retailers will have a stake\nin the communities they serve.[9] As Judge Sutton observed in the proceedings below, this\nsame commonsense rationale may explain why Congress requires\nfederal court of appeals judges to live within their circuits, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a744(c), and district court judges to live within\ntheir districts, \u00a7134(b).Byrdv.Tennessee Wine and\nSpirits Retailers Assn., 883 F.3d 608, 633 (2018). Surely,\nTennessee cannot be faulted for sharing a similar view. Of course,\nTennessee\u2019s residency requirement reduces competition in the liquor\nmarket by excluding nonresidents or recent arrivals. But even that\neffect might serve a legitimate state purpose by increasing the\nprice of alcohol and thus moderating its use, an objective States\nhave always remained free to pursue under the bargain of the\nTwenty-first Amendment.[10]To defend its judgment today, the Court is thus\nleft to try to wring support from our 2005 decision inGranholm.GranholmextendedBacchusand its\nreasoning to strike down on dormant Commerce Clause grounds a state\nlaw for disfavoring out-of-state wine producers, holding that\u201cSection 2 does not allow States to regulate the\ndirect shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of\nin-stateproducers.\u201d 544 U.\u00a0S., at 476 (emphasis\nadded). But even this holding doesn\u2019t spell doom for Tennessee\u2019s\nretailer residency requirements. As even the Court today\nacknowledges, \u201cGranholmrepeatedly spoke of discrimination\nagainst out-of-state products and producers\u201d and did not refer more\ngenerally to discrimination against nonresidents.Ante, at\n27.[11]To claimGranholm\u2019s support, the majority\nis thus forced to characterizeGranholm\u2019s framing of the\nissue before it as purely incidental\u2014the state laws at issue there\nhappened to discriminate against out-of-state products, so the\nCourt just happened to talk a lot about products. As the Court\nseems to readGranholm, then, it really meant to disapproveanydiscrimination against out-of-staters. But this badly\nmisreadsGranholm. The distinction between producers and\nother levels of the distribution system was integral to its\nreasoning and result\u2014in fact, it was precisely howGranholmsought to reconcile its result with the longstanding tradition of\nstate residency requirements. So yes,Granholmheld that the\nTwenty-first Amendment does not protect laws that discriminate\nagainst out-of-state products, but italsoexpressly\nreaffirmed the \u201c\u00a0\u2018unquestionabl[e] legitima[cy]\u2019\u00a0\u201d of\nstate laws that require \u201c\u00a0\u2018all liquor sold for use in the\nState [to] be purchased from a licensed in-state\nwholesaler.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 544 U.\u00a0S., at 489 (quotingNorth\nDakotav.United States,495 U.S.\n423, 432 (1990);id., at 447 (Scalia, J., concurring in\njudgment)). And I would have thought that restatement of the law\nmore thanenough to resolve today\u2019s case.Having now effectively abandonedGranholm\u2019s distinction between products and their\ndistribution and promising to subject both to dormant Commerce\nClause scrutiny, it\u2019s hard not to wonder what\u2019s left of Webb-Kenyon\nand \u00a72. For its part, the Court assures us that it will still allow\neach State \u201cleeway to enact the measures thatits citizens\nbelieveare appropriate\u201d to address public health and safety.Ante, at 31 (emphasis added). Yet the Court then proceeds to\nturn around and dismantle the longstanding judgment of the citizens\nof Tennessee on just these questions, dismissing them as\n\u201cprotectionist measures with no demonstrable connection\u201d to public\nhealth and safety.Ibid.And it promises it will not sustain\nany state law whose protectionist \u201ceffect[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\npredomina[te].\u201dAnte, at 32\u201333.What are lower courts supposed to make of this?\nHow much public health and safety benefit must there be to overcome\nthis Court\u2019s worries about protectionism \u201cpredominat[ing]\u201d? Does\nreducing competition in the liquor market, raising prices, and thus\nreducing demand still count as a public health benefit, as many\nStates have long supposed? And if residency requirements are\nproblematic, what about simple physicalpresencelaws? After\nall, can\u2019t States \u201cthoroughly investigate applicants\u201d for liquor\nlicenses without requiring them to have a brick-and-mortar store in\nthe State?Ante, at 34. The Court offers lower courts no\nmore guidance than to proclaim delphically that \u201ceach variation\nmust be judged based on its own features.\u201dAnte, at 28.As judges, we may be sorely tempted to\n\u201crationalize\u201d the law and impose our own free-trade rules for all\ngoods and services in interstate commerce. Certainly, that\ntemptation seems to have proven nearly irresistible for this Court\nwhen it comes to alcohol. And as Justice Cardozo once observed, \u201can\nintellectual passion .\u00a0.\u00a0. for symmetry of form and\nsubstance\u201d is \u201can ideal which can never fail to exert some measure\nof attraction upon the professional experts who make up the lawyer\nclass.\u201d B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 34 (1921).\nBut real life is not always so tidy and satisfactory, and neither\nare the democratic compromises we are bound to respect as judges.\nLike it or not, those who adopted the Twenty-first Amendment took\nthe view that reasonable people can disagree about the costs and\nbenefits of free trade in alcohol. They left us with clear\ninstructions that the free-trade rules this Court has devised for\n\u201ccabbages and candlesticks\u201d should not be applied to alcohol.Carterv.Virginia,321 U.S.\n131, 139 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Under the terms\nof the compromise they hammered out, the regulation of alcohol\nwasn\u2019t left to the imagination of a committee of nine sitting in\nWashington, D.\u00a0C., but to the judgment of the people\nthemselves and their local elected representatives. State\ngovernments were supposed to serve as \u201clab- orator[ies]\u201d of\ndemocracy,New State Ice Co.v.Liebmann,285 U.S.\n262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), with \u201cbroad power\nto regulate liquor under \u00a72,\u201dGranholm, 544 U.\u00a0S., at\n493. If the people wish to alter this arrangement, that is their\nsovereign right. But until then, I would enforce the Twenty-first\nAmendment as they wrote and originally understood it.Notes1The Court suggests that\nTennessee\u2019s residency requirement may fall outside the terms of the\nAmendment because retailers may not be involved in the\n\u201ctransportation or importation\u201d of liquor into the State.Ante, at 26. But the parties do not dispute that\n\u201ctransportation or importation\u201d into the State is involved here.\nAnd understandably so: Unless the liquor stores intend to sell only\nTennessee-made liquor (and no one so alleges), it is hard to see\nhow transportation or importation would not be\ninvolved.2See,e.g., 1859\nNeb.

But these\ncases offer negligible support. True, two cases construed the Act\u2019s\nauthorization of \u201cany laws\u201d as limited to \u201cvalid laws,\u201d a category\nfrom which these courts excluded laws discriminating against the\nproducts of other States. SeeEvansville Brewing Assn.v.Excise Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cty.,Ala., 225 F. 204,\n208 (ND Ala. 1915);Brennenv.Southern Express Co.,\n106 S.\u00a0C. 102, 108\u2013111, 90 S.E. 402, 404 (1916). But there is\nlittle reason to think courts would have considered residency\nrequirements for liquor retailers \u201cinvalid,\u201d as those laws had\ngenerally been upheld prior to Webb-Kenyon. And at least one of the\ncited cases appears to support the opposite view: \u201c[A]ll commands\nor prohibitions ancillary and reasonably related to the state\u2019s\npurpose to promote temperance .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot be thwarted or\nannulled on any idea that constitutional rights are thereby\nviolated.\u201dSouthern Express Co.v.Whittle, 194 Ala.\n406, 436, 69 So. 652, 661 (1915). At any rate, a few scattered,\nthinly reasoned state and district court cases hardly settle\nanything.4Granholmv.Heald,544 U.S.\n460, 518, and n.\u00a06 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n(collecting state statutes); Brief for Petitioner 33\u201334 (same). See\nalso Note, Economic Localism in State Alcoholic Beverage\nLaws\u2014Experience Under the Twenty-first Amendment, 72 Harv. L. Rev.\n1145, 1148\u20131149, and n.\u00a025 (1959). At least 10 States,\nincluding Tennessee, required a fixed period of residency of one\nyear or more. Brief for Petitioner 34 (collecting\nstatutes).5The Court discounts the\ncompelling evidence of postratification practice because, it\nsuggests, States may have been relying on the Court\u2019s expansive\ninterpretation of \u00a72 inState Bd. of Education of Cal.v.Young\u2019s Market,299 U.S.\n59(1936), rather than their own independent understanding of\nthe Amendment.Ante, at 29. But most of the residency\nrequirements were enactedbeforethat November 1936\ndecision. Although many of the statutes werecodifiedafterYoung\u2019s Market, a large majority wereenactedearlier.

But under parts of\nthe Constitution that \u00a72 left intact, such as the Equal Protection\nand Due Process clauses, any state law must bear a rational\nrelationship to a legitimate state interest. Besides and\nunderstandably, the evidence before us suggests that the people who\nratified \u00a72 weren\u2019t as concerned with States adopting fanciful laws\nlike the majority\u2019s as they were with eliminating a very real\nthreat\u2014that judges would continue to use the dormant Commerce\nClause to meddle with state regulatory authority.8SeeSouthernWine& Spirits of Am.,Inc. v.Division\nof Alcohol and Tobacco Control, 731 F.3d 799, 811 (CA8 2013)\n(Colloton, J.);Hinebaughv.James, 119 W.
