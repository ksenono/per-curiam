SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONERv.JAMES GARCIA DIMAYAon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[April 17, 2018]Justice Kagan announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts\nI, III, IV\u2013B, and V, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and\nIV\u2013A, in which Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice\nSotomayor join.Three Terms ago, inJohnsonv.United\nStates, this Court held that part of a federal law\u2019s definition\nof \u201cviolent felony\u201d was impermissibly vague. See 576 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015). The question in this case is whether a similarly worded\nclause in a statute\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d suffers\nfrom the same constitutional defect. Adhering to our analysis inJohnson, we hold that it does.IThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\nrenders deportable any alien convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nafter entering the United States. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Such an alien is also ineligible for\ncancellation of removal, a form of discretionary relief allowing\nsome deportable aliens to remain in the country. See \u00a7\u00a71229b(a)(3),\n(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, removal is a virtual certainty for an alien\nfound to have an aggravated felony conviction, no matter how long\nhe has previously resided here.The INA defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d by listing\nnumerous offenses and types of offenses, often with\ncross-references to federal criminal statutes. \u00a71101(a)(43); seeLuna Torresv.Lynch, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 2). According to one item on that long list, an\naggravated felony includes \u201ca crime of violence (as defined in\nsection 16 of title 18 .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0) for which the term of\nimprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(F). The\nspecified statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716, provides the federal\ncriminal code\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Its two parts,\noften known as the elements clause and the residual clause,\ncover:\u201c(a)\u2002an offense that has as an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson or property of another, or\u201c(b)\u2002any other offense that is a felony and\nthat, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical\nforce against the person or property of another may be used in the\ncourse of committing the offense.\u201dSection 16(b), the residual clause, is the part\nof the statute at issue in this case.To decide whether a person\u2019s conviction \u201cfalls\nwithin the ambit\u201d of that clause, courts use a distinctive form of\nwhat we have called the categorical approach.Leocalv.Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7 (2004) . The question, we have\nexplained, is not whether \u201cthe particular facts\u201d underlying a\nconviction posed the substantial risk that \u00a716(b) demands.Ibid.Neither is the question whether the statutory elements\nof a crime require (or entail) the creation of such a risk in each\ncase that the crime covers.[1]\nThe \u00a716(b) inquiry instead turns on the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d\ngener- ally speaking.Ibid.(referring to \u00a716(b)\u2019s \u201cby its\nnature\u201d language). More precisely, \u00a716(b) requires a court to ask\nwhether \u201cthe ordinary case\u201d of an offense poses the requisite risk.Jamesv.United States, 550 U.\u00a0S. 192, 208\n(2007) ; seeinfra, at 7.In the case before us, Immigration Judges\nemployed that analysis to conclude that respondent James Dimaya is\ndeportable as an aggravated felon. A native of the Philippines,\nDimaya has resided lawfully in the United States since 1992. But he\nhas not always acted lawfully during that time. Twice, Dimaya was\nconvicted of first-degree burglary under California law. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7459, 460(a). Following his second offense, the\nGovernment initiated a removal proceeding against him. Both an\nImmigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals held that\nCalifornia first-degree burglary is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under\n\u00a716(b). \u201c[B]y its nature,\u201d the Board reasoned, the offense \u201ccarries\na substantial risk of the use of force.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n46a. Dimaya sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit.While his appeal was pending, this Court held\nunconstitutional part of the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e).\nACCA prescribes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if a person\nconvicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm has three\nprior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). The\ndefinition of that statutory term goes as follows:\u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a\nterm exceeding one year .\u00a0.\u00a0. that\u2014\u201c(i)\u2002has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of another;\nor\u201c(ii)\u2002is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves\nuse of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).The italicized portion of that definition (like\nthe similar language of \u00a716(b)) came to be known as the statute\u2019s\nresidual clause. InJohnsonv.United States, the\nCourt declared that clause \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d under the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 13\u201314).Relying onJohnson, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that \u00a716(b), as incorporated into the INA, was also\nunconstitutionally vague, and accordingly ruled in Dimaya\u2019s favor.\nSeeDimayav.Lynch, 803 F.\u00a03d 1110, 1120\n(2015). Two other Circuits reached the same conclusion, but a third\ndistinguished ACCA\u2019s residual clause from \u00a716\u2019s.[2] We granted certiorari to resolve the\nconflict.Lynchv.Dimaya, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2016).II\u201cThe prohibition of vagueness in criminal\nstatutes,\u201d our decision inJohnsonexplained, is an\n\u201cessential\u201d of due process, required by both \u201cordinary notions of\nfair play and the settled rules of law.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (quotingConnallyv.General Constr.\nCo., 269 U.\u00a0S. 385, 391 (1926) ). The void-for-vagueness\ndoctrine, as we have called it, guarantees that ordinary people\nhave \u201cfair notice\u201d of the conduct a statute proscribes.Papachristouv.Jacksonville, 405 U.\u00a0S. 156, 162\n(1972) . And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or\ndiscriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide\nstandards to govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors,\njuries, and judges. SeeKolenderv.Lawson, 461\nU.\u00a0S. 352, 357 \u2013358 (1983). In that sense, the doctrine is a\ncorollary of the separation of powers\u2014requiring that Congress,\nrather than the executive or judicial branch, define what conduct\nis sanctionable and what is not. Cf.id.,at 358, n.\u00a07\n(\u201c[I]f the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all\npossible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and\nsay who could be rightfully detained, [it would] substitute the\njudicial for the legislative department\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).The Government argues that a less searching form\nof the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies here than inJohnsonbecause this is not a criminal case. See Brief for\nPetitioner 13\u201315. As the Government notes, this Court has stated\nthat \u201c[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitution [allows]\ndepends in part on the nature of the enactment\u201d: In particular, the\nCourt has \u201cexpressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil\nrather than criminal penalties because the consequences of\nimprecision are qualitatively less severe.\u201dHoffman Estatesv.Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.\u00a0S. 489, 498\n\u2013499 (1982). The removal of an alien is a civil matter. SeeArizonav.United States, 567 U.\u00a0S. 387, 396\n(2012) . Hence, the Govern- ment claims, the need for clarity is\nnot so strong; even a law too vague to support a conviction or\nsentence may be good enough to sustain a deportation order. See\nBrief for Petitioner 25\u201326.But this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses that\nargument, because we long ago held that the most exacting vagueness\nstandard should apply in removal cases. InJordanv.De\nGeorge, we considered whether a provision of immigration law\nmaking an alien deportable if convicted of a \u201ccrime involving moral\nturpitude\u201d was \u201csufficiently definite.\u201d 341 U.\u00a0S. 223, 229\n(1951) . That provision, we noted, \u201cis not a criminal statute\u201d (as\n\u00a716(b) actually is).Id.,at 231;supra,at 1\u20132.\nStill, we chose to test (and ultimately uphold) it \u201cunder the\nestablished criteria of the \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 doctrine\u201d\napplicable to criminal laws. 341 U.\u00a0S., at 231. That approach\nwas demanded, we explained, \u201cin view of the grave nature of\ndeportation,\u201dibid.\u2014a \u201cdrastic measure,\u201d often amounting to\nlifelong \u201cbanishment or exile,\u201dibid.(quotingFong Haw\nTanv.Phelan, 333 U.\u00a0S. 6, 10 (1948) ).Nothing in the ensuing years calls that\nreasoning into question. To the contrary, this Court has reiterated\nthat deportation is \u201ca particularly severe penalty,\u201d which may be\nof greater concern to a convicted alien than \u201cany potential jail\nsentence.\u201dJae Leev.United States, 582 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 11) (quotingPadillav.Kentucky, 559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 365, 368 (2010) ). And we have\nobserved that as federal immigration law increasingly hinged\ndeportation orders on prior convictions, removal proceedings became\never more \u201cintimately related to the criminal process.\u201dChaidezv.United States, 568 U.\u00a0S. 342, 352\n(2013) (quotingPadilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 365). What\nfollows, asJordanrecognized, is the use of the same\nstandard in the two settings.For that reason, the Government cannot take\nrefuge in a more permissive form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine\nthan the oneJohnsonemployed. To salvage \u00a716\u2019s residual\nclause, even for use in immigration hearings, the Gov- ernment must\ninstead persuade us that it is materially clearer than its\nnow-invalidated ACCA counterpart. That is the issue we next\naddress, as guided byJohnson\u2019s analysis.IIIJohnsonis a straightforward decision,\nwith equally straightforward application here. Its principal\nsection begins as follows: \u201cTwo features of [ACCA\u2019s] residual\nclause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.\u201d 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). The opinion then identifies\neach of those features and explains how their joinder produced\n\u201chopeless indeterminacy,\u201d inconsistent with due process.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 7). And with that reasoning,Johnsoneffectively resolved the case now before us. For\n\u00a716\u2019s residual clause has the same two features as ACCA\u2019s, combined\nin the same constitutionally problem- atic way. Consider those two,\njust asJohnsondescribed them:\u201cIn the first place,\u201dJohnsonexplained,\nACCA\u2019s residual clause created \u201cgrave uncertainty about how to\nestimate the risk posed by a crime\u201d because it \u201ctie[d] the judicial\nassessment of risk\u201d to a hypothesis about the crime\u2019s \u201cordinary\ncase.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 5). Under the clause, a\ncourt focused on neither the \u201creal-world facts\u201d nor the bare\n\u201cstatutory elements\u201d of an offense.Ibid.Instead, a court\nwas supposed to \u201cimagine\u201d an \u201cidealized ordinary case of the\ncrime\u201d\u2014or otherwise put, the court had to identify the \u201ckind of\nconduct the \u2018ordinary case\u2019 of a crime involves.\u201dIbid.But\nhow,Johnsonasked, should a court figure that out? By using\na \u201cstatistical analysis of the state reporter? A survey? Expert\nevidence? Google? Gut instinct?\u201dIbid.(internal quotation\nmarks omitted). ACCA provided no guidance, rendering judicial\naccounts of the \u201cordinary case\u201d wholly \u201cspeculative.\u201dIbid.\nJohnsongave as its prime example the crime of attempted bur-\nglary. One judge, contemplating the \u201cordinary case,\u201d would imagine\nthe \u201cviolent encounter\u201d apt to ensue when a \u201cwould-be burglar [was]\nspotted by a police officer [or] private security guard.\u201dId.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136). Another judge would\nconclude that \u201cany confrontation\u201d was more \u201clikely to consist of\n[an observer\u2019s] yelling \u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the\nburglar\u2019s running away.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 6). But\nhow could either judge really know? \u201cThe residual clause,\u201dJohnsonsummarized, \u201coffer[ed] no reliable way\u201d to discern\nwhat the ordinary version of any offense looked like.Ibid.And without that, no one could tell how much risk the offense\ngenerally posed.Compounding that first uncertainty,Johnsoncontinued, was a second: ACCA\u2019s residual clause left\nunclear what threshold level of risk made any given crime a\n\u201cviolent felony.\u201d Seeibid.The Court emphasized that this\nfeature alone would not have violated the void-for-vagueness\ndoctrine: Many perfectly constitutional statutes use imprecise\nterms like \u201cserious potential risk\u201d (as in ACCA\u2019s residual clause)\nor \u201csubstantial risk\u201d (as in \u00a716\u2019s). The problem came from layering\nsuch a standard on top of the requisite \u201cordinary case\u201d inquiry. As\nthe Court explained:\u201c[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality\nof laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard\nsuch as \u2018substantial risk\u2019 to real-world conduct; the law is full\nof instances where a man\u2019s fate depends on his estimating rightly\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. some matter of degree[.] The residual clause,\nhowever, requires application of the \u2018serious potential risk\u2019\nstandard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime. Because the\nelements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are\nuncertain[,] this abstract inquiry offers significantly less\npredictability than one that deals with the actual .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfacts.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (some internal\nquotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).So much less predictability, in fact, that\nACCA\u2019s residual clause could not pass constitutional muster. As the\nCourt again put the point, in the punch line of its decision: \u201cBy\ncombining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a\ncrime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime\nto qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause\u201d violates the\nguarantee of due process.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at\n6).[3]Section 16\u2019s residual clause violates that\npromise in just the same way. To begin whereJohnsondid,\n\u00a716(b) also calls for a court to identify a crime\u2019s \u201cordinary case\u201d\nin order to measure the crime\u2019s risk. The Government explicitly\nacknowledges that point here. See Brief for Petitioner 11 (\u201cSection\n16(b), like [ACCA\u2019s] residual clause, requires a court to assess\nthe risk posed by the ordinary case of a particular offense\u201d). And\nindeed, the Government\u2019s briefing inJohnsonwarned us about\nthat likeness, observing that \u00a716(b) would be \u201cequally susceptible\nto [an] objection\u201d that focused on the problems of positing a\ncrime\u2019s ordinary case. Supp. Brief for Respondent, O.\u00a0T. 2014,\nNo. 13\u20137120, pp.\u00a022\u201323. Nothing in \u00a716(b) helps courts to\nperform that task, just as nothing in ACCA did. We can as well\nrepeat here what we asked inJohnson: How does one go about\ndivining the conduct entailed in a crime\u2019s ordinary case?\nStatistical analyses? Surveys? Experts? Google? Gut instinct? SeeJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5);supra,at 7;post,at 16\u201317 (Gorsuch, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment). And we can as well reiterateJohnson\u2019s example: In the ordinary case of attempted\nburglary, is the would-be culprit spotted and confronted, or scared\noff by a yell? Seepost,at 16 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.)\n(offering other knotty examples). Once again, the questions have no\ngood answers; the \u201cordinary case\u201d remains, asJohnsondescribed it, an excessively \u201cspeculative,\u201d essentially inscrutable\nthing. 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5); accordpost,\nat 27 (Thomas, J., dissenting).[4]And \u00a716(b) also possesses the second fatal\nfeature of ACCA\u2019s residual clause: uncertainty about the level of\nrisk that makes a crime \u201cviolent.\u201d In ACCA, that threshold was\n\u201cserious potential risk\u201d; in \u00a716(b), it is \u201csubstantial risk.\u201d Seesupra,at 2, 4. But the Government does not argue that the\nlatter formulation is any more determinate than the former, and for\ngood reason. As The Chief Justice\u2019s valiant attempt to do so shows,\nthat would be slicing the baloney mighty thin. Seepost,at\n5\u20136 (dissenting opinion). And indeed,Johnsonas much as\nequated the two phrases: Return to the block quote above, and note\nhowJohnson\u2014as though anticipating this case\u2014refers to them\ninterchangeably, as alike examples of imprecise \u201cqualitative\nstandard[s].\u201d Seesupra,at 8; 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). Once again, the point is not that such a non-numeric\nstandard is alone problematic: InJohnson\u2019s words, \u201cwe do\nnot doubt\u201d the constitutionality of applying \u00a716(b)\u2019s \u201csubstantial\nrisk [standard] to real-world conduct.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). The difficulty\ncomes, in \u00a716\u2019s residual clause just as in ACCA\u2019s, from applying\nsuch a standard to \u201ca judge-imagined abstraction\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201can\nidealized ordinary case of the crime.\u201dId.,at ___, ___\n(slip op., at 6, 12). It is then that the standard ceases to work\nin a way consistent with due process.In sum, \u00a716(b) has the same \u201c[t]wo features\u201d\nthat \u201cconspire[d] to make [ACCA\u2019s residual clause]\nunconstitutionally vague.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 5). It\ntoo \u201crequires a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime\ninvolves in \u2018the ordinary case,\u2019 and to judge whether that\nabstraction presents\u201d some\nnot-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-large degree of risk.Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The result is that \u00a716(b)\nproduces, just as ACCA\u2019s residual clause did, \u201cmore\nunpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause\ntolerates.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 6).IVThe Government and dissents offer two\nfundamentally different accounts of how \u00a716(b) can escape unscathed\nfrom our decision inJohnson. Justice Thomas accepts that\nthe ordinary-case inquiry makes \u00a716(b) \u201cimpossible to apply.\u201dPost,at 27. His solution is to overthrow our historic\nunderstanding of the statute: We should now read \u00a716(b), he says,\nto ask about the risk posed by a particular defendant\u2019s particular\nconduct. In contrast, the Government, joined by The Chief Justice,\naccepts that \u00a716(b), as long interpreted, demands a categorical\napproach, rather than a case-specific one. They argue only that\n\u201cdistinctive textual features\u201d of \u00a716\u2019s residual clause make\napplying it \u201cmore predictable\u201d than its ACCA counter- part. Brief\nfor Petitioner 28, 29. We disagree with both arguments.AThe essentials of Justice Thomas\u2019s position go\nas follows. Section 16(b), he says, cannot have one meaning, but\ncould have one of two others. Seepost,at 27. The provision\ncannot demand an inquiry merely into the elements of a crime,\nbecause that is the province of \u00a716(a). Seesupra,at 2\n(setting out \u00a716(a)\u2019s text). But that still leaves a pair of\noptions: the categorical, ordinary-case approach and the\n\u201cunderlying-conduct approach,\u201d which asks about the specific way in\nwhich a defendant committed a crime.Post,at 25. According\nto Justice Thomas, each option is textually viable (although he\ngives a slight nod to the latter based on \u00a716(b)\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cinvolves\u201d). Seepost,at 24\u201326. What tips the scales is\nthat only one\u2014the conduct approach\u2014is at all \u201cworkable.\u201dPost,at 27. The difficulties of the ordinary-case inquiry,\nJustice Thomas rightly observes, underlie this Court\u2019s view that\n\u00a716(b) is too vague. So abandon that inquiry, Justice Thomas urges.\nAfter all, he reasons, it is the Court\u2019s \u201cplain duty,\u201d under the\nconstitutional avoidance canon, to adopt any reasonable\nconstruction of a statute that escapes constitutional problems.Post,at 28\u201329 (quotingUnited States ex rel. Attorney\nGeneralv.Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.\u00a0S.\n366, 407 (1909) ).For anyone who has readJohnson, that\nargument will ring a bell. The dissent there issued the same\ninvitation, based on much the same reasoning, to jettison the\ncategorical approach in residual-clause cases. 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 9\u201313) (opinion of Alito, J.). The Court\ndeclined to do so. It first noted that the Government had not asked\nus to switch to a fact-based inquiry. It then observed that the\nCourt \u201chad good reasons\u201d for originally adopting the categorical\napproach, based partly on ACCA\u2019s text (which, by the way, uses the\nword \u201cinvolves\u201d identi- cally) and partly on the \u201cutter\nimpracticability\u201d of the alter- native.Id.,at ___ (slip\nop., at 13) (majority opinion). \u201cThe only plausible interpretation\u201d\nof ACCA\u2019s residual clause, we concluded, \u201crequires use of the\ncategorical approach\u201d\u2014even if that approach could not in the end\nsatisfy constitutional standards.Ibid.(internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omitted).The same is true here\u2014except more so. To begin\nwhereJohnsondid, the Government once again \u201chas not asked\nus to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\u201dIbid.To the contrary, and as already noted, the Government\nhas conceded at every step the correctness of that statutory\nconstruction. Seesupra,at 9. And this time, the\nGovernment\u2019s decision is even more noteworthy than before\u2014precisely\nbecause theJohnsondissent laid out the opposite view,\npresenting it in prepackaged form for the Government to take off\nthe shelf and use in the \u00a716(b) context. Of course, we are not\nforeclosed from going down Justice Thomas\u2019s path just because the\nGovernment has not done so. But we find it significant that the\nGovernment cannot bring itself to say that the fact-based approach\nJustice Thomas proposes is a tenable interpretation of \u00a716\u2019s\nresidual clause.Perhaps one reason for the Government\u2019s\nreluctance is that such an approach would generate its own\nconstitutional questions. As Justice Thomas relates,post,at 22, 28, this Court adopted the categorical approach in part to\n\u201cavoid[\u00a0] the Sixth Amendment concerns that would arise from\nsentencing courts\u2019 making findings of fact that properly belong to\njuries.\u201dDescampsv.United States, 570 U.\u00a0S.\n254, 267 (2013) . Justice Thomas thinks that issue need not detain\nus here because \u201cthe right of trial by jury ha[s] no application in\na removal proceeding.\u201dPost,at 28 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But although this particular case involves removal,\n\u00a716(b) is a criminal statute, with criminal sentencing\nconsequences. Seesupra,at 2. And this Court has held (it\ncould hardly have done otherwise) that \u201cwe must interpret the\nstatute con- sistently, whether we encounter its application in a\ncriminal or noncriminal context.\u201dLeocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at\n12, n.\u00a08. So Justice Thomas\u2019s suggestion would merely\nping-pong us from one constitutional issue to another. And that\nmeans the avoidance canon cannot serve, as he would like, as the\ninterpretive tie breaker.In any event, \u00a716(b)\u2019s text creates no draw:\nBest read, it demands a categorical approach. Our decisions have\nconsistently understood language in the residual clauses of both\nACCA and \u00a716 to refer to \u201cthe statute of conviction, not to the\nfacts of each defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201dTaylorv.United\nStates, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575, 601 (1990) ; seeLeocal, 543\nU.\u00a0S., at 7 (Section 16 \u201cdirects our focus to the \u2018offense\u2019 of\nconviction .\u00a0.\u00a0. rather than to the particular facts\u201d).\nSimple references to a \u201cconviction,\u201d \u201cfelony,\u201d or \u201coffense,\u201d we\nhave stated, are \u201cread naturally\u201d to denote the \u201ccrime asgenerallycommitted.\u201dNijhawanv.Holder, 557\nU.\u00a0S. 29, 34 (2009) ; seeLeocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 7;Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). And the\nwords \u201cby its nature\u201d in \u00a716(b) make that meaning all the clearer.\nThe statute, recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense,by its nature, poses the requisite risk of force. An\noffense\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d means its \u201cnormal and characteristic quality.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1507 (2002). So \u00a716(b)\ntells courts to figure out what an offense normally\u2014or, as we have\nrepeatedly said, \u201cordinarily\u201d\u2014entails, not what happened to occur\non one occasion. And the same conclusion follows if we pay\nattention to language that ismissingfrom \u00a716(b). As we\nhave observed in the ACCA context, the absence of terms alluding to\na crime\u2019s circumstances, or its commission, makes a fact-based\ninterpretation an uncomfortable fit. SeeDescamps, 570\nU.\u00a0S., at 267. If Congress had wanted judges to look into a\nfelon\u2019s actual conduct, \u201cit presumably would have said so; other\nstatutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.\u201dId.,at 267\u2013268.[5] The upshot of\nall this textual evidence is that \u00a716\u2019s residual clause\u2014like\nACCA\u2019s, except still more plainly\u2014has no \u201cplausible\u201d fact-based\nreading.Johnson,576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n13).And finally, the \u201cutter impracticability\u201d\u2014and\nassociated inequities\u2014of such an interpretation is as great in the\none statute as in the other.Ibid.This Court has often\ndescribed the daunting difficulties of accurately\n\u201creconstruct[ing],\u201d often many years later, \u201cthe conduct underlying\n[a] conviction.\u201dIbid.;Descamps, 570 U.\u00a0S., at\n270;Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 601\u2013602. According to\nJustice Thomas, we need not worry here because immigration judges\nhave some special factfinding talent, or at least experience, that\nwould mitigate the risk of error attaching to that endeavor in\nfederal courts. Seepost,at 30. But we cannot see putting\nso much weight on the superior factfinding prowess of (notoriously\noverburdened) immigration judges. And as we have said before,\n\u00a716(b) is a criminal statute with applications outside the\nimmigration context. Seesupra,at 2, 13. Once again, then,\nwe have no ground for discovering a novel interpretation of \u00a716(b)\nthat would remove us from the dictates ofJohnson.BAgreeing that is so, the Government (joined by\nThe Chief Justice) takes a narrower path to the same desired\nresult. It points to three textual discrepancies between ACCA\u2019s\nresidual clause and \u00a716(b), and argues that they make \u00a716(b)\nsignificantly easier to apply. But each turns out to be the\nproverbial distinction without a difference. None relates to the\npair of features\u2014the ordinary-case inquiry and a hazy risk\nthreshold\u2014thatJohnsonfound to produce impermissible\nvagueness. And none otherwise affects the determinacy of the\nstatutory inquiry into whether a prior conviction is for a violent\ncrime. That is why, contrary to the Government\u2019s final argument,\nthe experience of applyingbothstatutes has generated\nconfusion and division among lower courts.1The Government first\u2014and foremost\u2014relies on\n\u00a716(b)\u2019s express requirement (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise\nfrom acts taken \u201cin the course of committing the offense.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 31. (The Chief Justice\u2019s dissent echoes much of this\nargument. Seepost,at 6\u20137.) Because of that \u201ctemporal\nrestriction,\u201d a court applying \u00a716(b) may not \u201cconsider risks\narisingafter\u201d the offense\u2019s commission is over.Ibid.In the Government\u2019s view, \u00a716(b)\u2019s text thereby\ndemands a \u201csignificantly more focused inquiry\u201d than did ACCA\u2019s\nresidual clause.Id.,at 32.To assess that claim, start with the meaning of\n\u00a716(b)\u2019s \u201cin the course of\u201d language. That phrase, understood in\nthe normal way, includes the conduct occurring throughout a crime\u2019s\ncommission\u2014not just the conduct sufficient to satisfy the offense\u2019s\nformal elements. The Government agrees with that construction,\nexplaining that the words \u201cin the course of\u201d sweep in everything\nthat happens while a crime continues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\u201358\n(Oct. 2, 2017) (illustrating that idea with reference to\nconspiracy, burglary, kidnapping, and escape from prison). So, for\nexample, conspiracy may be a crime of violence under \u00a716(b) because\nof the risk of force while the conspiracy is ongoing (i.e.,\u201cin the course of\u201d the conspiracy); it is irrelevant that\nconspiracy\u2019s elements are met as soon as the participants have made\nan agreement. Seeibid.;United Statesv.Doe,\n49 F.\u00a03d 859, 866 (CA2 1995). Similarly, and closer to home,\nburglary may be a crime of violence under \u00a716(b) because of the\nprospects of an encounter while the burglar remains in a building\n(i.e.,\u201cin the course of\u201d the burglary); it does not matter\nthat the elements of the crime are met at the precise moment of his\nentry. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\u201358 (Oct. 2, 2017);James, 550\nU.\u00a0S., at 203. In other words, a court applying \u00a716(b) gets to\nconsider everything that is likely to take place for as long as a\ncrime is being committed.Because that is so, \u00a716(b)\u2019s \u201cin the course of\u201d\nlanguage does little to narrow or focus the statutory inquiry. All\nthat the phrase excludes is a court\u2019s ability to consider the risk\nthat force will be used after the crime has entirely concluded\u2014so,\nfor example, after the conspiracy has dissolved or the burglar has\nleft the building. We can construct law-school-type hypotheticals\nfitting that fact pattern\u2014say, a burglar who constructs a booby\ntrap that later knocks out the homeowner. But such imaginative\nforays cannot realistically affect a court\u2019s view of theordinary caseof a crime, which is all that matters under\nthe statute. Seesupra,at 2\u20133, 7. In the ordinary case, the\nriskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its\ncommission, not events occurring later. So with or without \u00a716(b)\u2019s\nexplicit temporal language, a court applying the section would do\nthe same thing\u2014ask what usually happens when a crime goes down.And that is just what courts did when applying\nACCA\u2019s residual clause\u2014and for the same reason. True, that clause\nlacked an express temporal limit. But not a single one of this\nCourt\u2019s ACCA decisions turned on conduct that might occur after a\ncrime\u2019s commission; instead, each hinged on the risk arising from\nevents that could happen while the crime was ongoing. See,e.g.,\nSykesv.United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10 (2011)\n(assessing the risks attached to the \u201cconfrontations that initiate\nand terminate\u201d vehicle flight, along with \u201cintervening\u201d events);Chambersv.United States, 555 U.\u00a0S. 122, 128\n(2009) (rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that violent incidents\n\u201coccur[ring] long after\u201d a person unlawfully failed to report to\nprison rendered that crime a violent felony). Nor could those\ndecisions have done otherwise, given the statute\u2019s concern with the\nordinary (rather than the outlandish) case. Once again, the\nriskiness of a crime in the ordinary case depends on the acts taken\nduring\u2014not after\u2014its commission. Thus, the analyses under ACCA\u2019s\nresidual clause and \u00a716(b) coincide.The upshot is that the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d\nmakes no difference as to either outcome or clarity. Every offense\nthat could have fallen within ACCA\u2019s residual clause might equally\nfall within \u00a716(b). And the difficulty of deciding whether it does\nso remains just as intractable. Indeed, we cannot think of a single\nfederal crime whose treatment becomes more obvious under \u00a716(b)\nthan under ACCA because of the words \u201cin the course of.\u201d[6] The phrase, then, cannot cure the\nstatutory indeterminacyJohnsondescribed.Second, the Government (and again, The Chief\nJustice\u2019s dissent, seepost,at 6) observes that \u00a716(b)\nfocuses on the risk of \u201cphysical force\u201d whereas ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause asked about the risk of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d The \u00a716(b)\ninquiry, the Government says, \u201ctrains solely\u201d on the conduct\ntypically involved in a crime. Brief for Petitioner 36. By\ncontrast, the Government continues, ACCA\u2019s residual clause required\na second inquiry: After describing the ordinary criminal\u2019s conduct,\na court had to \u201cspeculate about a chain of causation that could\npossibly result in a victim\u2019s injury.\u201dIbid.The\nGovernment\u2019s conclusion is that the \u00a716(b) inquiry is \u201cmore\nspecific.\u201dIbid.But once more, we struggle to see how that\nstatutory distinction would matter. To begin with, the first of the\nGovernment\u2019s two steps\u2014defining the conduct in the ordinary case\u2014is\nalmost always the difficult part. Once that is accomplished, the\nassessment of consequences tends to follow as a matter of course.\nSo, for example, if a crime is likely enough to lead to a shooting,\nit will also be likely enough to lead to an injury. And still more\nimportant, \u00a716(b) involves two steps as well\u2014and essentially the\nsame ones. In interpreting statutes like \u00a716(b), this Court has\nmade clear that \u201cphysical force\u201d means \u201cforce capable of causing\nphysical pain or injury.\u201dJohnsonv.United States,\n559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 140 (2010) (defining the term for purposes of\ndeciding what counts as a \u201cviolent\u201d crime). So under \u00a716(b) too, a\ncourt must not only identify the conduct typically involved in a\ncrime, but also gauge its potential consequences. Or said a bit\ndifferently, evaluating the risk of \u201cphysical force\u201d itself entails\nconsidering the risk of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d For those reasons, the\nforce/injury distinction is unlikely to affect a court\u2019s analysis\nof whether a crime qualifies as violent. All the same crimes\nmight\u2014or, then again, might not\u2014satisfy both requirements.\nAccordingly, this variance in wording cannot make ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause vague and \u00a716(b) not.Third, the Government briefly notes that \u00a716(b),\nunlike ACCA\u2019s residual clause, is not preceded by a \u201cconfusing list\nof exemplar crimes.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 38. (The Chief Justice\u2019s\ndissent reiterates this argument, with some additional references\nto our caselaw. Seepost,at 10\u201312.) Here, the Government is\nreferring to the offenses ACCA designated as violent felonies\nindependently of the residual clause (i.e., burglary, arson,\nextortion, and use of explosives). Seesupra,at 4.\nAccording to the Government, those crimes provided \u201ccontradictory\nand opaque indications\u201d of what non-specified offenses should also\ncount as violent. Brief for Petitioner 38. Because \u00a716(b) lacks any\nsuch enumerated crimes, the Government concludes, it avoids the\nvagueness of ACCA\u2019s residual clause.We readily accept a part of that argument. This\nCourt for several years looked to ACCA\u2019s listed crimes for help in\ngiving the residual clause meaning. See,e.g., Begayv.United States, 553 U.\u00a0S. 137, 142 (2008) ;James, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 203. But to no avail. As the\nGovernment relates (andJohnsonexplained), the enumerated\ncrimes were themselves too varied to provide such assistance. See\nBrief for Petitioner 38\u201340; 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). Trying to reconcile them with each other, and then compare\nthem to whatever unlisted crime was at issue, drove many a judge a\nlittle batty. And more to the point, the endeavor failed to bring\nany certainty to the residual clause\u2019s application. See Brief for\nPetitioner 38\u201340.But the Government\u2019s conclusion does not follow.\nTo say that ACCA\u2019s listed crimes failed to resolve the residual\nclause\u2019s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem. Had\nthey done so,Johnsonwould not have needed to strike down\nthe clause. It could simply have instructed courts to give up on\ntrying to interpret the clause by reference to the enumerated\noffenses. (Contrary to The Chief Justice\u2019s suggestion, seepost,at 12, discarding an interpretive tool once it is\nfound not to actually aid in interpretation hardly \u201cexpand[s]\u201d the\nscope of a statute.) ThatJohnsonwent so much\nfurther\u2014invalidating a statutory provision rather than construing\nit independently of another\u2014demonstrates that the list of crimes\nwas not the culprit. And indeed,Johnsonexplicitly said as\nmuch. As described earlier,Johnsonfound the residual\nclause\u2019s vagueness to reside in just \u201ctwo\u201d of its features: the\nordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard. See 576\nU.\u00a0S.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136);supra,at\n7\u20138. Strip away the enumerated crimes\u2014as Congress did in \u00a716(b)\u2014and\nthose dual flaws yet remain. And ditto the textual indeterminacy\nthat flows from them.2Faced with the two clauses\u2019 linguistic\nsimilarity, the Government relies significantly on an argument\nrooted in judicial experience. Our opinion inJohnson, the\nGovernment notes, spoke of the longstanding \u201ctrouble\u201d that this\nCourt and others had in \u201cmaking sense of [ACCA\u2019s] residual clause.\u201d\n576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see Brief for Petitioner\n45. According to the Government, \u00a716(b) has not produced\n\u201ccomparable difficulties.\u201dId.,at 46. Lower courts, the\nGovernment claims, have divided less often about the provision\u2019s\nmeaning, and as a result this Court granted certiorari on \u201conly a\nsingle Section 16(b) case\u201d before this one.Ibid.[7] \u201cThe most likely explanation,\u201d the\nGovernment concludes, is that \u201cSection 16(b) is clearer\u201d than its\nACCA counterpart.Id.,at 47.But in fact, a host of issues respecting\n\u00a716(b)\u2019s application to specific crimes divide the federal\nappellate courts. Does car burglary qualify as a violent felony\nunder \u00a716(b)? Some courts say yes, another says no.[8] What of statutory rape? Once again, the\nCircuits part ways.[9] How\nabout evading arrest? The decisions point in different\ndirections.[10] Residential\ntrespass? The same is true.[11] Those examples do not exhaust the current catalogue\nof Circuit conflicts concerning \u00a716(b)\u2019s application. See Brief for\nNational Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae7\u201318 (citing divided appellate\ndecisions as to the unauthorized use of a vehicle, firearms\npossession, and abduction). And that roster would just expand with\ntime, mainly because, asJohnsonexplained, precious few\ncrimes (of the thousands that fill the statute books) have an\nobvious, non-speculative\u2014and therefore undisputed\u2014\u201cordinary case.\u201d\nSee 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20136).Nor does this Court\u2019s prior handling of \u00a716(b)\ncases support the Government\u2019s argument. To be sure, we have heard\noral argument in only two cases arising from \u00a716(b) (including this\none), as compared with five involving ACCA\u2019s residual clause\n(includingJohnson).[12] But while some of those ACCA suits were pending\nbefore us, we received a number of petitions for certiorari\npresenting related issues in the \u00a716(b) context. And after issuing\nthe relevant ACCA decisions, we vacated the judgments in those\n\u00a716(b) cases and remanded them for further consideration.[13] That we disposed of the ACCA and\n\u00a716(b) petitions in that order, rather than its opposite, provides\nno reason to disregard the indeterminacy that \u00a716(b) shares with\nACCA\u2019s residual clause.And of course, this Court\u2019s experience in\ndeciding ACCA cases only supports the conclusion that \u00a716(b) is too\nvague. For that record reveals that a statute with all the same\nhallmarks as \u00a716(b) could not be applied with the predictability\nthe Constitution demands. Seeid.,at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n6\u20139);supra,at 6\u20139. The Government would condemn us to\nrepeat the past\u2014to rerun the old ACCA tape, as though we remembered\nnothing from its first showing. But why should we disregard a\nlesson so hard learned? \u201cInsanity,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote in the\nlast ACCA residual clause case beforeJohnson, \u201cis doing the\nsame thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\u201dSykes, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 28 (dissenting opinion). We\nabandoned that lunatic practice inJohnsonand see no reason\nto start it again.VJohnsontells us how to resolve this\ncase. That decision held that \u201c[t]wo features of [ACCA\u2019s] residual\nclause conspire[d] to make it unconstitutionally vague.\u201d 576\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Because the clause had both an\nordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk threshold, it\nnecessarily \u201cdevolv[ed] into guesswork and intuition,\u201d invited\narbitrary enforcement, and failed to provide fair notice.Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 8). Section 16(b) possesses the\nexact same two features. And none of the minor linguistic\ndisparities in the statutes makes any real difference. So just like\nACCA\u2019s residual clause, \u00a716(b) \u201cproduces more unpredictability and\narbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 6). We accordingly affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.It is so ordered.Notes1The analysis thus differs\nfrom the form of categorical approach used to determine whether a\nprior conviction is for a particular listed offense (say, murder or\narson). In that context, courts ask what the elements of a given\ncrime always require\u2014in effect, what is legally necessary for a\nconviction. See,e.g., Descampsv.United States, 570\nU.\u00a0S. 254, 260 \u2013261 (2013);Moncrieffev.Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. 184, 190 \u2013191 (2013).2CompareShutiv.Lynch, 828 F.3d 440 (CA6 2016) (finding \u00a716(b)\nunconstitutionally vague);United Statesv.Vivas-Ceja, 808 F.\u00a03d 719 (CA7 2015) (same), withUnited Statesv.Gonzalez-Longoria, 831 F.\u00a03d\n670 (CA5 2016) (en banc) (upholding \u00a716(b)).3Johnsonalso\nanticipated and rejected a significant aspect of Justice Thomas\u2019s\ndissent in this case. According to Justice Thomas, a court may not\ninvalidate a statute for vagueness if it is clear in any of its\napplications\u2014as he thinks is true ofcompletedburglary,\nwhich is the offense Dimaya committed. Seepost,at 16\u201320.\nBut as an initial matter,Johnsonexplained that supposedly\neasy applications of the residual clause might not be \u201cso easy\nafter all.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201311). The\ncrime of completed burglary at issue here illustrates that point\nforcefully. Seeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 6) (asking whether\n\u201can ordinary burglar invade[s] an occupied home by night or an\nunoccupied home by day\u201d);Dimayav.Lynch,803\nF.\u00a03d 1110, 1116, n.\u00a07 (CA9 2015) (noting that only about\nseven percent of burglaries actually involve violence); Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7459, 460 (West 2010) (sweeping so broadly as to cover\neven dishonest door-to-door salesmen). And still more\nfundamentally,Johnsonmade clear that our decisions\n\u201csquarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is\nconstitutional merely because there is some conduct that clearly\nfalls within the provision\u2019s grasp.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 11).4The Chief Justice\u2019s\ndissent makes light of the difficulty of identifying a crime\u2019s\nordinary case. In a single footnote, The Chief Justice portrays\nthat task as no big deal: Just eliminate the \u201catypical\u201d cases, and\n(presto!) the crime\u2019s nature and risk are revealed. Seepost,at 5, n.\u00a01. That rosy view\u2014at complete odds withJohnson\u2014underlies his whole dissent (and especially, his\nanalysis of how \u00a716(b) applies to particular offenses, seepost,at 7\u201310). In effect, The Chief Justice is able to\nconclude that \u00a716(b) can surviveJohnsononly by refusing to\nacknowledge one of the two core insights of that\ndecision.5For example, inUnited\nStatesv.Hayes, 555 U.\u00a0S. 415 (2009) , this Court\nheld that a firearms statute referring to former crimes as\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d specified persons requires courts to consider\nunderlying facts.Id.,at 421. And inNijhawanv.Holder, 557 U.\u00a0S. 29 (2009) , the Court similarly\nadopted a non-categorical interpretation of one of the aggravated\nfelonies listed in the INA because of the phrase, appended to the\nnamed offense, \u201cin which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds\n$10,000.\u201dId.,at 34, 36 (emphasis deleted). Justice Thomas\nsuggests thatNijhawanrejected the relevance of our ACCA\nprecedents in interpreting the INA\u2019s aggravated-felony\nlist\u2014including its incorporation of \u00a716(b).Post,at 29\u201330.\nBut that misreads the decision. InNijhawan, we considered\nan item on the INA\u2019s list that looks nothing like ACCA, and we\nconcluded\u2014no surprise here\u2014that our ACCA decisions did not offer a\nuseful guide. As to items on the INA\u2019s list thatdomirror\nACCA, the opposite conclusion of course follows.6In response to repeated\nquestioning at two oral arguments, the Government proposed one (and\nonly one) such crime\u2014but we disagree that \u00a716(b)\u2019s temporal\nlanguage would aid in its analysis. According to the Government,\npossession of a short-barreled shotgun could count as violent under\nACCA but not under \u00a716(b) because shooting the gun is \u201cnot in the\ncourse of committing the crime of possession.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg.\n59\u201360 (Oct. 2, 2017); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\u20137 (Jan. 17, 2017);\nBrief for Petitioner 32\u201334. That is just wrong: When a criminal\nshoots a gun, he does so while (\u201cin the course of\u00a0\u201d)\npossessing it (except perhaps in some physics-defying fantasy\nworld). What makes the offense difficult to classify as violent is\nsomething different: that while some people use the short-barreled\nshotguns they possess to commit murder, others merely store them in\na nearby firearms cabinet\u2014and it is hard to settle which is the\nmore likely scenario. CompareJohnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 19\u201320) (Alito, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt is\nfanciful to assume that a person who [unlawfully possesses] a\nnotoriously dangerous weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in\nviolent ways\u201d), withid.,at ___ (slip op., at 4) (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (Unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun\n\u201ctakes place in a variety of ways .\u00a0.\u00a0. many, perhaps\nmost, of which do not involve likely accompanying violence\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). But contrary to The Chief\nJustice\u2019s suggestion, seepost,at 7\u20138 (which, again, is\ntied to his disregard of the ordinary-case inquiry, seesupra,at 10, n. 4), that issue must be settled no less\nunder \u00a716(b) than under ACCA.7And, The Chief Justice\nemphasizes, we decided that one unanimously! Seepost,at 3\n(discussingLeocalv.Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1\n(2004) ). But one simple application does not a clear statute make.\nAs we put the point inJohnson: Our decisions \u201csquarely\ncontradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional\nmerely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the\nprovision\u2019s grasp.\u201d 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); seesupra,at 9, n.\u00a04.8CompareEscudero-Arciniegav.Holder, 702 F.\u00a03d 781,\n784\u2013785 (CA5 2012) (per curiam) (yes, it does), andUnited Statesv.Guzman-Landeros, 207 F.\u00a03d\n1034, 1035 (CA8 2000) (per curiam) (same), withSareang\nYev.INS, 214 F.\u00a03d 1128, 1133\u20131134 (CA9 2000)\n(no, it does not).9CompareAguiarv.Gonzales, 438 F.\u00a03d 86, 89\u201390 (CA1 2006) (statutory\nrape involves a substantial risk of force);Cheryv.Ashcroft, 347 F.\u00a03d 404, 408\u2013409 (CA2 2003) (same); andUnited Statesv.Velazquez-Overa, 100 F.\u00a03d 418,\n422 (CA5 1996) (same), withValenciav.Gonzales, 439\nF.\u00a03d 1046, 1052 (CA9 2006) (statutory rape does not involve\nsuch a risk).10CompareDixonv.Attorney\nGen., 768 F.\u00a03d 1339, 1343\u20131346 (CA11 2014) (holding that\none such statute falls under \u00a716(b)), withFlores-Lopezv.Holder, 685 F.\u00a03d 857, 863\u2013865 (CA9 2012) (holding that\nanother does not).11CompareUnited Statesv.Venegas-Ornelas, 348 F.\u00a03d 1273, 1277\u20131278 (CA10 2003)\n(residential trespass is a crime of violence), withZivkovicv.Holder, 724 F.\u00a03d 894, 906 (CA7 2013) (it is\nnot).12From\nall we can tell\u2014and all the Government has told us, see Brief for\nPetitioner 45\u201352\u2014lower courts have also decided many fewer cases\ninvolving \u00a716(b) than ACCA\u2019s residual clause. That disparity likely\nreflects the Government\u2019s lesser need to rely on \u00a716(b). That\nprovision is mainly employed (as here) in the immigration context,\nto establish an \u201caggravated felony\u201d requiring deportation. Seesupra,at 2. But immigration law offers many other ways to\nachieve that result. The INA lists 80 or so crimes that count as\naggravated felonies; only if a conviction is not for one of those\nspecified offenses need the Government resort to \u00a716(b) (or another\ncatch-all provision). SeeLuna Torresv.Lynch, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2). By contrast, ACCA\nenumerates only four crimes as a basis for enhancing sentences; the\nGovernment therefore had reason to use the statute\u2019s residual\nclause more often.13See,e.g., Amendariz-Morenov.United States, 555\nU.\u00a0S. 1133 (2009) (vacating and remanding for reconsideration\nin light ofBegayv.United States, 553 U.\u00a0S.\n137 (2008) , andChambersv.United States, 555\nU.\u00a0S. 122 (2009) );Castillo-Luciov.United\nStates, 555 U.\u00a0S. 1133 (2009) (same);Addov.Mukasey, 555 U.\u00a0S. 1132 (2009) (vacating and remanding\nin light ofChambers);Serna-Guerrav.Holder,\n556 U.\u00a0S 1279 (2009) (same);Reyes-Figueroav.United States, 555 U.\u00a0S. 1132 (2009)\n(same).",
