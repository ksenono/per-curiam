    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 15\u2013415_________________ENCINO MOTORCARS, LLC, PETITIONERv.HECTOR NAVARRO, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 20, 2016]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins,\ndissenting.The Court granted this case to decide whether an\nexemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201et seq., \u201crequires payment of\nincreased compensation to certain automobile dealership employees\u201d\u2014\nknown as service advisors\u2014\u201cfor overtime work.\u201dAnte, at 1;\nsee alsoante,at 2, 7. The majority declines to resolve\nthat question. Instead, after explaining why the Court owes no\ndeference to the Department of Labor\u2019s regulation purporting to\ninterpret this provision, seeChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.\nInc.v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\nU.\u00a0S. 837, 843 (1984) , the majority leaves it \u201cfor the Court\nof Appeals to interpret the statute in the first instance.\u201dAnte,at 12.I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that we\nowe noChevrondeference to the Department\u2019s position\nbecause \u201cdeference is not warranted where [a] regulation is\n\u2018procedurally defective.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 8. But I disagree\nwith its ultimate decision to punt on the issue before it. We have\nan \u201cobligation .\u00a0.\u00a0. to decide the merits of the question\npresented.\u201dCBOCS West, Inc.v.Humphries, 553\nU.\u00a0S. 442, 472 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting). We need not\nwade into the murky waters ofChevrondeference to decide\nwhether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute was correct. We\nmust instead examine the statutory text. That text reveals that\nservice advisors are salesmen primarily engaged in the selling of\nservices for automobiles. Accordingly, I would reverse the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s judgment. Federal law requires overtime pay for certain\nemployees who work more than 40 hours per week. \u00a7207(a)(2)(C). But\nthe FLSA exempts various categories of employees from this overtime\nrequirement. \u00a7213. The question before the Court is whether the\nfollowing exemption encompasses service advisors:\u201cThe provisions of section 207 of this title\nshall not apply with respect to\u2014.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003. \u201c(10)(A) any salesman,\npartsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing\nautomobiles, trucks, or farm implements, if he is employed by a\nnonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of\nselling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.\u201d\n\u00a7213(b).I start with the uncontroversial notion that a\nservice advisor is a \u201csalesman.\u201d The FLSA does not define the term\n\u201csalesman,\u201d so \u201cwe give the term its ordinary meaning.\u201dTaniguchiv.Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5). A \u201csalesman\u201d is someone who sells\ngoods or services. 14 Oxford English Dictionary 391 (2d ed. 1989)\n(\u201c[a] man whose business it is to sell goods or conduct sales\u201d);\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1262 (1966) (Random\nHouse) (\u201ca man who sells goods, services, etc.\u201d). Service advisors,\nwhose role it is to \u201cinteract with customers and sell them services\nfor their vehicles,\u201dante,at 2, are plainly \u201csalesm[e]n.\u201d\nSeeibid.(cataloguing sales-related duties of service\nadvisors).A service advisor, however, is not \u201cprimarily\nengaged in selling .\u00a0.\u00a0. automobiles.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A). On\nthe contrary, a service advisor is a \u201csalesman\u201d who sells servicing\nsolutions.Ante,at 2. So the exemption applies only if it\ncov-ersnot onlythose salesmen primarily engaged in selling\nautomobilesbut alsothose salesmen primarily engaged in\nservicing automobiles.The exemption\u2019s structure confirms that salesmen\ncould do both. The exemption contains three nouns (\u201csalesman,\npartsman, or mechanic\u201d) and two gerunds (\u201cselling or servicing\u201d).\nThe three nouns are connected by the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d as are the\ngerunds. So unless context dictates otherwise, a salesman caneitherbe engaged in sellingorservicing\nautomobiles. Cf.Reiterv.Sonotone Corp., 442\nU.\u00a0S. 330, 339 (1979) .Context does not dictate otherwise. A salesman,\nnamely, one who sells servicing solutions, can be \u201cprimarily\nengaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A).\nThe FLSA does not define the term \u201cservicing,\u201d but its ordinary\nmeaning includes both \u201c[t]he action of maintaining or repairing a\nmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201cthe action of providing a service.\u201d 15 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 39; see also Random House 1304 (defining\n\u201cservice\u201d to mean \u201cthe providing .\u00a0.\u00a0. of .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nactivities required by the public, as maintenance, repair, etc.\u201d).\nA service advisor\u2019s selling of service solutions fits both\ndefinitions. The service advisor is the customer\u2019s liaison for\npurposes of deciding what parts are necessary to maintain or repair\na vehicle, and therefore is primarily engaged in \u201cthe action of\nmaintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\u201d or \u201cthe action of\nproviding a service\u201d for an automobile.Other features of the exemption confirm that a\nservice advisor is a salesman primarily engaged in servicing\nautomobiles. Consider the exemption\u2019s application to a \u201cpartsman.\u201d\nLike a service advisor, a partsman neither sells vehicles nor\nrepairs vehicles himself. See 29 CFR \u00a7779.372(c)(2) (2015)\n(defining \u201cpartsman\u201d as \u201cany employee employed for the purpose of\nand primarily engaged in requisitioning, stocking, and dispensing\nparts\u201d). For the provision to exempt partsmen, then, the phrase\n\u201cprimarily engaged in . . . servicing\u201d must cover some employees\nwho do not themselves perform repair or maintenance. So \u201cservicing\u201d\nrefers not only to the physical act of repairing or maintaining a\nvehicle but also to acts integral to the servicing process more\ngenerally.Respondents\u2019 contrary contentions are\nunavailing. They first invoke the distributive canon: \u201cWhere a\nsentence contains several antecedents and several consequents,\u201d the\ndistributive canon instructs courts to \u201cread [those several terms]\ndistributively and apply the words to the subjects which, by\ncontext, they seem most properly to relate.\u201d 2A N. Singer & S.\nSinger, Sutherland on Statu-tory Construction \u00a747.26, on p. 448\n(rev. 7th ed. 2014). Respondents accordingly maintain that 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7213(b)(10)(A) exemptsonlysalesmen\nprimarily engaged in selling automobiles. Brief for Respondents\n20\u201326. But the distributive canon is less helpful in cases such as\nthis because the antecedents and consequents cannot be read-ily\nmatched on a one-to-one basis. Here, there are three nouns to be\nmatched with only two gerunds, so the canon does not overcome the\nexemption\u2019s plain meaning. Perhaps respondents might have a better\nargument if the statute exempted \u201csalesman or mechanics who\nprimarily engage in selling or servicing automobiles.\u201d In such a\ncase, one might assume that Congress meant the nouns and gerunds to\nmatch on a one-to-one basis, and the distributive canon could be\nutilized to determine how the matching should occur. But that is\nnot the statute before us. For the reasons explained,supra,at 3\u20134, the plain meaning of the various terms in the exemption\nestablish that the term \u201csalesman\u201d is not limited to only those who\nsell automobiles. It also extends to those \u201cprimarily engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles.\u201d \u00a7213(b)(10)(A).Respondents also resist this natural reading of\nthe exemption by invoking the made-up canon that courts must\nnarrowly construe the FLSA exemptions. Brief for Respondents 41\u201342.\nThe Ninth Circuit agreed with respondents on this score. 780\nF.\u00a03d 1267, 1271\u20131272, n.\u00a03 (2015). The court should not\ndo so again on remand. We have declined to apply that canon on two\nrecent occasions, one of which also required the Court to parse the\nmeaning of an exemption in \u00a7213.Christopherv.SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. ___, ___\u2013___, n. 21\n(2012) (slip op., at 19\u201320, n. 21); see alsoSandiferv.United States Steel Corp., 571 U.S. ___, ___, n. 7 (2014)\n(slip op., at 11, n.\u00a07). There is no basis to infer that\nCongress means anything beyond what a statute plainly says simply\nbecause the legislation in question could be classified as\n\u201cremedial.\u201d See Scalia, Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal\nAnalysis, 40 Case W. Res. L.\u00a0Rev. 581, 581\u2013586 (1990). Indeed,\nthis canon appears to \u201cres[t] on an elemental misunderstanding of\nthe legislative process,\u201d viz., \u201cthat Congress intend[s] statutes\nto extend as far as possible in service of a singular objective.\u201d\nBrief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae7.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the\nFLSA exemption set out in \u00a7213(b)(10)(A) covers the service\nadvisors in this case. Service advisors are \u201cprimarily engaged in\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. servicing automobiles,\u201d given their integral role\nin selling and providing vehicle services. Accordingly, I would\nreverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.",
