While history looms large in this debate, I find the\nhistorical record more silent than supportive on the question\nwhether the founding generation understood the First Amendment to\nrequire religious exemptions from generally applicable laws in at\nleast some circumstances. In my view, the textual and structural\narguments againstSmithare more compelling. As a matter of\ntext and structure, it is difficult to see why the Free Exercise\nClause\u2014lone among the First Amendment freedoms\u2014offers nothing more\nthan protection from discrimination.Yet what should replaceSmith? The\nprevailing assumption seems to be that strict scrutiny would apply\nwhenever a neutral and generally applicable law burdens religious\nexercise. But I am skeptical about swappingSmith\u2019s\ncategorical antidiscrimination approach for an equally categorical\nstrict scrutiny regime, particularly when this Court\u2019s resolution\nof conflicts between generally applicable laws and other First\nAmendment rights\u2014like speech and assembly\u2014has been much more\nnuanced. There would be a number of issues to work through ifSmithwere overruled. To name a few: Should entities like\nCatholic Social Services\u2014which is an arm of the Catholic Church\u2014be\ntreated differently than individuals? Cf.Hosanna-Tabor\nEvangelical Lutheran Church and Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171(2012). Should there be a distinction between indirect and\ndirect burdens on religious exercise? Cf.Braunfeldv.Brown,366 U.S.\n599, 606\u2013607 (1961) (plurality opinion). What forms of scrutiny\nshould apply? CompareSherbertv.Verner,374 U.S.\n398, 403 (1963) (assessing whether government\u2019s interest is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018compelling\u2019\u00a0\u201d), withGillettev.United\nStates,401 U.S.\n437, 462 (1971) (assessing whether government\u2019s interest is\n\u201csubstantial\u201d). And if the answer is strict scrutiny, would\npre-Smithcases rejecting free exercise challenges to\ngarden-variety laws come out the same way? SeeSmith, 494\nU.\u00a0S., at 888\u2013889.We need not wrestle with these questions in this\ncase, though, because the same standard applies regardless whetherSmithstays or goes. A longstanding tenet of our free\nexercise jurisprudence\u2014one that both pre-dates and survivesSmith\u2014is that a law burdening religious exercise must\nsatisfy strict scrutiny if it gives government officials discretion\nto grant individualized exemptions. Seeid.,at 884 (law not\ngenerally applicable \u201cwhere the State has in place a system of\nindividual exemptions\u201d (citingSherbert, 374 U.\u00a0S., at\n401, n.\u00a04)); see alsoCantwellv.Connecticut,310 U.S.\n296, 303\u2013307 (1940) (subjecting statute to heightened scrutiny\nbecause exemptions lay in discretion of government official). As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion today explains, the government contract at\nissue provides for individualized exemptions from its\nnondiscrimination rule, thus triggering strict scrutiny. And all\nnine Justices agree that the City cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. I\ntherefore see no reason to decide in this case whetherSmithshould be overruled, much less what should replace it. I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion in full.",
