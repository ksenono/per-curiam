HORNE, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 22, 2015]Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court.Under the United States Department of\nAgriculture\u2019s California Raisin Marketing Order, a percentage of a\ngrower\u2019s crop must be physically set aside in certain years for the\naccount of the Government, free of charge. The Government then\nsells, allocates, or otherwise disposes of the raisins in ways it\ndetermines are best suited to maintaining an orderly market. The\nquestion is whether the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars\nthe Government from imposing such a demand on the growers without\njust compensation.IThe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of\n1937 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate\n\u201cmarketing orders\u201d to help maintain stable markets for particular\nagricultural products. The marketing order for raisins requires\ngrowers in certain years to give a percentage of their crop to the\nGovernment, free of charge. The required allocation is determined\nby the Raisin Administrative Committee, a Government entity\ncomposed largely of growers and others in the raisin business\nappointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. In 2002\u20132003, this\nCommittee ordered raisin growers to turn over 47 percent of their\ncrop. In 2003\u20132004, 30 percent.Growers generally ship their raisins to a raisin\n\u201chandler,\u201d who physically separates the raisins due the Government\n(called \u201creserve raisins\u201d), pays the growers only for the remainder\n(\u201cfree-tonnage raisins\u201d), and packs and sells the free-tonnage\nraisins. The Raisin Committee acquires title to the reserve raisins\nthat have been set aside, and decides how to dispose of them in its\ndiscretion. It sells them in noncompetitive markets, for example to\nexporters, federal agencies, or foreign governments; donates them\nto charitable causes; releases them to growers who agree to reduce\ntheir raisin production; or disposes of them by \u201cany other means\u201d\nconsistent with the purposes of the raisin program. 7 CFR\n\u00a7989.67(b)(5) (2015). Proceeds from Committee sales are principally\nused to subsidize handlers who sell raisins for export (not\nincluding the Hornes, who are not raisin exporters). Raisin growers\nretain an interest in any net proceeds from sales the Raisin\nCommittee makes, after deductions for the export subsidies and the\nCommittee\u2019s administrative expenses. In the years at issue in this\ncase, those proceeds were less than the cost of producing the crop\none year, and nothing at all the next.The Hornes\u2014Marvin Horne, Laura Horne, and their\nfamily\u2014are both raisin growers and handlers. They \u201chandled\u201d not\nonly their own raisins but also those produced by other growers,\npaying those growers in full for all of their raisins, not just the\nfree-tonnage portion. In 2002, the Hornes refused to set aside any\nraisins for the Government, believing they were not legally bound\nto do so. The Government sent trucks to the Hornes\u2019 facility at\neight o\u2019clock one morning to pick up the raisins, but the Hornes\nrefused entry. App. 31; cf.post,at 11 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting). The Government then assessed against the Hornes a fine\nequal to the market value of the missing raisins\u2014some $480,000\u2014as\nwell as an additional civil penalty of just over $200,000 for\ndisobeying the order to turn them over.When the Government sought to collect the fine,\nthe Hornes turned to the courts, arguing that the reserve\nrequirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under\nthe Fifth Amendment. Their case eventually made it to this Court\nwhen the Government argued that the lower courts had no\njurisdiction to consider the Hornes\u2019 constitutional defense to the\nfine.Hornev.Department of Agriculture, 569\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2013) (Horne I). We rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s argument and sent the case back to the Court of\nAppeals so it could address the Hornes\u2019 contention on the merits.Id., at ___ (slip op.,at 15).On remand, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the\nHornes that the validity of the fine rose or fell with the\nconstitutionality of the reserve requirement. 750 F.\u00a03d 1128,\n1137 (2014). The court then considered whether that requirement was\na physical appropriation of property, giving rise to aper\u00a0setaking, or a restriction on a raisin grower\u2019s\nuse of his property, properly analyzed under the more flexible and\nforgiving standard for a regulatory taking. The court rejected the\nHornes\u2019 argument that the reserve requirement was aper\u00a0setaking, reasoning that \u201cthe Takings Clause\naffords less protection to personal than to real property,\u201d and\nconcluding that the Hornes \u201care not completely divested of their\nproperty rights,\u201d because growers retain an interest in the\nproceeds from any sale of reserve raisins by the Raisin Committee.Id., at 1139.The court instead viewed the reserve requirement\nas a use restriction, similar to a government condition on the\ngrant of a land use permit. SeeDolanv.City of\nTigard, 512 U.\u00a0S. 374 (1994) ;Nollanv.California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483 U.\u00a0S. 825 (1987) . As in\nsuch permit cases, the Court of Appeals explained, the Government\nhere imposed a condition (the reserve requirement) in exchange for\na Government benefit (an orderly raisin market). And just as a\nlandowner was free to avoid the government condition by forgoing a\npermit, so too the Hornes could avoid the reserve requirement by\n\u201cplanting different crops.\u201d 750 F.\u00a03d, at 1143. Under that\nanalysis, the court found that the reserve requirement was a\nproportional response to the Government\u2019s interest in ensuring an\norderly raisin market, and not a taking under the Fifth\nAmendment.We granted certiorari. 574 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015).IIThe petition for certiorari poses three\nquestions, which we answer in turn.AThe first question presented asks \u201cWhether the\ngovernment\u2019s \u2018categorical duty\u2019 under the Fifth Amendment to pay\njust compensation when it \u2018physically takes possession of an\ninterest in property,\u2019Arkansas Game & Fish Comm\u2019nv.\nUnited States, 133 S.\u00a0Ct. 511, 518 (2012), applies only to\nreal property and not to personal property.\u201d The answer is no.1There is no dispute that the \u201cclassic taking\n[is one] in which the government directly appropriates private\nproperty for its own use.\u201dTahoe-Sierra Preservation\nCouncil,Inc.v.Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,\n535 U.\u00a0S. 302, 324 (2002) (brackets and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Nor is there any dispute that, in the case of real\nproperty, such an appropriation is aper\u00a0setaking that\nrequires just compensation. SeeLorettov.Teleprompter\nManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.\u00a0S. 419 \u2013435 (1982).Nothing in the text or history of the Takings\nClause, or our precedents, suggests that the rule is any different\nwhen it comes to appropriation of personal property. The Government\nhas a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your\ncar, just as when it takes your home.The Takings Clause provides: \u201c[N]or shall\nprivate property be taken for public use, without just\ncompensation.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 5. It protects \u201cprivate\nproperty\u201d without any distinction between different types. The\nprinciple reflected in the Clause goes back at least 800 years to\nMagna Carta, which specifically protected agricultural crops from\nuncompensated takings. Clause 28 of that charter forbade any\n\u201cconstable or other bailiff\u00a0\u201d from taking \u201ccorn or other\nprovisions from any one without immedi-ately tendering money\ntherefor, unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of\nthe seller.\u201d Cl. 28 (1215), in W. McKechnie, Magna Carta, A\nCommentary on the Great Charter of King John 329 (2d ed. 1914).The colonists brought the principles of Magna\nCarta with them to the New World, including that charter\u2019s\nprotection against uncompensated takings of personal property. In\n1641, for example, Massachusetts adopted its Body of Liberties,\nprohibiting \u201cmans Cattel or goods of what kinde soever\u201d from being\n\u201cpressed or taken for any publique use or service, unlesse it be by\nwarrant grounded upon some act of the generall Court, nor without\nsuch reasonable prices and hire as the ordinarie rates of the\nCountrie do afford.\u201d Massachusetts Body of Liberties \u00b68, in R.\nPerry, Sources of Our Liberties 149 (1978). Virginia allowed the\nseizure of surplus \u201clive stock, or beef, pork, or bacon\u201d for the\nmilitary, but only upon \u201cpaying or tendering to the owner the price\nso estimated by the appraisers.\u201d 1777 Va. Acts ch. XII. And South\nCarolina authorized the seizure of \u201cnecessaries\u201d for public use,\nbut provided that \u201csaid articles so seized shall be paid for\nagreeable to the prices such and the like articles sold for on the\nninth day of October last.\u201d 1779 S.\u00a0C. Acts \u00a74.Given that background, it is not surprising that\nearly Americans bridled at appropriations of their personal\nproperty during the Revolutionary War, at the hands of both sides.\nJohn Jay, for example, complained to the New York Legislature about\nmilitary impressment by the Continental Army of \u201cHorses, Teems, and\nCarriages,\u201d and voiced his fear that such action by the \u201clittle\nOfficers\u201d of the Quartermasters Department might extend to\n\u201cBlankets, Shoes, and many other articles.\u201d A Hint to the\nLegislature of the State of New York (1778), in John Jay, The\nMaking of a Revolutionary 461\u2013463 (R. Morris ed. 1975) (emphasis\ndeleted). The legislature took the \u201chint,\u201d passing a law that,\namong other things, provided for compensation for the impressment\nof horses and carriages. 1778 N.\u00a0Y. Laws ch. 29. According to\nthe author of the first treatise on the Constitution, St. George\nTucker, the Takings Clause was \u201cprobably\u201d adopted in response to\n\u201cthe arbitrary and oppressive mode of obtaining supplies for the\narmy, and other public uses, by impressment, as was too frequently\npractised during the revolutionary war, without any compensation\nwhatever.\u201d 1 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Editor\u2019s App. 305\u2013306\n(1803).Nothing in this history suggests that personal\nproperty was any less protected against physical appropriation than\nreal property. As this Court summed up inJamesv.Campbell, 104 U.\u00a0S. 356, 358 (1882) , a case concerning\nthe alleged appropriation of a patent by the Government:\u201c[A patent] confers upon the patentee an\nexclusive property in the patented invention which cannot be\nappropriated or used by the government itself, without just\ncompensation, any more than it can appropriate or use without\ncompensation land which has been patented to a private\npurchaser.\u201dPrior to this Court\u2019s decision inPennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393\n(1922) , the Takings Clause was understood to provide protection\nonly against a direct appropriation of property\u2014personal or real.Pennsylvania Coalexpanded the protection of the Takings\nClause, holding that compensation was also required for a\n\u201cregulatory taking\u201d\u2014a restriction on the use of property that went\n\u201ctoo far.\u201dId., at 415. And inPenn Central Transp.\nCo.v.New York City, 438 U.\u00a0S. 104, 124 (1978) ,\nthe Court clarified that the test for how far was \u201ctoo far\u201d\nrequired an \u201cad\u00a0hoc\u201d factual inquiry. That inquiry required\nconsidering factors such as the economic impact of the regulation,\nits interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations,\nand the character of the government action.Four years afterPenn Central, however,\nthe Court reaffirmed the rule that a physicalappropriationof property gave rise to aper\u00a0setaking, without\nregard to other factors. InLoretto, the Court held that\nrequiring an owner of an apartment building to allow installation\nof a cable box on her rooftop was a physical taking of real\nproperty, for which compensation was required. That was true\nwithout regard to the claimed public benefit or the economic impact\non the owner. The Court explained that such protection was\njustified not only by history, but also because \u201c[s]uch an\nappropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an\nowner\u2019s property interests,\u201d depriving the owner of the \u201cthe rights\nto possess, use and dispose of\u201d the property. 458 U.\u00a0S., at\n435 (internal quotation marks omitted). That reasoning\u2014both with\nrespect to history and logic\u2014is equally applicable to a physical\nappropriation of personal property.The Ninth Circuit based its distinction between\nreal and personal property on this Court\u2019s discussion inLucasv.South Carolina Coastal Council, 505\nU.\u00a0S. 1003 (1992) , a case involving extensive limitations on\nthe use of shorefront property. 750 F.\u00a03d, at 1139\u20131141.Lucasrecognized that while an owner of personal property\n\u201cought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might\neven render his property economically worthless,\u201d such an \u201cimplied\nlimitation\u201d was not reasonable in the case of land. 505 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 1027\u20131028.Lucas, however, was about regulatory\ntakings, not direct appropriations. WhateverLucashad to\nsay about reasonable expectations with regard to regulations,\npeople still do not expect their property, real or personal, to be\nactually occupied or taken away. Our cases have stressed the\n\u201clongstanding distinction\u201d between government acquisitions of\nproperty and regulations.Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council,\n535 U.\u00a0S., at 323. The different treatment of real and\npersonal property in a regulatory case suggested byLucasdid not alter the established rule of treating direct\nappropriations of real and personal property alike. See 535\nU.\u00a0S., at 323.(It is \u201cinappropriate to treat cases\ninvolving physical takings as controlling precedents for the\nevaluation of a claim that there has been a \u2018regulatory taking,\u2019\nand vice versa\u201d (footnote omitted)).2The reserve requirement imposed by the Raisin\nCommittee is a clear physical taking. Actual raisins are\ntransferred from the growers to the Government. Title to the\nraisins passes to the Raisin Committee. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n179a; Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. The Committee\u2019s raisins must be\nphysically segregated from free-tonnage raisins. 7 CFR\n\u00a7989.66(b)(2). Reserve raisins are sometimes left on the premises\nof handlers, but they are held \u201cfor the account\u201d of the Government.\n\u00a7989.66(a). The Committee disposes of what become its raisins as it\nwishes, to promote the purposes of the raisin marketing order.Raisin growers subject to the reserve\nrequirement thus lose the entire \u201cbundle\u201d of property rights in the\nappropriated raisins\u2014\u201cthe rights to possess, use and dispose\nof\u00a0\u201d them,Loretto, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 435 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014with the exception of the speculative hope\nthat some residual proceeds may be left when the Government is done\nwith the raisins and has deducted the expenses of implementing all\naspects of the marketing order. The Government\u2019s \u201cactual taking of\npossession and control\u201d of the reserve raisins gives rise to a\ntaking as clearly \u201cas if the Government held full title and\nownership,\u201did., at 431 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nas it essentially does. The Government\u2019s formal demand that the\nHornes turn over a percentage of their raisin crop without charge,\nfor the Government\u2019s control and use, is \u201cof such a unique\ncharacter that it is a taking without regard to other factors that\na court might ordinarily examine.\u201dId., at 432.The Government thinks it \u201cstrange\u201d and the\ndissent \u201cbaffling\u201d that the Hornes object to the reserve\nrequirement, when they nonetheless concede that \u201cthe government may\nprohibit the sale of raisins without effecting a per\u00a0se\ntaking.\u201d Brief for Respondent 35;post,at 12\n(Sotomayor,\u00a0J., dissenting). But that distinction flows\nnaturally from the settled difference in our takings jurisprudence\nbetween appropriation and regulation. A physical taking of raisins\nand a regulatory limit on production may have the same economic\nimpact on a grower. The Constitution, however, is concerned with\nmeans as well as ends. The Government has broad powers, but the\nmeans it uses to achieve its ends must be \u201cconsist[ent] with the\nletter and spirit of the constitution.\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819). As Justice Holmes noted,\n\u201ca strong public desire to improve the public condition is not\nenough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the\nconstitutional way.\u201dPennsylvania Coal, 260 U.\u00a0S., at\n416.BThe second question presented asks \u201cWhether\nthe government may avoid the categorical duty to pay just\ncompensation for a physical taking of property by reserving to the\nproperty owner a contingent interest in a portion of the value of\nthe property, set at the government\u2019s discretion.\u201d The answer is\nno.The Government and dissent argue that raisins\nare fungible goods whose only value is in the revenue from their\nsale. According to the Government, the raisin marketing order\nleaves that interest with the raisin growers: After selling reserve\nraisins and deducting expenses and subsidies for exporters, the\nRaisin Committee returns any net proceeds to the growers. 7 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7989.67(d), 989.82, 989.53(a), 989.66(h). The Government contends\nthat because growers are entitled to these net proceeds, they\nretain the most important property interest in the reserve raisins,\nso there is no taking in the first place. The dissent agrees,\narguing that this possible future revenue means there has been no\ntaking underLoretto. Seepost,at 2\u20136.But when there has been a physical\nappropriation, \u201cwe do not ask .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether it deprives\nthe owner of all economically valuable use\u201d of the item taken.Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 323;\nseeid., at 322 (\u201cWhen the government physically takes\npossession of an interest in property for some public purpose, it\nhas a categorical duty to compensate the former owner, regardless\nof whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel\nor merely a part thereof.\u201d (citation omitted)). For example, inLoretto, we held that the installation of a cable box on a\nsmall corner of Loretto\u2019s rooftop was aper\u00a0setaking,\neven though she could of course still sell and economically benefit\nfrom the property. 458 U.\u00a0S., at 430, 436. The fact that the\ngrowers retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value does\nnot mean there has been no physical taking, particularly since the\nvalue of the interest depends on the discretion of the taker, and\nmay be worthless, as it was for one of the two years at issue\nhere.The dissent points toAndrusv.Allard, 444 U.\u00a0S. 51 (1979) , noting that the Court\nfound no taking in that case, even though the owners\u2019 artifacts\ncould not be sold at all.Post, at 6. The dissent suggests\nthat the Hornes should be happy, because they might at least getsomethingfrom what had been their raisins. ButAllardis a very different case. As the dissent recognizes,\nthe owners in that case retained the rights to possess, donate, and\ndevise their property. In finding no taking, the Court emphasized\nthat the Government did not \u201ccompel the surrender of the artifacts,\nand there [was] no physical invasion or restraint upon them.\u201d 444\nU.\u00a0S.,at 65\u201366. Here of course the raisin program\nrequires physical surrender of the raisins and transfer of title,\nand the growers lose any right to control their disposition.The Government and dissent again confuse our\ninquiry concerningper\u00a0setakings with our analysis for\nregulatory takings. A regulatory restriction on use that does not\nentirely deprive an owner of property rights may not be a taking\nunderPenn Central. That is why, inPruneYard Shopping\nCenterv.Robins, 447 U.\u00a0S. 74 (1980) , we held\nthat a law limiting a property owner\u2019s right to exclude certain\nspeakers from an already publicly accessible shopping center did\nnot take the owner\u2019s property. The owner retained the value of the\nuse of the property as a shopping center largely unimpaired, so the\nregulation did not go \u201ctoo far.\u201dId., at 83 (quotingPennsylvania Coal Co., 260 U.\u00a0S., at 415). But once\nthere is a taking, as in the case of a physical appropriation, any\npayment from the Government in connection with that action goes, at\nmost, to the question of just compensation. SeeSuitumv.Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.\u00a0S. 725 \u2013748\n(1997) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nThat is not an issue here: The Hornes did not receive any net\nproceeds from Raisin Committee sales for the years at issue,\nbecause they had not set aside any reserve raisins in those years\n(and, in any event, there were no net proceeds in one of them).CThe third question presented asks \u201cWhether a\ngovernmental mandate to relinquish specific, identifiable prop-erty\nas a \u2018condition\u2019 on permission to engage in commerce effects a\nper\u00a0se taking.\u201d The answer, at least in this case, is yes.The Government contends that the reserve\nrequirement is not a taking because raisin growers voluntarily\nchoose to participate in the raisin market. According to the\nGovernment, if raisin growers don\u2019t like it, they can \u201cplant\ndifferent crops,\u201d or \u201csell their raisin-variety grapes as table\ngrapes or for use in juice or wine.\u201d Brief for Respondent 32\n(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\u201cLet them sell wine\u201d is probably not much more\ncomforting to the raisin growers than similar retorts have been to\nothers throughout history. In any event, the Government is wrong as\na matter of law. InLoretto, we rejected the argument that\nthe New York law was not a taking because a landlord could avoid\nthe requirement by ceasing to be a landlord. We held instead that\n\u201ca landlord\u2019s ability to rent his property may not be conditioned\non his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical\noccupation.\u201d 458 U.\u00a0S., at 439, n.\u00a017. As the Court\nexplained, the contrary argument \u201cproves too much\u201d:\u201cFor example, it would allow the\ngovernment to require a landlord to devote a substantial portion of\nhis building to vending and washing machines, with all profits to\nbe retained by the owners of these services and with no\ncompensation for the deprivation of space. It would even allow the\ngovernment to requisition a certain number of apartments as\npermanent government offices.\u201dIbid.As the Court concluded, property rights \u201ccannot\nbe so easily manipulated.\u201dIbid.The Government and dissent rely heavily onRuckelshausv.Monsanto Co., 467 U.\u00a0S. 986\n(1984) . There we held that the Environmental Protection Agency\ncould require companies manufacturing pesticides, fungicides, and\nrodenticides to disclose health, safety, and environmental\ninformation about their products as a condition to receiving a\npermit to sell those products. While such information included\ntrade secrets in which pesticide manufacturers had a property\ninterest, those manufacturers were not subjected to a taking\nbecause they received a \u201cvaluable Government benefit\u201d in exchange\u2014a\nlicense to sell dangerous chemicals.Id.,at 1007; seeNollan, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 834, n.\u00a02 (discussingMonsanto).The taking here cannot reasonably be\ncharacterized as part of a similar voluntary exchange. In one of\nthe years at issue here, the Government insisted that the Hornes\nturn over 47 percent of their raisin crop, in exchange for the\n\u201cbenefit\u201d of being allowed to sell the remaining 53 percent. The\nnext year, the toll was 30 percent. We have already rejected the\nidea thatMonsantomay be extended by regarding basic and\nfamiliar uses of property as a \u201cGovernment benefit\u201d on the same\norder as a permit to sell hazardous chemicals. SeeNollan,\n483 U.\u00a0S., at 834, n. 2 (distinguishingMonsantoon the\nground that \u201cthe right to build on one\u2019s own property\u2014even though\nits exercise can be subjected to legitimate permitting\nrequirements\u2014cannot remotely be described as a \u2018governmental\nbenefit\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Selling produce in interstate commerce, although\ncertainly subject to reasonable government regulation, is similarly\nnot a special governmental benefit that the Government may hold\nhostage, to be ransomed by the waiver of constitutional protection.\nRaisins are not dangerous pesticides; they are a healthy snack. A\ncase about conditioning the sale of hazardous substances on\ndisclosure of health, safety, and environmental information related\nto those hazards is hardly on point.Leonard & Leonardv.Earle,\n279 U.\u00a0S. 392 (1929) , is also readily distinguishable. In\nthat case, the Court upheld a Maryland requirement that oyster\npackers remit ten percent of the marketable detached oyster shells\nor their monetary equivalent to the State for the privilege of\nharvesting the oysters. But the packers did \u201cnot deny the power of\nthe State to declare their business a privilege,\u201d and the power of\nthe State to impose a \u201cprivilege tax\u201d was \u201cnot questioned by\ncounsel.\u201dId., at 396. The oysters, unlike raisins, were\n\u201cfer\u00e6 natur\u00e6\u201d that belonged to the State under state law, and \u201c[n]o\nindividual ha[d] any property rights in them other than such as the\nstate may permit him to acquire.\u201dLeonardv.Earle,\n155 Md. 252, 258, 141 A. 714, 716 (1928). The oyster packers did\nnot simply seek to sell their property; they sought to appropriate\nthe State\u2019s. Indeed, the Maryland Court of Appeals saw the issue as\na question of \u201ca reasonable and fair compensation\u201dfromthe\npackersto\u201cthe state, as owner of the oysters.\u201dId.,\nat 259, 141 A., at 717 (internal quotation marks omitted).Raisins are not like oysters: they are private\nproperty\u2014the fruit of the growers\u2019 labor\u2014not \u201cpublic things subject\nto the absolute control of the state,\u201did., at 258, 141 A.,\nat 716. Any physical taking of them for public use must be\naccompanied by just compensation.IIIThe Government correctly points out that a\ntaking does not violate the Fifth Amendment unless there is no just\ncompensation, and argues that the Hornes are free to seek\ncompensation for any taking by bringing a damages action under the\nTucker Act in the Court of Federal Claims. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71491(a)(1);Monsanto, 467 U.\u00a0S., at\n1020. But we held inHorne Ithat the Hornes may, in their\ncapacity as handlers, raise a takings-based defense to the fine\nlevied against them. We specifically rejected the contention that\nthe Hornes were required to pay the fine and then seek compensation\nunder the Tucker Act. See 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n13\u201314) (\u201cWe .\u00a0.\u00a0. conclude that the [Agricultural\nMarketing Agreement Act] withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over\n[the Hornes\u2019] takings claim. [The Hornes] (as handlers) have no\nalternative remedy, and their takings claim was not \u2018premature\u2019\nwhen presented to the Ninth Circuit.\u201d).As noted, the Hornes are both growers and\nhandlers. Their situation is unusual in that, as handlers, they\nhave the full economic interest in the raisins the Government\nalleges should have been set aside for its account. They own the\nraisins they grew and are handling for themselves, and they own the\nraisins they handle for other growers, having paid those growers\nfor all their raisins (not just the free-tonnage amount, as is true\nwith respect to most handlers). Seesupra, at 2\u20133; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 3\u20134. The penalty assessed against them as handlers\nincluded the dollar equivalent of the raisins they refused to set\naside\u2014their raisins. 750 F.\u00a03d, at 1135, n. 6; Brief for\nPetitioners 15. They may challenge the imposition of that fine, and\ndo not have to pay it first and then resort to the Court of Federal\nClaims.Finally, the Government briefly argues that if\nwe conclude that the reserve requirement effects a taking, we\nshould remand for the Court of Appeals to calculate \u201cwhat\ncompensation would have been due if petitioners had complied with\nthe reserve requirement.\u201d Brief for Respondent 55. The Government\ncontends that the calculation must consider what the value of the\nreserve raisins would have been without the price support program,\nas well as \u201cother benefits .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the regulatory\nprogram, such as higher consumer demand for raisins spurred by\nenforcement of quality standards and promotional activities.\u201dId., at 55\u201356. Indeed, according to the Government, the\nHornes would \u201clikely\u201d have a net gain under this theory.Id., at 56.The best defense may be a good offense, but the\nGovernment cites no support for its hypothetical-based approach, or\nits notion that general regulatory activity such as enforcement of\nquality standards can constitute just compensation for a specific\nphysical taking. Instead, our cases have set forth a clear and\nadministrable rule for just compensation: \u201cThe Court has repeatedly\nheld that just compensation normally is to be measured by \u2018the\nmarket value of the property at the time of the taking.\u2019 \u201dUnited Statesv.50 Acres of Land, 469 U. S. 24, 29\n(1984) (quotingOlsonv.United States, 292 U. S.\n246, 255 (1934) ).Justice Breyer is concerned that applying this\nrule in this case will affect provisions concerning whether a\ncondemning authority may deduct special benefits\u2014such as new access\nto a waterway or highway, or filling in of swampland\u2014from the\namount of compensation it seeks to pay a landowner suffering a\npartial taking.Post, at 5 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part); seeBaumanv.Ross, 167 U. S.\n548 (1897) (laying out of streets and subdivisions in the District\nof Columbia). He need not be. Cases of that sort can raise\ncomplicated questions involving the exercise of the eminent domain\npower, but they do not create a generally applicable exception to\nthe usual compensation rule, based on asserted regulatory benefits\nof the sort at issue here. Nothing in the cases Justice Breyer\nlabels \u201cBaumanand its progeny,\u201dpost,at 5, suggests\notherwise, which may be why the Solicitor General does not cite\nthem.[1]In any event, this litigation presents no\noccasion to consider the broader issues discussed by Justice\nBreyer. The Government has already calculated the amount of just\ncompensation in this case, when it fined the Hornes the fair market\nvalue of the raisins: $483,843.53. 750 F.\u00a03d, at 1135, n. 6.\nThe Government cannot now disavow that valuation, see Reply Brief\n21\u201323, and does not suggest that the marketing order affords the\nHornes compensation in that amount. There is accordingly no need\nfor a remand; the Hornes should simply be relieved of the\nobligation to pay the fine and associated civil penalty they were\nassessed when they resisted the Government\u2019s effort totake their\nraisins. This case, in litigation for more than a decade, has gone\non long enough.The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1For example, inUnited\nStatesv.Miller, 317 U. S. 369, 377 (1943) , the\nCourt\u2014in calculating the fair market value of land\u2014discounted an\nincrease in value resulting from speculation \u201cas to what the\nGovern-ment would be compelled to pay as compensation\u201d after the\nland was earmarked for acquisition. InUnited Statesv.Sponenbarger, 308 U.\u00a0S. 256, 265 (1939) , the Court\ndetermined there was no taking in the first place, when the\ncomplaint was merely that a Government flood control plan provided\ninsufficient protection for the claimant\u2019s land.McCoyv.Union Elevated R. Co., 247 U. S. 354, 363 (1918) , similarly\ninvolved a claim \u201cfor damages to property not actually taken.\u201d So\ntooReichelderferv.Quinn, 287 U.\u00a0S. 315 (1932)\n. There the Court held that claimants who had paid a special\nassessment when Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.\u00a0C., was\ncreated\u2014because the Park increased the value of their property\u2014did\nnot thereby have the right to prevent Congress from altering use of\npart of the Park for a fire station 38 years later. InDohanyv.Rogers, 281 U.\u00a0S. 362 (1930) , the law\nauthorizing the taking did \u201cnot permit the offset of benefits for a\nrailroad,\u201d and therefore was \u201cnot subject to the objection that it\nfails to provide adequate compensation .\u00a0.\u00a0. and is\ntherefore unconstitutional.\u201dId.,at 367, and n.\u00a01\n(quotingFitzsimons & Galvin, Inc.v.Rogers, 243\nMich. 649, 665, 220 N.\u00a0W. 881, 886 (1928)). And inNorwoodv.Baker, 172 U.\u00a0S. 269 (1898) , the\nissue was whether an assessment to pay for improvements exceeded a\nvillage\u2019s taxing power. Perhaps farthest afield are theRegional\nRail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.\u00a0S. 102, 153 (1974) ,\nwhich involved valuation questions arising from the Government\nreorganization of northeast and midwest railroads. The Court in\nthat case held that the legislation at issue was not \u201cmerely an\neminent domain statute\u201d but instead was enacted \u201cpursuant to the\nbankruptcy power.\u201dId.,at 151, 153.",
