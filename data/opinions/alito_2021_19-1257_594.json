Arizona law\ngenerally makes it very easy to vote. All voters may vote by mail\nor in person for nearly a month before election day, but Arizona\nimposes two restrictions that are claimed to be unlawful. First, in\nsome counties, voters who choose to cast a ballot in person on\nelection day must vote in their own precincts or else their ballots\nwill not be counted. Second, mail-in ballots cannot be collected by\nanyone other than an election official, a mail carrier, or a\nvoter\u2019s family member, household member, or caregiver. After a\ntrial, a District Court upheld these rules, as did a panel of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. But an en\nbanc court, by a divided vote, found them to be unlawful. It relied\non the rules\u2019 small disparate impacts on members of minority\ngroups, as well as past discrimination dating back to the State\u2019s\nterritorial days. And it overturned the District Court\u2019s finding\nthat the Arizona Legislature did not adopt the ballot-collection\nrestriction for a discriminatory purpose. We now hold that the en\nbanc court misunderstood and misapplied \u00a72 and that it exceeded its\nauthority in rejecting the District Court\u2019s factual finding on the\nissue of legislative intent.IACongress enacted the landmark Voting Rights\nAct of 1965, 79Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301et\u00a0seq., in an effort to achieve at long last what the\nFifteenth Amendment had sought to bring about 95 years earlier: an\nend to the denial of the right to vote based on race. Ratified in\n1870, the Fifteenth Amendment provides in \u00a71 that \u201c[t]he right of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d Section 2 of the\nAmendment then grants Congress the \u201cpower to enforce [the\nAmendment] by appropriate legislation.\u201dDespite the ratification of the Fifteenth\nAmendment, the right of African-Americans to vote was heavily\nsuppressed for nearly a century. States employed a variety of\nnotorious methods, including poll taxes, literacy tests, property\nqualifications, \u201c\u00a0\u2018white primar[ies],\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018grandfather clause[s].\u2019\u00a0\u201d[1] Challenges to some blatant efforts reached this Court\nand were held to violate the Fifteenth Amendment. See,e.g.,Guinnv.United States,238 U.S.\n347, 360\u2013365 (1915) (grandfather clause);Myersv.Anderson,238 U.S.\n368, 379\u2013380 (1915) (same);Lanev.Wilson,307 U.S.\n268, 275\u2013277 (1939) (registration scheme predicated on\ngrandfather clause);Smithv.Allwright,321 U.S.\n649, 659\u2013666 (1944) (white primaries);Schnellv.Davis, 336 U.S. 933 (1949) (per curiam), affirming81 F. Supp. 872(SD Ala. 1949) (test of constitutional\nknowledge);Gomillionv.Lightfoot,364 U.S.\n339, 347 (1960) (racial gerrymander). But as late as the\nmid-1960s, black registration and voting rates in some States were\nappallingly low. SeeSouth Carolinav.Katzenbach,383\nU.S. 301, 313 (1966).Invoking the power conferred by \u00a72 of the\nFifteenth Amendment, see 383 U.\u00a0S., at 308;City of\nRomev.United States,446 U.S.\n156, 173 (1980), Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act (VRA)\nto address this entrenched problem. The Act and its amendments in\nthe 1970s specifically forbade some of the practices that had been\nused to suppress black voting. See \u00a7\u00a74(a), (c), 79Stat. 438\u2013439;\n\u00a76, 84Stat. 315; \u00a7102, 89Stat. 400, as amended, 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a710303(a), (c), 10501 (prohibiting the denial\nof the right to vote in any election for failure to pass a test\ndemonstrating literacy, educational achievement or knowledge of any\nparticular subject, or good moral character); see also \u00a710, 79Stat.\n442, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710306 (declaring poll taxes\nunlawful); \u00a711, 79Stat. 443, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a710307 (prohibiting intimidation and the refusal to allow or count\nvotes). Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA imposed special requirements\nfor States and subdivisions where violations of the right to vote\nhad been severe. And \u00a72 addressed the denial or abridgment of the\nright to vote in any part of the country.As originally enacted, \u00a72 closely tracked the\nlanguage of the Amendment it was adopted to enforce. Section 2\nstated simply that \u201c[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to\nvoting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of\nrace or color.\u201d 79Stat. 437.Unlike other provisions of the VRA, \u00a72 attracted\nrelatively little attention during the congressional\ndebates[2] and was\n\u201clittle-used\u201d for more than a decade after its passage.[3] But during the same period, this\nCourt considered several cases involving \u201cvote-dilution\u201d claims\nasserted under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. SeeWhitcombv.Chavis,403 U.S.\n124(1971);Burnsv.Richardson,384 U.S.\n73(1966);Fortsonv.Dorsey,379 U.S.\n433(1965). In these and later vote-dilution cases, plaintiffs\nclaimed that features of legislative districting plans, including\nthe configuration of legislative districts and the use of\nmulti-member districts, diluted the ability of particular voters to\naffect the outcome of elections.One Fourteenth Amendment vote-dilution case,Whitev.Regester,412 U.S.\n755(1973), came to have outsized importance in the development\nof our VRA case law. InWhite, the Court affirmed a District\nCourt\u2019s judgment that two multi-member electoral districts were\n\u201cbeing used invidiously to cancel out or minimize the voting\nstrength of racial groups.\u201dId., at 765. The Court explained\nwhat a vote-dilution plaintiff must prove, and the words the Court\nchose would later assume great importance in VRA \u00a72 matters.\nAccording toWhite, a vote-dilution plaintiff had to show\nthat \u201cthe political processes leading to nomination and election\nwere notequally opento participation by the group in\nquestion\u2014that its members hadless opportunitythan did\nother residents in the district to participate in the political\nprocesses and to elect legislators of their choice.\u201dId., at\n766 (emphasis added). The decision then recited many pieces of\nevidence the District Court had taken into account, and it found\nthat this evidence sufficed to prove the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Seeid., at 766\u2013769. The decision inWhitepredatedWashingtonv.Davis,426 U.S.\n229(1976), where the Court held that an equal-protection\nchallenge to a facially neutral rule requires proof of\ndiscriminatory purpose or intent,id., at 238\u2013245, and theWhiteopinion said nothing one way or the other about\npurpose or intent.A few years later, the question whether a VRA \u00a72\nclaim required discriminatory purpose or intent came before this\nCourt inMobilev.Bolden,446 U.S.\n55(1980). The plurality opinion for four Justices concluded\nfirst that \u00a72 of the VRA added nothing to the protections afforded\nby the Fifteenth Amendment.Id., at 60\u201361. The plurality\nthen observed that prior decisions \u201cha[d] made clear that action by\na State that is racially neutral on its face violates the Fifteenth\nAmendment only if motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\u201dId., at 62. The obvious result of those premises was that\nfacially neutral voting practices violate \u00a72 only if motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose. The plurality readWhiteas\nconsistent with this requirement.Bolden, 446 U.\u00a0S., at\n68\u201370.Shortly afterBoldenwas handed down,\nCongress amended \u00a72 of the VRA. The oft-cited Report of the Senate\nJudiciary Committee accompanying the 1982 Amendment stated that the\namendment\u2019s purpose was to repudiateBoldenand establish a\nnew vote-dilution test based on what the Court had said inWhite. See S. Rep. No. 97\u2013417, pp.\u00a02, 15\u201316, 27. The\nbill that was initially passed by the House of Representatives\nincluded what is now \u00a72(a). In place of the phrase \u201cto deny or\nabridge the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote on account of race or\ncolor,\u201d the amendment substituted \u201cin a manner whichresults\nina denial or abridgement of the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote\non account of race or color.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 97\u2013227,\np.\u00a048 (1981) (emphasis added); H. R. 3112, 97th Cong., 1st\nSess., \u00a72, p. 8 (introduced Oct. 7, 1981).The House bill \u201coriginally passed\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. under a loose understanding that \u00a72 would prohibit\nall discriminatory \u2018effects\u2019 of voting practices, and that intent\nwould be \u2018irrelevant,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but \u201c[t]his version met stiff\nresistance in the Senate.\u201dMississippi Republican Executive\nCommitteev.Brooks,469 U.S.\n1002, 1010 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (quoting\nH.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 97\u2013227, at 29). The House and Senate\ncompromised, and the final product included language proposed by\nSenator Dole. 469 U.\u00a0S., at 1010\u20131011; S.\u00a0Rep. No.\n97\u2013417, at 3\u20134; 128 Cong. Rec. 14131\u201314133 (1982) (Sen. Dole\ndescribing his amendment).What is now \u00a72(b) was added, and that provision\nsets out what must be shown to prove a \u00a72 violation. It requires\nconsideration of \u201cthe totality of circumstances\u201d in each case and\ndemands proof that \u201cthe political processes leading to nomination\nor election in the State or political subdivision are notequally opento participation\u201d by members of a protected\nclass \u201cin that its members have less opportunitythan other\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process\nand to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301(b) (emphasis added). Reflecting the\nSenate Judiciary Committee\u2019s stated focus on the issue of vote\ndilution, this language was taken almost verbatim fromWhite.This concentration on the contentious issue of\nvote dilution reflected the results of the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee\u2019s extensive survey of what it regarded as Fifteenth\nAmendment violations that called out for legislative redress. See,e.g., S. Rep. No. 97\u2013417, at 6, 8, 23\u201324, 27, 29. That\nsurvey listed many examples of what the Committee took to be\nunconstitutional vote dilution, but the survey identified only\nthree isolated episodes involving the outright denial of the right\nto vote, and none of these concerned the equal application of a\nfacially neutral rule specifying the time, place, or manner of\nvoting. Seeid., at 30, and n.\u00a0119.[4] These sparse results were presumably good news.\nThey likely showed that the VRA and other efforts had achieved a\nlarge measure of success in combating the previously widespread\npractice of using such rules to hinder minority groups from\nvoting.This Court first construed the amended \u00a72 inThornburgv.Gingles,478 U.S.\n30(1986)\u2014another vote-dilution case. Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion\nfor the Court set out three threshold requirements for proving a \u00a72\nvote-dilution claim, and, taking its cue from the Senate Report,\nprovided a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in\ndetermining whether \u00a72 had been violated.Id., at 44\u201345,\n48\u201351, 80. \u201cThe essence of a \u00a72 claim,\u201d the Court said, \u201cis that a\ncertain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social\nand historical conditions to cause an inequality in the\nopportunities\u201d of minority and non-minority voters to elect their\npreferred representatives.Id., at 47.In the years sinceGingles, we have heard\na steady stream of \u00a72 vote-dilution cases,[5] but until today, we have not considered how \u00a72\napplies to generally applicable time, place, or manner voting\nrules. In recent years, however, such claims have proliferated in\nthe lower courts.[6]BThe present dispute concerns two features of\nArizona voting law, which generally makes it quite easy for\nresidents to vote. All Arizonans may vote by mail for 27 days\nbefore an election using an \u201cearly ballot.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a716\u2013541 (2015), 16\u2013542(C) (Cum. Supp. 2020). No special excuse is\nneeded, \u00a7\u00a716\u2013541(A), 16\u2013542(A), and any voter may ask to be sent an\nearly ballot automatically in future elections, \u00a716\u2013544(A) (2015).\nIn addition, during the 27 days before an election, Arizonans may\nvote in person at an early voting location in each county. See\n\u00a7\u00a716\u2013542(A), (E). And they may also vote in person on election\nday.Each county is free to conduct election-day\nvoting either by using the traditional precinct model or by setting\nup \u201cvoting centers.\u201d \u00a716\u2013411(B)(4) (Cum. Supp. 2020). Voting\ncenters are equipped to provide all voters in a county with the\nappropriate ballot for the precinct in which they are registered,\nand this allows voters in the county to use whichever vote center\nthey prefer. Seeibid.The regulations at issue in this suit govern\nprecinct-based election-day voting and early mail-in voting. Voters\nwho choose to vote in person on election day in a county that uses\nthe precinct system must vote in their assigned precincts. See\n\u00a716\u2013122 (2015); see also \u00a716\u2013135. If a voter goes to the wrong\npolling place, poll workers are trained to direct the voter to the\nright location.Democratic Nat. Comm.v.Reagan, 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 824, 859 (Ariz. 2018); see Tr. 1559, 1586 (Oct.\n12, 2017); Tr. Exh. 370 (Pima County Elections Inspectors\nHandbook). If a voter finds that his or her name does not appear on\nthe register at what the voter believes is the right precinct, the\nvoter ordinarily may cast a provisional ballot. Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013584 (Cum. Supp. 2020). That ballot is later counted if the\nvoter\u2019s address is determined to be within the precinct. Seeibid.But if it turns out that the voter cast a ballot at\nthe wrong precinct, that vote is not counted. See \u00a716\u2013584(E); App.\n37\u201341 (election procedures manual); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a716\u2013452(C) (misdemeanor to violate rules in election procedures\nmanual).For those who choose to vote early by mail,\nArizona has long required that \u201c[o]nly the elector may be in\npossession of that elector\u2019s unvoted early ballot.\u201d \u00a716\u2013542(D). In\n2016, the state legislature enacted House Bill 2023 (HB 2023),\nwhich makes it a crime for any person other than a postal worker,\nan elections official, or a voter\u2019s caregiver, family member, or\nhousehold member to knowingly collect an early ballot\u2014either before\nor after it has been completed. \u00a7\u00a716\u20131005(H)\u2013(I).In 2016, the Democratic National Committee and\ncertain affiliates brought this suit and named as defendants (among\nothers) the Arizona attorney general and secretary of state in\ntheir official capacities. Among other things, the plaintiffs\nclaimed that both the State\u2019s refusal to count ballots cast in the\nwrong precinct and its ballot-collection restriction \u201cadversely and\ndisparately affect Arizona\u2019s American Indian, Hispanic, and African\nAmerican citizens,\u201d in violation of \u00a72 of the VRA.Democratic\nNat. Comm.v.Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989, 998 (CA9 2020) (en\nbanc). In addition, they alleged that the ballot-collection\nrestriction was \u201cenacted with discriminatory intent\u201d and thus\nviolated both \u00a72 of the VRA and the Fifteenth Amendment.Ibid.After a 10-day bench trial, 329 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 832, 833\u2013838, the District Court made extensive findings of\nfact and rejected all the plaintiffs\u2019 claims,id., at\n838\u2013883. The court first found that the out-of-precinct policy \u201chas\nno meaningfully disparate impact on the opportunities of minority\nvoters to elect\u201d representatives of their choice.Id., at\n872. The percentage of ballots invalidated under this policy was\nvery small (0.15% of all ballots cast in 2016) and decreasing, and\nwhile the percentages were slightly higher for members of minority\ngroups, the court found that this disparity \u201cdoes not result in\nminorities having unequal access to the political process.\u201dIbid.The court also found that the plaintiffs had not\nproved that the policy \u201ccauses minorities to show up to vote at the\nwrong precinct at rates higher than their non-minority\ncounterparts,\u201did., at 873, and the court noted that the\nplaintiffs had not even challenged \u201cthe manner in which Arizona\ncounties allocate and assign polling places or Arizona\u2019s\nrequirement that voters re-register to vote when they move,\u201dibid.The District Court similarly found that the\nballot- collection restriction is unlikely to \u201ccause a meaningful\ninequality in the electoral opportunities of minorities.\u201dId., at 871. Rather, the court noted, the restriction\napplies equally to all voters and \u201cdoes not impose burdens beyond\nthose traditionally associated with voting.\u201dIbid.The court\nobserved that the plaintiffs had presented no records showing how\nmany voters had previously relied on now-prohibited third-party\nballot collectors and that the plaintiffs also had \u201cprovided no\nquantitative or statistical evidence\u201d of the percentage of minority\nand non-minority voters in this group.Id., at 866. \u201c[T]he\nvast majority\u201d of early voters, the court found, \u201cdo not return\ntheir ballots with the assistance of a [now-prohibited] third-party\ncollector,\u201did., at 845, and the evidence largely showed\nthat those who had used such collectors in the past \u201cha[d] done so\nout of convenience or personal preference, or because of\ncircumstances that Arizona law adequately accommodates in other\nways,\u201did., at 847.[7]\nIn addition, the court noted, none of the individual voters called\nby the plaintiffs had even claimed that the ballot-collection\nrestriction \u201cwould make it significantly more difficult to vote.\u201dId., at 871.Finally, the court found that the\nballot-collection law had not been enacted with discriminatory\nintent. \u201c[T]he majority of H.B. 2023\u2019s proponents,\u201d the court\nfound, \u201cwere sincere in their belief that ballot collection\nincreased the risk of early voting fraud, and that H.B. 2023 was a\nnecessary prophylactic measure to bring early mail ballot security\nin line with in-person voting.\u201dId., at 879. The court added\nthat \u201csome individual legislators and proponents were motivated in\npart by partisan interests.\u201dId.,at 882. But it\ndistinguished between partisan and racial motives, while\nrecognizing that \u201cracially polarized voting can sometimes blur the\nlines.\u201dIbid.A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed,\nbut an en banc court reversed. The en banc court first concluded\nthat both the out-of-precinct policy and the ballot-collection\nrestriction imposed disparate burdens on minority voters because\nsuch voters were more likely to be adversely affected by those\nrules. 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1014\u20131016, 1032\u20131033. Then, based on an\nassessment of the vote-dilution factors used inGingles, the\nen banc majority found that these disparate burdens were \u201cin part\ncaused by or linked to \u2018social and historical conditions\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthat produce inequality. 948 F. 3d, at 1032 (quotingGingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 47); see 948 F.\u00a03d, at\n1037. Among other things, the court relied on racial discrimination\ndating back to Arizona\u2019s territorial days, current socioeconomic\ndisparities, racially polarized voting, and racial campaign\nappeals. Seeid., at 1016\u20131032, 1033\u20131037.The en banc majority also held that the District\nCourt had committed clear error in finding that the\nballot-collection law was not enacted with discriminatory intent.\nThe en banc court did not claim that a majority of legislators had\nvoted for the law for a discriminatory purpose, but the court held\nthat these lawmakers \u201cwere used as \u2018cat\u2019s paws\u2019\u00a0\u201d by others.Id., at 1041.One judge in the majority declined to join the\ncourt\u2019s holding on discriminatory intent, and four others dissented\nacross the board. A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed by\nthe Arizona attorney general on his own behalf and on behalf of the\nState, which had intervened below; another petition was filed by\nthe Arizona Republican Party and other private parties who also had\nintervened. We granted the petitions and agreed to review both the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s understanding and application of VRA \u00a72 and its\nholding on discriminatory intent. 591 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IIWe begin with two preliminary matters.\nSecretary of State Hobbs contends that no petitioner has Article\nIII standing to appeal the decision below as to the out-of-precinct\npolicy, but we reject that argument. All that is needed to\nentertain an appeal of that issue is one party with standing, seeLittle Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Homev.Pennsylvania, 591 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a06 (2020)\n(slip op., at 13, n.\u00a06), and we are satisfied that Attorney\nGeneral Brnovich fits the bill. The State of Arizona intervened\nbelow, see App. 834; there is \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d as an Article III matter\nthat \u201cthe State itself c[an] press this appeal,\u201dVirginia House\nof Delegatesv.Bethune-Hill, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 4); and the attorney general is authorized to\nrepresent the State in any action in federal court, Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a741\u2013193(A)(3) (2021); seeArizonans for Official\nEnglishv.Arizona,520 U.S.\n43, 51, n.\u00a04 (1997).Second, we think it prudent to make clear at the\nbeginning that we decline in these cases to announce a test to\ngovern all VRA \u00a72 claims involving rules, like those at issue here,\nthat specify the time, place, or manner for casting ballots. Each\nof the parties advocated a different test, as did manyamiciand the courts below. In a brief filed in December in support of\npetitioners, the Department of Justice proposed one such test but\nlater disavowed the analysis in that brief.[8] The Department informed us, however, that it did not\ndisagree with its prior conclusion that the two provisions of\nArizona law at issue in these cases do not violate \u00a72 of the Voting\nRights Act.[9] All told, no\nfewer than 10 tests have been proposed. But as this is our first\nforay into the area, we think it sufficient for present purposes to\nidentify certain guideposts that lead us to our decision in these\ncases.IIIAWe start with the text of VRA \u00a72. It now\nprovides:\u201c(a) No voting qualification or prerequisite\nto voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which\nresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color, or in\ncontravention of the guarantees set forth in section\n10303(f\u00a0)(2) of this title, as provided in subsection (b).\u201c(b) A violation of subsection (a) is\nestablished if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown\nthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in\nthe State or political subdivision are not equally open to\nparticipation by members of a class of citizens protected by\nsubsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process\nand to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which\nmembers of a protected class have been elected to office in the\nState or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be\nconsidered:Provided, That nothing in this section\nestablishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in\nnumbers equal to their proportion in the population.\u201d 52\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301.InGingles, our seminal \u00a72 vote-dilution\ncase, the Court quoted the text of amended \u00a72 and then jumped right\nto the Senate Judiciary Committee Report, which focused on the\nissue of vote dilution. 478 U.\u00a0S., at 36\u201337, 43, and\nn.\u00a07. Our many subsequent vote-dilution cases have largely\nfollowed the path thatGinglescharted. But because this is\nour first \u00a72 time, place, or manner case, a fresh look at the\nstatutory text is appropriate. Today, our statutory interpretation\ncases almost always start with a careful consideration of the text,\nand there is no reason to do otherwise here.BSection 2(a), as noted, omits the phrase \u201cto\ndeny or abridge the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote on account of\nrace or color,\u201d which theBoldenplurality had interpreted\nto require proof of discriminatory intent. In place of that\nlanguage, \u00a72(a) substitutes the phrase \u201cin a manner whichresults ina denial or abridgement of the right\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote on account of race or color.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) We need not decide what this text would mean if it stood\nalone because \u00a72(b), which was added to win Senate approval,\nexplains what must be shown to establish a \u00a72 violation. Section\n2(b) states that \u00a72 is violated only where \u201cthe political processes\nleading to nomination or election\u201d are not \u201cequally opento\nparticipation\u201d by members of the relevant protected group \u201cin\nthat its members have less opportunitythan other members of\nthe electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)The key requirement is that the political\nprocesses leading to nomination and election (here, the process of\nvoting) must be \u201cequally open\u201d to minority and non-minority groups\nalike, and the most relevant definition of the term \u201copen,\u201d as used\nin \u00a72(b), is \u201cwithout restrictions as to who may participate,\u201d\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1008 (J. Stein ed.\n1966), or \u201crequiring no special status, identification, or permit\nfor entry or participation,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 1579 (1976).What \u00a72(b) means by voting that is not \u201cequally\nopen\u201d is further explained by this language: \u201cin that its members\nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives\nof their choice.\u201d The phrase \u201cin that\u201d is \u201cused to specify the\nrespect in which a statement is true.\u201d[10] Thus, equal openness and equal opportunity are not\nseparate requirements. Instead, equal opportunity helps to explain\nthe meaning of equal openness. And the term \u201copportunity\u201d means,\namong other things, \u201ca combination of circumstances, time, and\nplace suitable or favorable for a particular activity or action.\u201dId., at 1583; see also Random House Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language, at 1010 (\u201can appropriate or favorable time or\noccasion,\u201d \u201ca situation or condition favorable for attainment of a\ngoal\u201d).Putting these terms together, it appears that\nthe core of \u00a72(b) is the requirement that voting be \u201cequally open.\u201d\nThe statute\u2019s reference to equal \u201copportunity\u201d may stretch that\nconcept to some degree to include consideration of a person\u2019s\nability tousethe means that are equally open. But equal\nopenness remains the touchstone.COne other important feature of \u00a72(b) stands\nout. The provision requires consideration of \u201cthe totality of\ncircumstances.\u201d Thus, any circumstance that has a logical bearing\non whether voting is \u201cequally open\u201d and affords equal \u201copportunity\u201d\nmay be considered. We will not attempt to compile an exhaustive\nlist, but several important circumstances should be mentioned.11. First, the size of the burden imposed by a\nchallenged voting rule is highly relevant. The concepts of\n\u201copen[ness]\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d connote the absence of obstacles and\nburdens that block or seriously hinder voting, and therefore the\nsize of the burden imposed by a voting rule is important. After\nall, every voting rule imposes a burden of some sort. Voting takes\ntime and, for almost everyone, some travel, even if only to a\nnearby mailbox. Casting a vote, whether by following the directions\nfor using a voting machine or completing a paper ballot, requires\ncompliance with certain rules. But because voting necessarily\nrequires some effort and compliance with some rules, the concept of\na voting system that is \u201cequally open\u201d and that furnishes an equal\n\u201copportunity\u201d to cast a ballot must tolerate the \u201cusual burdens of\nvoting.\u201dCrawfordv.Marion County Election Bd.,553 U.S.\n181, 198 (2008) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Mere inconvenience\ncannot be enough to demonstrate a violation of \u00a72.[11]2. For similar reasons, the degree to which a\nvoting rule departs from what was standard practice when \u00a72 was\namended in 1982 is a relevant consideration. Because every voting\nrule imposes a burden of some sort, it is useful to have benchmarks\nwith which the burdens imposed by a challenged rule can be\ncompared. The burdens associated with the rules in widespread use\nwhen \u00a72 was adopted are therefore useful in gauging whether the\nburdens imposed by a challenged rule are sufficient to prevent\nvoting from being equally \u201copen\u201d or furnishing an equal\n\u201copportunity\u201d to vote in the sense meant by \u00a72. Therefore, it is\nrelevant that in 1982 States typically required nearly all voters\nto cast their ballots in person on election day and allowed only\nnarrow and tightly defined categories of voters to cast absentee\nballots. See,e.g., 17 N.\u00a0Y. Elec. Law Ann. \u00a78\u2013100et\u00a0seq.(West 1978), \u00a78\u2013300et\u00a0seq.(in-person voting), \u00a78\u2013400et\u00a0seq.(limited-excuse\nabsentee voting); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \u00a73045et\u00a0seq.(Purdon 1963) (in-person voting), \u00a73149.1et\u00a0seq.(limited-excuse absentee voting); see \u00a73146.1\n(Purdon Cum. Supp. 1993) (same); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a73501.02et\u00a0seq.(Lexis 1972) (in-person voting), \u00a73509.01et\u00a0seq.(limited-excuse absentee voting); see \u00a73509.02\n(Lexis Supp. 1986) (same); Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7101.011et\u00a0seq.(1973) (in-person voting), \u00a7101.62et\u00a0seq.(limited-excuse absentee voting); see \u00a797.063\n(1982) (same); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch.46, \u00a717\u20131et\u00a0seq.(West 1977) (in-person voting), \u00a719\u20131et\u00a0seq.(limited-excuse absentee voting); D.\u00a0C. Code \u00a7\u00a71\u20131109, 1\u20131110\n(1973) (in-person voting and limited-excuse absentee voting); see\n\u00a71\u20131313 (1981) (same). As of January 1980, only three States\npermitted no-excuse absentee voting. See Gronke &\nGalanes-Rosenbaum, America Votes! 261, 267\u2013269 (B. Griffith ed.\n2008); see also J. Sargent et\u00a0al., Congressional Research\nService, The Growth of Early and Nonprecinct Place Balloting, in\nElection Laws of the Fifty States and the District of Columbia\n(rev. 1976). We doubt that Congress intended to uproot facially\nneutral time, place, and manner regulations that have a long\npedigree or are in widespread use in the United States. We have no\nneed to decide whether adherence to, or a return to, a 1982\nframework is necessarily lawful under \u00a72, but the degree to which a\nchallenged rule has a long pedigree or is in widespread use in the\nUnited States is a circumstance that must be taken into\naccount.3. The size of any disparities in a rule\u2019s\nimpact on members of different racial or ethnic groups is also an\nimportant factor to consider. Small disparities are less likely\nthan large ones to indicate that a system is not equally open. To\nthe extent that minority and non-minority groups differ with\nrespect to employment, wealth, and education, even neutral\nregulations, no matter how crafted, may well result in some\npredictable disparities in rates of voting and noncompliance with\nvoting rules. But the mere fact there is some disparity in impact\ndoes not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that\nit does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote. The size of\nany disparity matters. And in assessing the size of any disparity,\na meaningful comparison is essential. What are at bottom very small\ndifferences should not be artificially magnified.E.g.,Frankv.Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 752, n.\u00a03 (CA7\n2014).4. Next, courts must consider the opportunities\nprovided by a State\u2019s entire system of voting when assessing the\nburden imposed by a challenged provision. This follows from \u00a72(b)\u2019s\nreference to the collective concept of a State\u2019s \u201cpolitical\nprocesses\u201d and its \u201cpolitical process\u201d as a whole. Thus, where a\nState provides multiple ways to vote, any burden imposed on voters\nwho choose one of the available options cannot be evaluated without\nalso taking into account the other available means.5. Finally, the strength of the state interests\nserved by a challenged voting rule is also an important factor that\nmust be taken into account. As noted, every voting rule imposes a\nburden of some sort, and therefore, in determining \u201cbased on the\ntotality of circumstances\u201d whether a rule goes too far, it is\nimportant to consider the reason for the rule. Rules that are\nsupported by strong state interests are less likely to violate\n\u00a72.One strong and entirely legitimate state\ninterest is the prevention of fraud. Fraud can affect the outcome\nof a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of\ncitizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight. Fraud can\nalso undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and\nthe perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.Ensuring that every vote is cast freely, without\nintimidation or undue influence, is also a valid and important\nstate interest. This interest helped to spur the adoption of what\nsoon became standard practice in this country and in other\ndemocratic nations the world round: the use of private voting\nbooths. SeeBursonv.Freeman,504 U.S.\n191, 202\u2013205 (1992) (plurality opinion).2While the factors set out above are important,\nothers considered by some lower courts are less helpful in a case\nlike the ones at hand. First, it is important to keep in mind that\ntheGinglesor \u201cSenate\u201d factors grew out of and were\ndesigned for use in vote-dilution cases. Some of those factors are\nplainly inapplicable in a case involving a challenge to a facially\nneutral time, place, or manner voting rule. Factors three and four\nconcern districting and election procedures like \u201cmajority vote\nrequirements,\u201d \u201canti-single shot provisions,\u201d[12] and a \u201ccandidate slating process.\u201d[13] SeeGingles, 478\nU.\u00a0S., at 37 (internal quotation marks omitted). Factors two,\nsix, and seven (which concern racially polarized voting, racially\ntinged campaign appeals, and the election of minority-group\ncandidates),ibid., have a bearing on whether a districting\nplan affects the opportunity of minority voters to elect their\ncandidates of choice. But in cases involving neutral time, place,\nand manner rules, the only relevance of these and the remaining\nfactors is to show that minority group members suffered\ndiscrimination in the past (factor one) and that effects of that\ndiscrimination persist (factor five).Id.,at 36\u201337. We do\nnot suggest that these factors should be disregarded. After all,\n\u00a72(b) requires consideration of \u201cthe totality of circumstances.\u201d\nBut their relevance is much less direct.We also do not find the disparate-impact model\nemployed in Title VII and Fair Housing Act cases useful here. The\ntext of the relevant provisions of Title VII and the Fair Housing\nAct differ from that of VRA \u00a72, and it is not obvious why Congress\nwould conform rules regulating voting to those regulating\nemployment and housing. For example, we think it inappropriate to\nread \u00a72 to impose a strict \u201cnecessity requirement\u201d that would force\nStates to demonstrate that their legitimate interests can be\naccomplished only by means of the voting regulations in question.\nStephanopoulos, Disparate Impact, Unified Law, 128 Yale L.\u00a0J.\n1566, 1617\u20131619 (2019) (advocating such a requirement). Demanding\nsuch a tight fit would have the effect of invalidating a great many\nneutral voting regulations with long pedigrees that are reasonable\nmeans of pursuing legitimate interests. It would also transfer much\nof the authority to regulate election procedures from the States to\nthe federal courts. For those reasons, the Title VII and Fair\nHousing Act models are unhelpful in \u00a72 cases.DThe interpretation set out above follows\ndirectly from what \u00a72 commands: consideration of \u201cthe totality of\ncircumstances\u201d that have a bearing on whether a State makes voting\n\u201cequally open\u201d to all and gives everyone an equal \u201copportunity\u201d to\nvote. The dissent, by contrast, would rewrite the text of \u00a72 and\nmake it turn almost entirely on just one circumstance\u2014disparate\nimpact.That is a radical project, and the dissent\nstrains mightily to obscure its objective. To that end, it spends\n20 pages discussing matters that have little bearing on the\nquestions before us. The dissent provides historical background\nthat all Americans should remember, seepost, at 3\u20137\n(opinion of Kagan, J.), but that background does not tell us how to\ndecide these cases. The dissent quarrels with the decision inShelby Countyv.Holder,570\nU.S. 529(2013), seepost, at 7\u20139, which concerned \u00a7\u00a74\nand 5 of the VRA, not \u00a72. It discusses all sorts of voting rules\nthat are not at issue here. Seepost, at 9\u201312. And it dwells\non points of law that nobody disputes: that \u00a72 applies to a broad\nrange of voting rules, practices, and procedures; that an\n\u201cabridgement\u201d of the right to vote under \u00a72 does not require\noutright denial of the right; that \u00a72 does not demand proof of\ndiscriminatory purpose; and that a \u201cfacially neutral\u201d law or\npractice may violate that provision. Seepost,at 12\u201320.Only after this extended effort at misdirection\nis the dissent\u2019s aim finally unveiled: to undo as much as possible\nthe compromise that was reached between the House and Senate when\n\u00a72 was amended in 1982. Recall that the version originally passed\nby the House did not contain \u00a72(b) and was thought to prohibit any\nvoting practice that had \u201cdiscriminatory effects,\u201d loosely defined.\nSeesupra, at 5\u20136. That is the freewheeling disparate-impact\nregime the dissent wants to impose on the States. But the version\nenacted into law includes \u00a72(b), and that subsection directs us to\nconsider \u201cthe totality of circumstances,\u201d not, as the dissent would\nhave it, the totality of just one circumstance.[14] There is nothing to the dissent\u2019s\ncharge that we are departing from the statutory text by identifying\nsome of those considerations.We have listed five relevant circumstances and\nhave explained why they all stem from the statutory text and have a\nbearing on the determination that \u00a72 requires. The dissent does not\nmention a single additional consideration, and it does its best to\npush aside all but one of the circumstances we discuss. It entirely\nrejects three of them: the size of the burden imposed by a\nchallenged rule, seepost, at 22\u201323, the landscape of voting\nrules both in 1982 and in the present,post,at\n24\u201325,[15] and the\navailability of other ways to vote,post,at 23\u201324. Unable\nto bring itself to completely reject consideration of the state\ninterests that a challenged rule serves, the dissent tries to\ndiminish the significance of this circumstance as much as possible.\nSeepost,at 26\u201329. According to the dissent, an interest\nserved by a voting rule, no matter how compelling, cannot support\nthe rule unless a State can prove to the satisfaction of the courts\nthat this interest could not be served by any other means.Post, at 17\u201318, 26\u201329. Such a requirement has no footing in\nthe text of \u00a72 or our precedent construing it.[16]That requirement also would have the potential\nto invalidate just about any voting rule a State adopts. Take the\nexample of a State\u2019s interest in preventing voting fraud. Even if a\nState could point to a history of serious voting fraud within its\nown borders, the dissent would apparently strike down a rule\ndesigned to prevent fraud unless the State could demonstrate an\ninability to combat voting fraud in any other way, such as by\nhiring more investigators and prosecutors, prioritizing voting\nfraud investigations, and heightening criminal penalties. Nothing\nabout equal openness and equal opportunity dictates such a high bar\nfor States to pursue their legitimate interests.With all other circumstances swept away, all\nthat remains in the dissent\u2019s approach is the size of any disparity\nin a rule\u2019s impact on members of protected groups. As we have\nnoted, differences in employment, wealth, and education may make it\nvirtually impossible for a State to devise rules that do not have\nsome disparate impact. But under the dissent\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a72, any \u201cstatistically significant\u201d disparity\u2014whereverthatis in the statute\u2014may be enough to take down even facially neutral\nvoting rules with long pedigrees that reasonably pursue important\nstate interests.Post, at 15, n.\u00a04, 19\u201320,\n32\u201333.[17]Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides\nvital protection against discriminatory voting rules, and no one\nsuggests that discrimination in voting has been extirpated or that\nthe threat has been eliminated. But \u00a72 does not deprive the States\nof their authority to establish non-discriminatory voting rules,\nand that is precisely what the dissent\u2019s radical interpretation\nwould mean in practice. The dissent is correct that the Voting\nRights Act exemplifies our country\u2019s commitment to democracy, but\nthere is nothing democratic about the dissent\u2019s attempt to bring\nabout a wholesale transfer of the authority to set voting rules\nfrom the States to the federal courts.IVAIn light of the principles set out above,\nneither Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct rule nor its ballot-collection\nlaw violates \u00a72 of the VRA. Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct rule enforces\nthe requirement that voters who choose to vote in person on\nelection day must do so in their assigned precincts. Having to\nidentify one\u2019s own polling place and then travel there to vote does\nnot exceed the \u201cusual burdens of voting.\u201dCrawford, 553\nU.\u00a0S., at 198 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (noting the same about\nmaking a trip to the department of motor vehicles). On the\ncontrary, these tasks are quintessential examples of the usual\nburdens of voting.Not only are these unremarkable burdens, but the\nDistrict Court\u2019s uncontested findings show that the State made\nextensive efforts to reduce their impact on the number of valid\nvotes ultimately cast. The State makes accurate precinct\ninformation available to all voters. When precincts or polling\nplaces are altered between elections, each registered voter is sent\na notice showing the voter\u2019s new polling place. 329 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 859. Arizona law also mandates that election officials send\na sample ballot to each household that includes a registered voter\nwho has not opted to be placed on the permanent early voter list,\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013510(C) (2015), and this mailing also\nidentifies the voter\u2019s proper polling location, 329 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 859. In addition, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office\nsends voters pamphlets that include information (in both English\nand Spanish) about how to identify their assigned precinct.Ibid.Polling place information is also made available\nby other means. The secretary of state\u2019s office operates websites\nthat provide voter-specific polling place information and allow\nvoters to make inquiries to the secretary\u2019s staff.Ibid.\nArizona\u2019s two most populous counties, Maricopa and Pima, provide\nonline polling place locators with information available in English\nand Spanish.Ibid.Other groups offer similar online tools.Ibid.Voters may also identify their assigned polling place\nby calling the office of their respective county recorder.Ibid.And on election day, poll workers in at least some\ncounties are trained to redirect voters who arrive at the wrong\nprecinct.Ibid; see Tr. 1559, 1586; Tr. Exh. 370 (Pima\nCounty Elections Inspectors Handbook).The burdens of identifying and traveling to\none\u2019s assigned precinct are also modest when considering Arizona\u2019s\n\u201cpolitical processes\u201d as a whole. The Court of Appeals noted that\nArizona leads other States in the rate of votes rejected on the\nground that they were cast in the wrong precinct, and the court\nattributed this to frequent changes in polling locations, confusing\nplacement of polling places, and high levels of residential\nmobility. 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1000\u20131004. But even if it is\nmarginally harder for Arizona voters to find their assigned polling\nplaces, the State offers other easy ways to vote. Any voter can\nrequest an early ballot without excuse. Any voter can ask to be\nplaced on the permanent early voter list so that an early ballot\nwill be mailed automatically. Voters may drop off their early\nballots at any polling place, even one to which they are not\nassigned. And for nearly a month before election day, any voter can\nvote in person at an early voting location in his or her county.\nThe availability of those options likely explains why\nout-of-precinct votes on election day make up such a small and\napparently diminishing portion of overall ballots cast\u20140.47% of all\nballots in the 2012 general election and just 0.15% in 2016. 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 872.Next, the racial disparity in burdens allegedly\ncaused by the out-of-precinct policy is small in absolute terms.\nThe District Court accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that, of the\nArizona counties that reported out-of-precinct ballots in the 2016\ngeneral election, a little over 1% of Hispanic voters, 1% of\nAfrican-American voters, and 1% of Native American voters who voted\non election day cast an out-of-precinct ballot.Ibid.For\nnon-minority voters, the rate was around 0.5%.Ibid. (citing\nTr. Exh. 97, at 3, 20\u201321). A policy that appears to work for 98% or\nmore of voters to whom it applies\u2014minority and non-minority\nalike\u2014is unlikely to render a system unequally open.The Court of Appeals attempted to paint a\ndifferent picture, but its use of statistics was highly misleading\nfor reasons that were well explained by Judge Easterbrook in a \u00a72\ncase involving voter IDs. As he put it, a distorted picture can be\ncreated by dividing one percentage by another.Frank, 768\nF.\u00a03d, at 752, n.\u00a03. He gave this example: \u201cIf 99.9% of\nwhites had photo IDs, and 99.7% of blacks did,\u201d it could be said\nthat \u201c\u00a0\u2018blacks are three times as likely as whites to lack\nqualifying ID\u2019 (0.3 \u00f7 0.1 = 3), but such a statement would mask the\nfact that the populations were effectively identical.\u201dIbid.That is exactly what the en banc Ninth Circuit\ndid here. The District Court found that among the counties that\nreported out-of-precinct ballots in the 2016 general election,\nroughly 99% of Hispanic voters, 99% of African-American voters, and\n99% of Native American voters who voted on election day cast their\nballots in the right precinct, while roughly 99.5% of non-minority\nvoters did so. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 872. Based on these\nstatistics, the en banc Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cminority\nvoters in Arizona cast [out-of-precinct] ballots at twice the rate\nof white voters.\u201d 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1014; seeid., at\n1004\u20131005. This is precisely the sort of statistical manipulation\nthat Judge Easterbrook rightly criticized, namely, 1.0 \u00f7 0.5 = 2.\nProperly understood, the statistics show only a small disparity\nthat provides little support for concluding that Arizona\u2019s\npolitical processes are not equally open.The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision also failed to\ngive appropriate weight to the state interests that the\nout-of-precinct rule serves. Not counting out-of-precinct votes\ninduces compliance with the requirement that Arizonans who choose\nto vote in-person on election day do so at their assigned polling\nplaces. And as the District Court recognized, precinct-based voting\nfurthers important state interests. It helps to distribute voters\nmore evenly among polling places and thus reduces wait times. It\ncan put polling places closer to voter residences than would a more\ncentralized voting-center model. In addition, precinct-based voting\nhelps to ensure that each voter receives a ballot that lists only\nthe candidates and public questions on which he or she can vote,\nand this orderly administration tends to decrease voter confusion\nand increase voter confidence in elections. See 329 F.\u00a0Supp.\n3d, at 878. It is also significant that precinct-based voting has a\nlong pedigree in the United States. See 948 F.\u00a03d, at\n1062\u20131063 (Bybee, J., dissenting) (citing J. Harris, Election\nAdministration in the United States 206\u2013207 (1934)). And the policy\nof not counting out-of-precinct ballots is widespread. See 948\nF.\u00a03d, at 1072\u20131088 (collecting and categorizing state\nlaws).The Court of Appeals discounted the State\u2019s\ninterests because, in its view, there was no evidence that a less\nrestrictive alternative would threaten the integrity of\nprecinct-based voting. The court thought the State had no good\nreason for not counting an out-of-precinct voter\u2019s choices with\nrespect to the candidates and issues also on the ballot in the\nvoter\u2019s proper precinct. Seeid., at 1030\u20131031. We disagree\nwith this reasoning.Section 2 does not require a State to show that\nits chosen policy is absolutely necessary or that a less\nrestrictive means would not adequately serve the State\u2019s\nobjectives. And the Court of Appeals\u2019 preferred alternative would\nhave obvious disadvantages. Partially counting out-of-precinct\nballots would complicate the process of tabulation and could lead\nto disputes and delay. In addition, as one of the en banc\ndissenters noted, it would tend to encourage voters who are\nprimarily interested in only national or state-wide elections to\nvote in whichever place is most convenient even if they know that\nit is not their assigned polling place. Seeid., at\n1065\u20131066 (opinion of Bybee, J.).In light of the modest burdens allegedly imposed\nby Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy, the small size of its\ndisparate impact, and the State\u2019s justifications, we conclude the\nrule does not violate \u00a72 of the VRA.[18]BHB 2023 likewise passes muster under the\nresults test of \u00a72. Arizonans who receive early ballots can submit\nthem by going to a mailbox, a post office, an early ballot drop\nbox, or an authorized election official\u2019s office within the 27-day\nearly voting period. They can also drop off their ballots at any\npolling place or voting center on election day, and in order to do\nso, they can skip the line of voters waiting to vote in person. 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 839 (citing ECF Doc. 361, \u00b657). Making any of\nthese trips\u2014much like traveling to an assigned polling place\u2014falls\nsquarely within the heartland of the \u201cusual burdens of voting.\u201dCrawford, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 198 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\nAnd voters can also ask a statutorily authorized proxy\u2014a family\nmember, a household member, or a caregiver\u2014to mail a ballot or drop\nit off at any time within 27 days of an election.Arizona also makes special provision for certain\ngroups of voters who are unable to use the early voting system.\nEvery county must establish a special election board to serve\nvoters who are \u201cconfined as the result of a continuing illness or\nphysical disability,\u201d are unable to go to the polls on election\nday, and do not wish to cast an early vote by mail. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013549(C) (Cum. Supp. 2020). At the request of a voter\nin this group, the board will deliver a ballot in person and return\nit on the voter\u2019s behalf. \u00a7\u00a716\u2013549(C), (E). Arizona law also\nrequires employers to give employees time off to vote when they are\notherwise scheduled to work certain shifts on election day. \u00a716\u2013402\n(2015).The plaintiffs were unable to provide\nstatistical evidence showing that HB 2023 had a disparate impact on\nminority voters. Instead, they called witnesses who testified that\nthird-party ballot collection tends to be used most heavily in\ndisadvantaged communities and that minorities in Arizona\u2014especially\nNative Americans\u2014are disproportionately disadvantaged. 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 868, 870. But from that evidence the District\nCourt could conclude only that prior to HB 2023\u2019s enactment,\n\u201cminorities generically were more likely than non-minorities to\nreturn their early ballots with the assistance of third parties.\u201dId., at 870. How much more, the court could not say from the\nrecord.Ibid.Neither can we. And without more concrete\nevidence, we cannot conclude that HB 2023 results in less\nopportunity to participate in the political process.[19]Even if the plaintiffs had shown a disparate\nburden caused by HB 2023, the State\u2019s justifications would suffice\nto avoid \u00a72 liability. \u201cA State indisputably has a compelling\ninterest in preserving the integrity of its election process.\u201dPurcellv.Gonzalez,549 U.S.\n1, 4 (2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Limiting the classes of persons who may handle early\nballots to those less likely to have ulterior motives deters\npotential fraud and improves voter confidence. That was the view of\nthe bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform chaired by\nformer President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James\nBaker. The Carter-Baker Commission noted that \u201c[a]bsentee balloting\nis vulnerable to abuse in several ways: .\u00a0.\u00a0. Citizens\nwho vote at home, at nursing homes, at the workplace, or in church\nare more susceptible to pressure, overt and subtle, or to\nintimidation.\u201d Report of the Comm\u2019n on Fed. Election Reform,\nBuilding Confidence in U.\u00a0S. Elections 46 (Sept. 2005).The Commission warned that \u201c[v]ote buying\nschemes are far more difficult to detect when citizens vote by\nmail,\u201d and it recommended that \u201cStates therefore should reduce the\nrisks of fraud and abuse in absentee voting by prohibiting\n\u2018third-party\u2019 organizations, candidates, and political party\nactivists from handling absentee ballots.\u201dIbid.The\nCommission ultimately recommended that States limit the classes of\npersons who may handle absentee ballots to \u201cthe voter, an\nacknowledged family member, the U.\u00a0S. Postal Service or other\nlegitimate shipper, or election officials.\u201dId., at 47. HB\n2023 is even more permissive in that it also authorizes\nballot-handling by a voter\u2019s household member and caregiver. See\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u20131005(I)(2). Restrictions on ballot\ncollection are also common in other States. See 948 F.\u00a03d, at\n1068\u20131069, 1088\u20131143 (Bybee, J., dissenting) (collecting state\nprovisions).The Court of Appeals thought that the State\u2019s\njustifications for HB 2023 were tenuous in large part because there\nwas no evidence that fraud in connection with early ballots had\noccurred in Arizona. Seeid., at 1045\u20131046. But prevention\nof fraud is not the only legitimate interest served by restrictions\non ballot collection. As the Carter-Baker Commission recognized,\nthird-party ballot collection can lead to pressure and\nintimidation. And it should go without saying that a State may take\naction to prevent election fraud without waiting for it to occur\nand be detected within its own borders. Section 2\u2019s command that\nthe political processes remain equally open surely does not demand\nthat \u201ca State\u2019s political system sustain some level of damage\nbefore the legislature [can] take corrective action.\u201dMunrov.Socialist Workers Party,479 U.S.\n189, 195 (1986). Fraud is a real risk that accompanies mail-in\nvoting even if Arizona had the good fortune to avoid it. Election\nfraud has had serious consequences in other States. For example,\nthe North Carolina Board of Elections invalidated the results of a\n2018 race for a seat in the House of Representatives for evidence\nof fraudulent mail-in ballots.[20] The Arizona Legislature was not obligated to wait for\nsomething similar to happen closer to home.[21]As with the out-of-precinct policy, the modest\nevidence of racially disparate burdens caused by HB 2023, in light\nof the State\u2019s justifications, leads us to the conclusion that the\nlaw does not violate \u00a72 of the VRA.VWe also granted certiorari to review whether\nthe Court of Appeals erred in concluding that HB 2023 was enacted\nwith a discriminatory purpose. The District Court found that it was\nnot, 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 882, and appellate review of that\nconclusion is for clear error,Pullman-Standardv.Swint,456 U.S.\n273, 287\u2013288 (1982). If the district court\u2019s view of the\nevidence is plausible in light of the entire record, an appellate\ncourt may not reverse even if it is convinced that it would have\nweighed the evidence differently in the first instance.Andersonv.Bessemer City,470\nU.S. 564, 573\u2013574 (1985). \u201cWhere there are two permissible\nviews of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot\nbe clearly erroneous.\u201dId., at 574.The District Court\u2019s finding on the question of\ndiscriminatory intent had ample support in the record. Applying the\nfamiliar approach outlined inArlington Heightsv.Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,429 U.S.\n252, 266\u2013268 (1977), the District Court considered the\nhistorical background and the sequence of events leading to HB\n2023\u2019s enactment; it looked for any departures from the normal\nlegislative process; it considered relevant legislative history;\nand it weighed the law\u2019s impact on different racial groups. See 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 879.The court noted, among other things, that HB\n2023\u2019s enactment followed increased use of ballot collection as a\nDemocratic get-out-the-vote strategy and came \u201con the heels of\nseveral prior efforts to restrict ballot collection, some of which\nwere spearheaded by former Arizona State Senator Don Shooter.\u201dId., at 879. Shooter\u2019s own election in 2010 had been close\nand racially polarized. Aiming in part to frustrate the Democratic\nParty\u2019s get-out-the-vote strategy, Shooter made what the court\ntermed \u201cunfounded and often far-fetched allegations of ballot\ncollection fraud.\u201dId., at 880. But what came after the\nairing of Shooter\u2019s claims and a \u201cracially-tinged\u201d video created by\na private party was a serious legislative debate on the wisdom of\nearly mail-in voting.Ibid.[22]That debate, the District Court concluded, was\nsincere and led to the passage of HB 2023 in 2016. Proponents of\nthe bill repeatedly argued that mail-in ballots are more\nsusceptible to fraud than in-person voting.Ibid.The bill\nfound support from a few minority officials and organizations, one\nof which expressed concern that ballot collectors were taking\nadvantage of elderly Latino voters.Ibid.And while some\nopponents of the bill accused Republican legislators of harboring\nracially discriminatory motives, that view was not uniform. Seeibid. One Democratic state senator pithily described the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018problem\u2019\u00a0\u201d HB 2023 aimed to \u201c\u00a0\u2018solv[e]\u2019\u00a0\u201d as\nthe fact that \u201c\u00a0\u2018one party is better at collecting ballots\nthan the other one.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 882 (quoting Tr. Exh.\n25, at 35).We are more than satisfied that the District\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of the evidence is permissible. The spark\nfor the debate over mail-in voting may well have been provided by\none Senator\u2019s enflamed partisanship, but partisan motives are not\nthe same as racial motives. SeeCooperv.Harris, 581\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2017) (slip op., at 19\u201320). The District\nCourt noted that the voting preferences of members of a racial\ngroup may make the former look like the latter, but it carefully\ndistinguished between the two. See 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 879,\n882. And while the District Court recognized that the\n\u201cracially-tinged\u201d video helped spur the debate about ballot\ncollection, it found no evidence that the legislature as a whole\nwas imbued with racial motives.Id.,at 879\u2013880.The Court of Appeals did not dispute the\nDistrict Court\u2019s assessment of the sincerity of HB 2023\u2019s\nproponents. It even agreed that some members of the legislature had\na \u201csincere, though mistaken, non-race-based belief that there had\nbeen fraud in third-party ballot collection, and that the problem\nneeded to be addressed.\u201d 948 F.\u00a03d, at 1040. The Court of\nAppeals nevertheless concluded that the District Court committed\nclear error by failing to apply a \u201c\u00a0\u2018cat\u2019s paw\u2019\u00a0\u201d theory\nsometimes used in employment discrimination cases.Id.,at\n1040\u20131041. A \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d is a \u201cdupe\u201d who is \u201cused by another to\naccomplish his purposes.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n425 (2d ed. 1934). A plaintiff in a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d case typically\nseeks to hold the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s employer liable for \u201cthe animus\nof a supervisor who was not charged with making the ultimate\n[adverse] employment decision.\u201dStaubv.Proctor\nHospital,562 U.S.\n411, 415 (2011).The \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory has no application to\nlegislative bodies. The theory rests on the agency relationship\nthat exists between an employer and a supervisor, but the\nlegislators who vote to adopt a bill are not the agents of the\nbill\u2019s sponsor or proponents. Under our form of government,\nlegislators have a duty to exercise their judgment and to represent\ntheir constituents. It is insulting to suggest that they are mere\ndupes or tools.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy and HB 2023\ndo not violate \u00a72 of the VRA, and HB 2023 was not enacted with a\nracially discriminatory purpose. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1H.\u00a0R.\u00a0Rep.

For example,\nsuppose that an exhibit at a museum in a particular city is open to\neveryone free of charge every day of the week for several months.\nSome residents of the city who have the opportunity to view the\nexhibit may find it inconvenient to do so for many reasons\u2014the\nproblem of finding parking, dislike of public transportation,\nanticipation that the exhibit will be crowded, a plethora of\nweekend chores and obligations, etc. Or, to take another example, a\ncollege course may be open to all students and all may have the\nopportunity to enroll, but some students may find it inconvenient\nto take the class for a variety of reasons. For example, classes\nmay occur too early in the morning or on Friday afternoon; too much\nreading may be assigned; the professor may have a reputation as a\nhard grader; etc.12Where\nvoters are allowed to vote for multiple candidates in a race for\nmultiple seats, single-shot voting is the practice of voting for\nonly one candidate. \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0\u201cSingle-shot voting enables a\nminority group to win some at-large seats if it concentrates its\nvote behind a limited number of candidates and if the vote of the\nmajority is divided among a number of candidates.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dGingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 38\u201339, n.\u00a05 (quotingCity of Romev.United States,446 U.S.\n156, 184, n.\u00a019 (1980)); see also United States Commission\non Civil Rights, The Voting Rights Act: Ten Years After 206\u2013207\n(1975).13Slating has been described as \u201ca\nprocess in which some influential non-governmental organization\nselects and endorses a group or \u2018slate\u2019 of candidates, rendering\nthe election little more than a stamp of approval for the\ncandidates selected.\u201dWestwego Citizens for Better Govt.v.Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1116, n.\u00a05 (CA5 1991).\nExclusion from such a system can make it difficult for minority\ngroups to elect their preferred candidates. See,e.g.,Whitev.Regester,412 U.S.\n755, 766\u2013767, and n.\u00a011 (1973) (describing one\nexample).14The\ndissent erroneously claims that the Senate-House compromise was\nonly about proportional representation and not about \u201cthe\nequal-access right\u201d at issue in the present cases.Post, at\n19, n.\u00a06. The text of the bill initially passed by the House\nhad no equal-access right. See H.\u00a0R. Rep.

Section 2(b) was the Senate\u2019s creation,\nand that provision is what directed courts to look beyond mere\n\u201cresults\u201d to whether a State\u2019s \u201cpolitical processes\u201d are \u201cequally\nopen,\u201d considering \u201cthe totality of circumstances.\u201d SeeMississippi Republican Executive Committeev.Brooks,469 U.S.\n1002, 1010 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe compromise\nbill retained the \u2018results\u2019 language but also incorporated language\ndirectly from this Court\u2019s opinion inWhitev.Regester\u201d). And while the proviso on proportional\nrepresentation may not apply as directly in this suit, it is still\na signal that \u00a72 imposes something other than a pure\ndisparate-impact regime.15The\ndissent objects to consideration of the 1982 landscape because even\nrules that were prevalent at that time are invalid under \u00a72 if\nthey, well, violate \u00a72.Post,at 24. We of course agree with\nthat tautology. But the question is what itmeansto provide\nequal opportunity, and given that every voting rule imposes some\namount of burden, rules that were and are commonplace are useful\ncomparators when considering the totality of circumstances. Unlike\nthe dissent, Congress did not set its sights on every facially\nneutral time, place, or manner voting rule in existence. See,e.g.,S. Rep. No. 97\u2013417, at 10, n.\u00a022 (describing what\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee viewed as \u201cblatant direct\nimpediments to voting\u201d).16For\nsupport, the dissent offers a baseless reading of one of our\nvote-dilution decisions. InHouston Lawyers\u2019 Assn.,501 U.S.\n419, we considered a \u00a72 challenge to an electoral scheme\nwherein all trial judges in a judicial district were elected on a\ndistrict-wide basis.Id.,at 422. The State asserted that it\nhad a strong interest in district-wide judicial elections on the\ntheory that they make every individual judge at least partly\naccountable to minority voters in the jurisdiction.Id.,at\n424, 426. That unique interest, the State contended, should have\n\u201cautomatically\u201d exempted the electoral scheme from \u00a72 scrutiny\naltogether.Id.,at 426. We disagreed, holding that the\nState\u2019s interest was instead \u201ca legitimate factor to be considered\nby courts among the \u2018totality of circumstances\u2019 in determining\nwhether a \u00a72 violation has occurred.\u201dIbid.To illustrate\nwhy an \u201cautomati[c]\u201d exemption from \u00a72\u2019s coverage was\ninappropriate, the Court hypothesized a case involving an \u201cuncouth\u201d\ndistrict shaped like the one inGomillionv.Lightfoot,364 U.S.\n339, 340 (1960), for which an inquiry under \u00a72 \u201cwould at least\narguably be required.\u201d 501 U.\u00a0S., at 427. The Court then wrote\nthe language upon which the dissent seizes: \u201cPlacing elections for\nsingle-member offices entirely beyond the scope of coverage of \u00a72\nwould preclude such an inquiry, even if the State\u2019s interest in\nmaintaining the \u2018uncouth\u2019 electoral system was trivial or illusory\nand even if any resulting impairment of a minority group\u2019s voting\nstrength could be remedied without significantly impairing the\nState\u2019s interest in electing judges on a district-wide basis.\u201dId.,at 427\u2013428. Thatreductio ad absurdum, used to\ndemonstrate only why an automatic exemption from \u00a72 scrutiny was\ninappropriate, did not announce an \u201cinquiry\u201d at all\u2014much less the\nleast-burdensome-means requirement the dissent would have us\nsmuggle in from materially different statutory regimes.Post, at 18, n.\u00a05, 26. Perhaps that is whyno\none\u2014not the parties, not the United States, not the 36 otheramici, not the courts below, and certainly not this Court in\nsubsequent decisions\u2014has advanced the dissent\u2019s surprising reading\nof a single phrase inHouston Lawyers Assn. The dissent\napparently thinks that in 1991 we silently abrogated the principle\nthat the nature of a State\u2019s interest is but one of many factors to\nconsider, seeThornburgv.Gingles,478 U.S.\n30, 44\u201345 (1986), and that our subsequent cases have erred by\nfailing simply to ask whether a less burdensome measure would\nsuffice. Who knew?17We do\nnot think \u00a72 is so procrustean. Statistical significance may\nprovide \u201cevidence that something besides random error is at work,\u201d\nFederal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence\n252 (3d ed. 2011), but it does not necessarily determine causes,\nand as the dissent acknowledges,post,at 15, n.\u00a04, it\nis not the be-all and end-all of disparate-impact analysis. See\nFederal Judicial Center, Reference Manual, at 252 (\u201c[S]ignificant\ndifferences\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are not evidence that [what is at\nwork] is legally or practically important.

When practical significance is lacking\u2014when the size of\na disparity is negligible\u2014there is no reason to worry about\nstatistical significance\u201d);ibid., n.\u00a0102 (citing\nauthorities). Moreover, whatever might be \u201cstandard\u201d in other\ncontexts,post,at 15, n.\u00a04, we have explained that VRA\n\u00a72\u2019s focus on equal \u201copen[ness]\u201d and equal \u201copportunity\u201d does not\nimpose a standard disparate-impact regime.18In\narguing that Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy violates \u00a72, the\ndissent focuses on the State\u2019s decisions about the siting of\npolling places and the frequency with which voting precincts are\nchanged. Seepost, at 33 (\u201cMuch of the story has to do with\nthe siting and shifting of polling places\u201d). But the plaintiffs did\nnot challenge those practices. See 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 873\n(\u201cPlaintiffs .\u00a0.\u00a0. do not challenge the manner in which\nArizona counties allocate and assign polling places or Arizona\u2019s\nrequirement that voters re-register to vote when they move\u201d). The\ndissent is thus left with the unenviable task of explaining how\nsomething like a 0.5% disparity in discarded ballots between\nminority and non-minority groups suffices to render Arizona\u2019s\npolitical processes not equally open to participation. Seesupra,at 27\u201328. A voting rule with that effect would not\nbe\u2014to use the dissent\u2019s florid example\u2014one that a \u201cminority vote\nsuppressor in Arizona\u201d would want in his or her \u201cbag of tricks.\u201dPost, at 33.19Not\none to let the absence of a key finding get in the way, the dissent\nconcludes from its own review of the evidence that HB 2023\n\u201cprevents many Native Americans from making effective use of one of\nthe principal means of voting in Arizona,\u201d and that \u201c[w]hat is an\ninconsequential burden for others is for these citizens a severe\nhardship.\u201dPost, at 38. What is missing from those\nstatements is any evidence about the actual size of the disparity.\n(For that matter, by the time the dissent gets around to assessing\nHB 2023, it appears to have lost its zeal for statistical\nsignificance, which is nowhere to be seen. Seepost, at\n35\u201340, and n.\u00a013.) The reader will search in vain to discover\nwhere the District Court \u201cfound\u201d to what extent HB 2023 would make\nit \u201c\u00a0\u2018significantly more difficult\u2019\u00a0\u201d for Native\nAmericans to vote.Post,at 39, n.\u00a015 (citing 329\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 868, 870). Rather, \u201c[b]ased on\u201d the very same\nevidence the dissent cites, the District Court could find only that\nminorities were \u201cgenerically\u201d more likely than non-minorities to\nmake use of third-party ballot-collection.Id.,at 870. The\nDistrict Court\u2019s explanation as to why speaks for itself: \u201cAlthough\nthere are significant socioeconomic disparities between minorities\nand non-minorities in Arizona, these disparities are an imprecise\nproxy for disparities in ballot collection use. Plaintiffs do not\nargue that all or even most socioeconomically disadvantaged voters\nuse ballot collection services, nor does the evidence support such\na finding. Rather, the anecdotal estimates from individual ballot\ncollectors indicate that a relatively small number of voters have\nused ballot collection services in past elections.\u201dIbid.;\nsee alsoid.,at 881 (\u201c[B]allot collection was used as a\n[get-out-the-vote] strategy in mostly low-efficacy minority\ncommunities, though the Court cannot say how often voters used\nballot collection,nor can it measure the degree or significance\nof any disparities in its usage\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).20See\nBlinder, Election Fraud in North Carolina Leads to New Charges for\nRepublican Operative, N.\u00a0Y.

The dissent notes\nthat many of these voters do not receive mail delivery at home,\nthat the nearest post office may be some distance from their homes,\nand that they may not have automobiles.Post,at 36. We do\nnot dismiss these problems, but for a number of reasons, they do\nnot provide a basis for invalidating HB 2023. The burdens that fall\non remote communities are mitigated by the long period of time\nprior to an election during which a vote may be cast either in\nperson or by mail and by the legality of having a ballot picked up\nand mailed by family or household members. And in this suit, no\nindividual voter testified that HB 2023 would make it significantly\nmore difficult for him or her to vote. 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n871. Moreover, the Postal Service is required by law to \u201cprovide a\nmaximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural\nareas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not\nself-sustaining.\u201d 39 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(b); see also\n\u00a7403(b)(3). Small post offices may not be closed \u201csolely for\noperating at a deficit,\u201d \u00a7101(b), and any decision to close or\nconsolidate a post office may be appealed to the Postal Regulatory\nCommission, see \u00a7404(d)(5). An alleged failure by the Postal\nService to comply with its statutory obligations in a particular\nlocation does not in itself provide a ground for overturning a\nvoting rule that applies throughout an entire State.22The\nDistrict Court also noted prior attempts on the part of the Arizona\nLegislature to regulate or limit third-party ballot collection in\n2011 and 2013. It reasonably concluded that any procedural\nirregularities in those attempts had less probative value for\ninferring the purpose behind HB 2023 because the bills were passed\n\u201cduring different legislative sessions by a substantially different\ncomposition of legislators.\u201d 329 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at\n881.",
