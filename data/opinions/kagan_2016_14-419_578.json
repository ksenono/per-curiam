It is one thing\nto hold, as this Court did inCaplin & Drysdale,\nCharteredv.United States, 491 U.\u00a0S. 617 (1989) ,\nthat a convicted felon has no Sixth Amendment right to pay his\nlawyer with funds adjudged forfeitable. Following conviction, such\nassets belong to the Government, and \u201c[t]here is no constitutional\nprinciple that gives one person the right to give another\u2019s\nproperty to a third party.\u201dId.,at 628. But it is quite\nanother thing to say that the Government may, prior to trial,\nfreeze assets that a defendant needs to hire an attorney, based on\nnothing more than \u201cprobable cause to believe that the property will\nultimately be proved forfeitable.\u201dMonsanto, 491 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 615. At that time, \u201cthe presumption of innocence still applies,\u201d\nand the Government\u2019s interest in the assets is wholly contingent on\nfuture judgments of conviction and forfeiture.Kaleyv.United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n6). I am not altogether convinced that, in this decidedly different\ncircumstance, the Government\u2019s interest in recovering the proceeds\nof crime ought to trump the defendant\u2019s (often highly\nconsequential) right to retain counsel of choice.But the correctness ofMonsantois not at\nissue today. Petitioner Sila Luis has not asked this Court either\nto overrule or to modify that decision; she argues only that it\ndoes not answer the question presented here. And because Luis takesMonsantoas a given, the Court must do so as well.On that basis, I agree with the principal\ndissent thatMonsantocontrols this case. Seeante,at 5\u20137 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Because the Government has\nestablished probable cause to believe that it will eventually\nrecover Luis\u2019s assets, she has no right to use them to pay an\nattorney. SeeMonsanto, 491 U.\u00a0S., at 616 (\u201c[N]o\nconstitutional violation occurs when, after probable cause is\nadequately established, the Government obtains an order barring a\ndefendant from .\u00a0.\u00a0. dissipating his assets prior to\ntrial\u201d).The plurality reaches a contrary result only by\ndifferentiating between the direct fruits of criminal activity and\nsubstitute assets that become subject to forfeiture when the\ndefendant has run through those proceeds. Seeante,at 5\u20136.\nBut as the principal dissent shows, the Government\u2019s and the\ndefendant\u2019s respective legal interests in those two kinds of\nproperty, prior to a judgment of guilt, are exactly the same: The\ndefendant maintains ownership of either type, with the Government\nholding only a contingent interest. Seeante,at 7\u201310.\nIndeed, the plurality\u2019s use of the word \u201ctainted,\u201d to describe\nassets at the pre-conviction stage, makes an unwarranted assumption\nabout the defendant\u2019s guilt. Seeante,at 5 (characterizing\nsuch assets as, for example, \u201crobber\u2019s loot\u201d). Because the\nGovernment has not yet shown that the defendant committed the crime\ncharged, it also has not shown that allegedly tainted assets are\nactually so.And given that money is fungible, the\nplurality\u2019s approach leads to utterly arbitrary distinctions as\namong criminal defendants who are in fact guilty. Seeante,\nat 12 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). The thief who immediately\ndissipates his ill-gotten gains and thereby preserves his other\nassets is no more deserving of chosen counsel than the one who\nspends those two pots of money in reverse order. Yet the plurality\nwould enable only the first defendant, and not the second, to hire\nthe lawyer he wants. I cannot believe the Sixth Amendment draws\nthat irrational line, much as I sympathize with the plurality\u2019s\neffort to cabinMonsanto. Accordingly, I would affirm the\njudgment below.",
