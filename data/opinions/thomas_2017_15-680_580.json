The three-judge\nDistrict Court rejected their challenge, holding that race was not\nthe legislature\u2019s predominant motive in drawing 11 of the districts\nand that the remaining district survives strict scrutiny. I would\nreverse the District Court as to all 12 districts. I therefore\nconcur in the judgment in part and dissent in part.II concur in the Court\u2019s judgment reversing the District Court\u2019s\ndecision to uphold 11 of the 12 districts at issue in this\ncase\u2014House Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and\n95. I do not agree, however, with the Court\u2019s decision to leave\nopen the question whether race predominated in those districts and,\nthus, whether they are subject to strict scrutiny.Ante,at\n12\u201313. Appellees (hereinafter State) concede that the legislature\nintentionally drew all 12 districts as majority-black districts.\nSee,e.g.,Brief for Appellees 1 (\u201c[T]he legislature sought\nto achieve a [black voting-age population] of at least 55% in\nadjusting the lines of the 12 majority-minority districts\u201d). That\nconcession, in my view, mandates strict scrutiny as to each\ndistrict. SeeBushv.Vera,517 U.\u00a0S. 952,1000\n(1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (A State\u2019s \u201cconcession\nthat it intentionally created majority-minority districts [i]s\nsufficient to show that race was a predominant, motivating factor\nin its redistricting\u201d);League of United Latin American\nCitizensv.Perry,548 U.\u00a0S. 399,517 (2006)\n(LULAC) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (\u201c[W]hen a legislature intentionally creates a\nmajority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant\nmotivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered\u201d). I would\ntherefore hold that the District Court must apply strict scrutiny\nto Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and 95 on\nremand.III disagree with the Court\u2019s judgment with respect to the\nremaining district, District 75. The majority affirms the District\nCourt\u2019s holding that District 75 is subject to strict scrutiny.\nWith this I agree, because, as with the other 11 districts, the\nState conceded that it intentionally drew District 75 as a\nmajority-black district.I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s determination that\nDistrict 75 satisfies strict scrutiny. This Court has held that a\nState may draw distinctions among its citizens based on race only\nwhen it \u201cis pursuing a compelling state interest\u201d and has chosen\n\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d means to accomplish that interest.Shawv.Hunt,517 U.\u00a0S. 899,908 (1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The State asserts that it used race in drawing\nDistrict 75 to further a \u201ccompelling interest in complying with\nSection 5 of the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].\u201d Brief for Appellees\n50.[1] And it argues that, based on its\n\u201cgood-faith functional analysis\u201d of the district, it narrowly\ntailored its use of race to achieve that interest.Id.,at\n56. In my view, the State has neither asserted a compelling state\ninterest nor narrowly tailored its use of race.AAs an initial matter, the majority errs by \u201cassum[ing], without\ndeciding, that the State\u2019s interest in complying with the Voting\nRights Act was compelling.\u201dAnte,at 13. To be sure, this\nCourt has previously assumed that a State has a compelling interest\nin complying with the Voting Rights Act. But it has done so only in\ncases in which it has not upheld the redistricting plan at issue.\nSee,e.g.,Millerv.Johnson,515 U.\u00a0S.\n900,921 (1995) (leaving open the question \u201c[w]hether or not in some\ncases compliance with the [Voting Rights] Act, standing alone, can\nprovide a compelling interest independent of any interest in\nremedying past discrimination\u201d).[2] This Court\nhas never, before today, assumed a compelling state interest while\nupholding a state redistricting plan. Indeed, I know of no other\ncase, in any context, in which the Court has assumed away part of\nthe State\u2019s burden to justify its intentional use of race. This\nshould not be the first. I would hold that complying with \u00a75 of the\nVoting Rights Act is not a compelling interest.\u201c[C]ompliance with federal antidiscrimination laws cannot\njustify race-based districting where the challenged district was\nnot reasonably necessary under aconstitutionalreading and\napplication of those laws.\u201dId., at 921 (emphasis added).\nMore than a decade ago, I joined Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion inLULAC, which noted that this Court had \u201cupheld the\nconstitutionality of \u00a75 as a proper exercise of Congress\u2019s\nauthority under \u00a72 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition on the denial or abridgment of the right to\nvote.\u201d 548 U.\u00a0S., at 518. I therefore agreed that, \u201c[i]n the\nproper case, .\u00a0.\u00a0. a covered jurisdiction may have a\ncompelling interest in complying with \u00a75.\u201dId., at 519.I have since concluded that \u00a75 is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201dNorthwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. Onev.Holder,557 U.\u00a0S. 193,216 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part). \u201c[T]he violence,\nintimidation, and subterfuge that led Congress to pass \u00a75 and this\nCourt to uphold it no longer remains,\u201did.,at 229, so \u00a75\n\u201ccan no longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for\nenforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment,\u201did., at 216.Because, in my view, \u00a75 is unconstitutional, I would hold that a\nState does not have a compelling interest in complying with it.BEven if compliance with \u00a75 were a compelling interest, the State\nfailed to narrowly tailor its use of race to further that\ninterest.1This Court has explained that \u201c[a]ny preference based on racial\nor ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching\nexamination.\u201dWygantv.Jackson Bd. of Ed.,476\nU.\u00a0S. 267,273 (1986) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); accord,Adarand Constructors, Inc.v.Pe\u00f1a,515 U.\u00a0S. 200,223 (1995);Grutterv.Bollinger,539 U.\u00a0S. 306,378 (2003) (Rehnquist,\nC.\u00a0J., dissenting). This exacting scrutiny makes sense because\n\u201c[d]iscrimination on the basis of race\u201d is \u201codious in all aspects.\u201dRosev.Mitchell,443 U.\u00a0S. 545,555 (1979).\nAccordingly, a State\u2019s use of race must bear \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most exact\nconnection\u2019\u00a0\u201d to the compelling state interest.Wygant,supra,at 280 (opinion of Powell, J.). In the context of\nredistricting, the redistricting map must, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d actually\n\u201cremedy the anticipated violation\u201d or \u201cachieve compliance\u201d with the\nVoting Rights Act.Shaw, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 916.I have serious doubts about the Court\u2019s standard for narrow\ntailoring, as characterized today and inAlabamaLegislative Black Caucusv.Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S.\n___ (2015). Relying onAlabama, the majority explains that\nnarrow tailoring in the redistricting context requires \u201conly that\nthe legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the\n(race-based) choice that it has made.\u201dAnte,at 14 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That standard \u201cdoes not demand that a\nState\u2019s actions actually be necessary to achieve a compelling state\ninterest in order to be constitutionally valid.\u201dAlabama,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see alsoante,at 14. Instead, under that\nstandard, a state legislature needs only \u201cgood reasonsto\nbelieve\u201d that the use of race is required, even if the use of race\nis not \u201cactually .\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary.\u201dAlabama,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).That approach to narrow tailoring\u2014deferring to a State\u2019s belief\nthat it has good reasons to use race\u2014is \u201cstrict\u201d in name only. To\nthe extent the Court appliesAlabamato dilute the\nwell-settled standard established by our precedents, I demur.2Applying the proper narrow-tailoring standard for state\nclassifications based on race, I conclude that the State did not\nnarrowly tailor its use of race to comply with \u00a75. As the majority\nrecognizes, \u00a75 requires a state redistricting plan to maintain the\nblack population\u2019s ability to elect the candidate of its choice in\nthe district at issue\u2014in other words, the State must \u201cavoid\nretrogression\u201d in the new district.Ante,at 14.The majority observes that the redistricting plan\u2019s architect,\nDelegate Chris Jones, performed a \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d in deciding\nthat District 75 required a 55% black voting-age population\u2014as\nopposed to some other percentage\u2014to avoid retrogression.Ibid.The Court notes that, in arriving at the 55%\nthreshold, Delegate Jones considered turnout rates, the results of\nthe primary and general elections in 2005, and the district\u2019s\n\u201clarge population of disenfranchised black prisoners.\u201dAnte,at 15.He also met with the incumbent delegate for District\n75 \u201cprobably half a dozen times\u201d and \u201cdiscussed the district with\nincumbents from other majority-black districts.\u201dAnte,at\n14\u201315 (internal quotation marks omitted). Those efforts add up, in\nthe majority\u2019s view, to a \u201ccareful assessment of local conditions\nand structures.\u201dAnte,at 15.I do not agree that those efforts satisfy narrow tailoring.\nDelegate Jones admitted that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of \u201cany\nretrogress[ion] analysis\u201d performed by \u201ch[im] or any persons that\nworked with him in the development of the [redistricting] plan.\u201d\nApp. 288\u2013289. Instead, he merely \u201clook[ed] at\u201d the \u201cpercentage of\nblack population and the percentage of black voting age\npopulation,\u201d \u201clooked at what happened over the last 10 year period\ngiven the existing population and demographic shifts,\u201d and \u201ctried\nto restore back\u201d the levels of black voting-age population from the\nprevious maps.Id.,at 290. That approach was misguided,\nbecause \u00a75 \u201cdoes not require maintaining the same population\npercentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan.\u201dAlabama,supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20). And in any\nevent, that back-of-the-envelope calculation does not qualify as\nrigorous analysis. I do not think we would permit so imprecise an\napproach with regard to any other instance of racial\ndiscrimination.The other evidence cited by the majority is similarly weak. The\nmajority points to the \u201c\u00a0\u2018half a dozen\u2019\u00a0\u201d meetings\nbetween Delegate Jones and the incumbent delegate for District 75,ante,at 14, but it is not apparent from the record whether\nDistrict 75\u2019s incumbent is the current black population\u2019s candidate\nof choice. Moreover, the incumbent delegate may well have wanted\nher district to be electorally safer than the Voting Rights Act\nrequires. It also is not obvious to me that Delegate Jones was\nseeking to avoid retrogression in District 75 when he met with\nincumbent delegates fromothermajority-black districts.Ibid.In my view, those efforts fall far short of\nestablishing that a 55% black voting-age population bears a more\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018exact connection\u2019\u00a0\u201d to the State\u2019s interest than any\nalternative percentage.Wygant,supra, at 279\n(opinion of Powell, J.). Accordingly, I would hold that the State\nfailed to narrowly tailor its use of race to avoid retrogression in\nDistrict 75.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In reaching these conclusions, I recognize that this Court is at\nleast as responsible as the state legislature for these racially\ngerrymandered districts. As explained above, this Court has\nrepeatedly failed to decide whether compliance with the Voting\nRights Act is a compelling governmental interest. Seesupra,at 3, and n. 2. Indeed, this Court has refused even to decide\nwhether \u00a75 is constitutional, despite having twice taken cases to\ndecide that question. Compare Juris. Statement inNorthwest\nAustin, O.\u00a0T. 2008, No. 08\u2013322, p. i (presenting the\nquestion \u201c[w]hether .\u00a0.\u00a0. the \u00a75 preclearance requirement\ncan be applied as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s remedial powers\nunder the Reconstruction Amendments\u201d), andShelby Countyv.Holder,568 U.\u00a0S. 1006 (2012) (granting certio-rari on\nthe question \u201c[w]hether Congress\u2019 decision in 2006 to reauthorize\nSection 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage\nformula of Section 4(b) .\u00a0.\u00a0. violated the Tenth\nAmendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution\u201d), withNorthwest Austin, 557 U.\u00a0S., at 197 (holding that the\ndistrict at issue was eligible to seek bailout under the Voting\nRights Act and therefore \u201cnot reach[ing] the constitutionality of\n\u00a75\u201d), andShelby Countyv.Holder,570 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 24) (holding only that the coverage\nformula under \u00a74(b) was unconstitutional and \u201cissu[ing] no holding\non \u00a75 itself\u201d). As a result, the Court has left the State without\nclear guidance about its redistricting obligations under \u00a75.This Court has put the State in a similar bind with respect to\nnarrow tailoring. To comply with \u00a75, a State necessarily must make\na deliberate and precise effort to sort its citizens on the basis\nof their race. But that result is fundamentally at odds with our\n\u201ccolor-blind\u201d Constitution, which \u201cneither knows nor tolerates\nclasses among citizens.\u201dPlessyv.Ferguson,163\nU.\u00a0S. 537,559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). That\ncontradiction illustrates the perversity of the Court\u2019s\njurisprudence in this area as well as the uncomfortable position in\nwhich the State might find itself.Despite my sympathy for the State, I cannot ignore the\nConstitution\u2019s clear prohibition on state-sponsored race\ndiscrimination. \u201cThe Constitution abhors classifications based on\nrace, not only because those classifications can harm favored races\nor are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time\nthe government places citizens on racial registers .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n, it demeans us all.\u201dGrutter, 539 U.\u00a0S., at 353\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This\nprohibition was \u201c[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human\nsuffering,\u201d and it \u201creflects our Nation\u2019s understanding that such\nclassifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the\nindividual and our society.\u201dAdarand Constructors, 515\nU.\u00a0S., at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment as\nto District 75.Notes1It is unclear from the record whether\nthe State sought to justify its use of race on other grounds. I\nwould leave it to the District Court to evaluate in the first\ninstance any other asserted compelling interest, including whether\nsuch interest has been forfeited.2See alsoShawv.Hunt,517 U.\u00a0S. 899,911 (1996) (\u201cInMiller, we\nexpressly left open the question whether under the proper\ncircumstances compliance with the Voting Rights Act, on its own,\ncould be a compelling [state] interest .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.
