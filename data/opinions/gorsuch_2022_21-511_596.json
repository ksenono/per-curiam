TWYFORD, IIIon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 21, 2022]Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.The Court granted review to decide whether and\nunder what circumstances a federal district court may order a State\nto transport a prisoner to a hospital for testing. Later, however,\nit became clear a potential jurisdictional defect threatened to\npreclude the Court from reaching that question. The District\nCourt\u2019s transportation ruling was an interlocutory order, not a\nfinal judgment. To address its merits, the Court would first have\nto extend the collateral order doctrine to a new class of cases.\nSeeCohenv.Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,337 U.S.\n541, 545\u2013547 (1949). In a terse footnote today, the Court does\njust that.Ante, at\u00a05, n.\u00a01.Respectfully, I would have dismissed this case\nas improvidently granted when the jurisdictional complication\nbecame apparent. We did not take this case to extendCohen.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly \u201cadmoni[shed]\u201d other courts to keep\n\u201cthe class of collaterally appealable orders .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n\u2018narrow and selective.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMohawk Industries, Inc.v.Carpenter,558 U.S.\n100, 113 (2009). If anything, this call for caution \u201chas\nacquired special force in recent years with the enactment of\nlegislation designating rulemaking .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the preferred\nmeans for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be\nimmediately appealable.\u201dIbid.",
