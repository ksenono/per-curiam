An attorney error does not qualify as \u201ccause\u201d to excuse a\nprocedural default unless the error amounted to constitutionally\nineffective assistance of counsel. Because a prisoner does not have\na constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction\nproceedings, ineffective assistance in those proceedings does not\nqualify as cause to excuse a procedural default. SeeColemanv.Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722 (1991) .InMartinezv.Ryan, 566\nU.\u00a0S. 1 (2012) , andTrevinov.Thaler, 569\nU.\u00a0S. 413 (2013) , this Court announced a narrow exception toColeman\u2019s general rule. That exception treats ineffective\nassistance by a prisoner\u2019s state postconviction counsel as cause to\novercome the default of a single claim\u2014ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel\u2014in a single context\u2014where the State effectively\nrequires a defendant to bring that claim in state postconviction\nproceedings rather than on direct appeal. The question in this case\nis whether we should extend that exception to allow federal courts\nto consider a different kind of defaulted claim\u2014ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel. We decline to do so.IAOn April 6, 2008, a group of family and\nfriends gathered at Annette Stevenson\u2019s home to celebrate her\ngranddaughter\u2019s birthday. Petitioner Erick Daniel Davila, believing\nhe had seen a member of a rival street gang at the celebration,\nfired a rifle at the group while they were eating cake and ice\ncream. He shot and killed Annette and her 5-year-old granddaughter\nQueshawn, and he wounded three other children and one woman.After the police arrested petitioner, he\nconfessed to the killings. He stated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t aiming at the\nkids or the woman,\u201d but that he was trying to kill Annette\u2019s son\n(and Queshawn\u2019s father) Jerry Stevenson and the other \u201cguys on the\nporch.\u201d App. 38. The other \u201cguys on the porch\u201d were, apparently,\nwomen.The State indicted petitioner for capital murder\nunder Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a719.03(a)(7)(A) (West 2016), which makes\nit a capital crime to \u201cmurde[r] more than one person\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. during the same criminal transaction.\u201d In response\nto the jury\u2019s request for clarification during deliberations, the\ntrial court proposed instructing the jury on transferred intent.\nUnder that doctrine, the jury could find petitioner guilty of\nmurder if it determined that he intended to kill one person but\ninstead killed a different person. Petitioner\u2019s counsel objected to\nthe additional instruction, arguing that the trial judge should\n\u201cwait\u201d to submit it \u201cuntil the jury indicates that they can\u2019t reach\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a resolution.\u201d App. 51. The trial court overruled\nthe objection and submitted the instruction to the jury. The jury\nconvicted petitioner of capital murder, and the trial court\nsentenced petitioner to death.BPetitioner appealed his conviction and\nsentence. Al-though his appellate counsel argued that the State\npresented insufficient evidence to show that he acted with the\nrequisite intent, counsel did not challenge the instruction about\ntransferred intent. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed\npetitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence.Davilav.State, 2011 WL 303265 (Jan. 26, 2011), cert. denied, 565\nU.\u00a0S. 885 (2011) .Petitioner next sought habeas relief in Texas\nstate court. His counsel did not challenge the instruction about\ntransferred intent, nor did he challenge the failure of his\nappellate counsel to raise the alleged instructional error on\ndirect appeal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief.Ex\u00a0parte Davila, 2013 WL 1655549 (Apr. 17, 2013), cert.\ndenied, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013).CPetitioner then sought habeas relief in\nFederal District Court under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254. As\nrelevant here, he argued that his appellate counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to challenge the jury instruction\nabout transferred intent. Petitioner conceded that he had failed to\nraise his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in\nhis state habeas petition, but argued that the failure was the\nresult of his state habeas counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance.\nPetitioner invoked this Court\u2019s decisions inMartinezandTrevinoto argue that his state habeas attorney\u2019s\nineffective assistance provided cause to excuse the procedural\ndefault of his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel.The District Court denied petitioner\u2019s \u00a72254\npetition. It concluded thatMartinezandTrevinodid\nnot supply cause to excuse the procedural default of petitioner\u2019s\nclaim of ineffective assistance ofappellatecounsel because\nthose decisions applied exclusively to claims of ineffective\nassistance oftrialcounsel. SeeDavilav.Stephens, 2015 WL 1808689, *20 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2015). The\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of\nappealability on the same ground. 650 Fed.\u00a0Appx. 860, 867\u2013868\n(2016). Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari, asking us to\nreverse the Fifth Circuit on the ground thatMartinezandTrevinoshould be extended to claims of ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel. We granted certiorari, 580\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), and now affirm.IIOur decision in this case is guided by two\nfundamental tenets of federal review of state convictions. First, a\nstate prisoner must exhaust available state remedies before\npresenting his claim to a federal habeas court. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). The\nexhaustion requirement is designed to avoid the \u201cunseemly\u201d result\nof a federal court \u201cupset[ting] a state court conviction without\u201d\nfirst according the state courts an \u201copportunity to .\u00a0.\u00a0.\ncorrect a constitutional violation,\u201dRosev.Lundy,\n455 U.\u00a0S. 509, 518 (1982) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).Second, a federal court may not review federal\nclaims that were procedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is,\nclaims that the state court denied based on an adequate and\nindependent state procedural rule.E.g., Beardv.Kindler, 558 U.\u00a0S. 53, 55 (2009) . This is an important\n\u201ccorollary\u201d to the exhaustion requirement.Dretkev.Haley, 541 U.\u00a0S. 386, 392 (2004) . \u201cJust as in those\ncases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a\nhabeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural\nrequirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the\nstate courts of an opportunity to address\u201d the merits of \u201cthose\nclaims in the first instance.\u201dColeman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at\n731\u2013732.[1] The procedural\ndefault doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and\nfederalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine. SeeMcCleskeyv.Zant, 499 U.\u00a0S. 467, 493 (1991)\n.A state prisoner may overcome the prohibition on\nreviewing procedurally defaulted claims if he can show \u201ccause\u201d to\nexcuse his failure to comply with the state procedural rule and\n\u201cactual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional\nviolation.\u201dWainwrightv.Sykes, 433 U.\u00a0S. 72,\n84 (1977) ;Coleman,supra, at 750. To establish\n\u201ccause\u201d\u2014the element of the doctrine relevant in this case\u2014the\nprisoner must \u201cshow that some objective factor external to the\ndefense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201dMurrayv.Carrier, 477 U.\u00a0S.\n478, 488 (1986) . A factor is external to the defense if it \u201ccannot\nfairly be attributed to\u201d the prisoner.Coleman,supra,at 753.It has long been the rule that attorney error is\nan objective external factor providing cause for excusing a\nprocedural default only if that error amounted to a deprivation of\nthe constitutional right to counsel. SeeEdwardsv.Carpenter, 529 U.\u00a0S. 446, 451 (2000) . An error\namounting to constitutionally ineffective assistance is \u201cimputed to\nthe State\u201d and is therefore external to the prisoner.Murray,supra, at 488. Attorney error that does not\nviolate the Constitution, however, is attributed to the prisoner\n\u201cunder well-settled principles of agency law.\u201dColeman,supra, at 754. It follows, then, that in proceedings for\nwhich the Constitution does not guarantee the assistance of counsel\nat all, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse a default.\nThus, inColeman, this Court held that attorney error\ncommitted in the course of state postconviction proceedings\u2014for\nwhich the Constitution does not guarantee the right to counsel, seeMurrayv.Giarratano, 492 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1989)\n(plurality opinion)\u2014cannot supply cause to excuse a procedural\ndefault that occurs in those proceedings. 501 U.\u00a0S., at\n755.InMartinez, this Court announced a\nnarrow, \u201cequitable .\u00a0.\u00a0. qualification\u201d of the rule inColemanthat applies where state law requires prisoners to\nraise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel \u201cin an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding,\u201d rather than on direct\nappeal.Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 16, 17. It held that,\nin those situations, \u201ca procedural default will not bar a federal\nhabeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective\nassistance at trial if\u201d the default results from the ineffective\nassistance of the prisoner\u2019s counsel in the collateral proceeding.Id.,at 17. InTrevino, the Court clarified that this\nexception applies both where state law explicitly prohibits\nprisoners from bringing claims of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal and where the State\u2019s \u201cprocedural\nframework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it unlikely\nin a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful\nopportunity to raise\u201d that claim on direct appeal. 569 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14).IIIPetitioner asks us to extendMartinezto allow a federal court to hear a substantial, but procedurally\ndefaulted, claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\nwhen a prisoner\u2019s state postconviction counsel provides ineffective\nassistance by failing to raise that claim. We decline to do so.AOn its face,Martinezprovides no\nsupport for extending its narrow exception to new categories of\nprocedurally defaulted claims.Martinezdid not purport to\ndisplaceColemanas the general rule governing procedural\ndefault. Rather, it \u201cqualifie[d]Colemanby recognizing a\nnarrow exception\u201d that applies only to claims of \u201cineffective\nassistance of counsel at trial\u201d and only when, \u201cunder state law,\u201d\nthose claims \u201cmust be raised in an initial-review collateral\nproceeding.\u201dMartinez,supra, at 9, 17. AndTrevinomerely clarified that the exception applies whether\nstate law explicitly or effectively forecloses review of the claim\non direct appeal. 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op. at 2, 13). In\nall but those \u201climited circumstances,\u201dMartinezmade clear\nthat \u201c[t]he rule ofColemangoverns.\u201d 566 U.\u00a0S., at 16.\nApplyingMartinez\u2019s highly circumscribed, equitable\nexception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims would\nthus do precisely what this Court disclaimed inMartinez:\nReplace the rule ofColemanwith the exception ofMartinez.BPetitioner also finds no support in the\nunderlying rationale ofMartinez. Petitioner\u2019s primary\nargument is that his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel might never be reviewed by any court, state or federal,\nwithout expanding the exception to the rule inColeman. He\nargues that this situation is analogous toMartinez,where\nthe Court expressed that same concern about claims of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel. But the Court inMartinezwas\nprincipally concerned abouttrial errors\u2014in particular,\nclaims of ineffective assistance oftrialcounsel.\nIneffective assistance of appellate counsel is not a trial error.\nNor is petitioner\u2019s rule necessary to ensure that a meritorious\ntrial error (of any kind) receives review.1Petitioner argues that allowing a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel to evade review is just\nas concerning as allowing a claim of ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel to evade review. Brief for Petitioner 12; see alsoid.,at 18\u201326. We do not agree.The criminal trial enjoys pride of place in our\ncriminal justice system in a way that an appeal from that trial\ndoes not. The Constitution twice guarantees the right to a criminal\ntrial, see Art. III, \u00a72; Amdt. 6, but does not guarantee the right\nto an appeal at all,Halbertv.Michigan, 545\nU.\u00a0S. 605, 610 (2005) . The trial \u201cis the main event at which\na defendant\u2019s rights are to be determined,\u201dMcFarlandv.Scott, 512 U.\u00a0S. 849, 859 (1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), \u201cand not simply a tryout on the road to appellate\nreview,\u201dFreytagv.Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S. 868,\n895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it is where the\nstakes for the defendant are highest, not least because it is where\na presumptively innocent defendant is adjudged guilty, seeRossv.Moffitt, 417 U.\u00a0S. 600, 610 (1974) ;Wainwright, 433 U.\u00a0S., at 90, and where the trial judge\nor jury makes factual findings that nearly always receive deference\non appeal and collateral review, seeJacksonv.Virginia, 443 U.\u00a0S. 307 \u2013319 (1979); see alsoCavazosv.Smith, 565 U.\u00a0S. 1, 2 (2011) (per\ncuriam) (under deferential standard of review, \u201cjudges will\nsometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken,\nbut that they must nevertheless uphold\u201d).The Court inMartinezmade clear that it\nexercised its equitable discretion in view of the unique importance\nof protecting a defendant\u2019s trial rights, particularly the right to\neffective assistance of trial counsel. As the Court explained, \u201cthe\nlimited nature\u201d of its holding \u201creflect[ed] the importance of the\nright to the effective assistance oftrialcounsel,\u201d which\nis \u201ca bedrock principle in our justice system.\u201d 566 U.\u00a0S., at\n12, 16 (emphasis added). In declining to expand theMartinezexception to the distinct context of ineffective assistance of\nappellate counsel, we do no more than respect that judgment.2Petitioner\u2019s rule also is not required to\nensure that meritorious claims of trial error receive review by at\nleast one state or federal court\u2014the chief concern identified by\nthis Court inMartinez. Seeid., at 10, 12.Martinezwas concerned that a claim of trial\nerror\u2014specifically, ineffective assistance of trial counsel\u2014might\nescape review in a State that required prisoners to bring the claim\nfor the first time in state postconviction proceedings rather than\non direct appeal. Because it is difficult to assess a trial\nattorney\u2019s performance until the trial has ended, a trial court\nordinarily will not have the opportunity to rule on such a claim.\nAnd when the State requires a prisoner to wait until postconviction\nproceedings to raise the claim, the appellate court on direct\nappeal also will not have the opportunity to review it. If\npostconviction counsel then fails to raise the claim, no state\ncourt will ever review it. Finally, because attorney error in a\nstate postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse\nprocedural default underColeman, no federal court could\nconsider the claim either.Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel, however, do not pose the same risk that a trial error\u2014of\nany kind\u2014will escape review altogether, at least in a way that\ncould be remedied by petitioner\u2019s proposed rule. This is true\nregardless of whether trial counsel preserved the alleged error at\ntrial. If trial counsel preserved the error by properly objecting,\nthen that claim of trial error \u201cwill have been addressed by\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the trial court.\u201dMartinez, 566 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 11. A claim of appellate ineffectiveness premised on a preserved\ntrial error thus does not present the same concern that animated\ntheMartinezexception because at least \u201cone court\u201d will\nhave considered the claim on the merits.Ibid.; see alsoColeman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 755\u2013756.If trial counsel failed to preserve the error at\ntrial, then petitioner\u2019s proposed rule ordinarily would not give\nthe prisoner access to federal review of the error, anyway.\nEffective appellate counsel should not raise every nonfrivolous\nargument on appeal, but rather only those arguments most likely to\nsucceed.Smithv.Murray, 477 U.\u00a0S. 527, 536\n(1986) ;Jonesv.Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S. 745 \u2013753\n(1983). Declining to raise a claim on appeal, therefore, is not\ndeficient performance unless that claim was plainly stronger than\nthose actually presented to the appellate court. SeeSmithv.Robbins, 528 U.\u00a0S. 259, 288 (2000) . In most cases,\nan unpreserved trial error will not be a plainly stronger ground\nfor appeal than preserved errors. See 2 B. Means, Postconviction\nRemedies \u00a735:19, p. 627, and n.\u00a016 (2016). Thus, in most\ninstances in which the trial court did not rule on the alleged\ntrial error (because it was not preserved), the prisoner could not\nmake out a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel and therefore could not avail himself of petitioner\u2019s\nexpandedMartinezexception.Adopting petitioner\u2019s proposed rule would be\nunnecessary to ensure review of a claim of trial error even when a\nprisoner has a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of\nappellate counsel based on something other than a preserved trial\nerror. If an unpreserved trial error was so obvious that appellate\ncounsel was constitutionally required to raise it on appeal, then\ntrial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to\nobject to it in the first instance. In that circumstance, the\nprisoner likely could invokeMartinezorColemanto\nobtain review of trial counsel\u2019s failure to object. Similarly, if\nthe underlying, defaulted claim of trial error was ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel premised on something other than the\nfailure to object, thenMartinezandColemanagain\nalready provide a vehicle for obtaining review of that error in\nmost circumstances. Petitioner\u2019s proposed rule is thus unnecessary\nfor ensuring that trial errors are reviewed by at least one\ncourt.CThe Court inMartinezalso was\nresponding to an equitable consideration that is unique to claims\nof ineffective assistance of trial counsel and accordingly\ninapplicable to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel. InMartinez, the State \u201cdeliberately cho[se] to\nmove trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal\nprocess, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,\u201d into the\npostconviction review process, where we have never held that the\nConstitution guarantees a right to counsel. 566 U.\u00a0S., at 13;id.,at 9. By doing so, \u201cthe State significantly\ndiminishe[d] prisoners\u2019 ability to file such claims.\u201dId.,at 13. Similarly, inTrevino, the State had chosen a\nprocedural framework pursuant to which collateral review was, \u201cas a\npractical matter, the onl[y] method for raising an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\u201d 569 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (slip op., at 13).Although this Court acknowledged inMartinezthat there was nothing inappropriate about the\nState\u2019s choice, it explained that the choice was \u201cnot without\nconsequences for the State\u2019s ability to assert a procedural\ndefault\u201d in subsequent federal habeas proceedings. 566 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 13. Specifically, the Court concluded that it would be\ninequitable to refuse to hear a defaulted claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel when the State had channeled that claim\nto a forum where the prisoner might lack the assistance of counsel\nin raising it.The States have not made a similar choice with\nrespect to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel\u2014nor could they. By their very nature, such claims\ngener-ally cannot be presented untilafterthe termination\nof direct appeal. Put another way, theynecessarilymust be\nheard in collateral proceedings, where counsel is not\nconstitutionally guaranteed. The fact that claims of appellate\nineffectiveness are considered in proceedings in which counsel is\nnot constitutionally guaranteed is a function of the nature of the\nclaim, not of the State\u2019s \u201cdeliberat[e] cho[ice] to move\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. claims outside of the direct-appeal process.\u201dIbid.The equitable concerns raised inMartineztherefore do not apply.DFinally, the Court inMartinezgrounded\nits decision in part on the belief that its narrow exception was\nunlikely to impose significant systemic costs. Seeid.,at\n15\u201316. The same cannot be said of petitioner\u2019s proposed\nextension.1Adopting petitioner\u2019s argument could flood the\nfederal courts with defaulted claims of appellate ineffectiveness.\nFor one thing, every prisoner in the country could bring these\nclaims.Martinezcurrently applies only to States that\ndeliberately choose to channel claims of ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel into collateral proceedings. See,e.g., Leev.Corsini, 777 F.\u00a03d 46, 60\u201361 (CA1 2015)\n(MartinezandTrevinodo not apply to Massachusetts);Hennessv.Bagley, 766 F.\u00a03d 550, 557 (CA6 2014)\n(Martinezdoes not apply to Ohio). If we appliedMartinezto claims of appellate ineffectiveness, however, we\nwould bring every State withinMartinez\u2019s ambit, because\nclaims of appellate ineffectiveness necessarily must be heard in\ncollateral proceedings. Seesupra,at 12.ExtendingMartinezto defaulted claims of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel would be especially\ntroublesome because those claims could serve as the gatewayto\nfederal review of a host of trial errors, whileMartinezcovers only one trial error (ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel). If a prisoner can establish ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel underMartinez, he ordinarily is entitled to a\nnew trial. SeeUnited Statesv.Morrison, 449\nU.\u00a0S. 361 \u2013365 (1981); see alsoHagensv.State,\n979 S.\u00a0W. 2d 788, 792 (Tex. App. 1998). But if he cannot,Martinezprovides no avenue for litigating other defaulted\ntrial errors.[2]An expandedMartinezexception, however,\nwould mean thatanydefaulted trial error could result in a\nnew trial. InCarpenter, this Court held that, when a\nprisoner can show cause to excuse a defaulted claim of ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel, he can in turn rely on that claim\nas cause to litigate an underlying claim of trial error that was\ndefaulted due to appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 453. ExpandingMartinezas petitioner\nsuggests would thus produce a domino effect: Prisoners could assert\ntheir postconviction counsel\u2019s inadequacy as cause to excuse the\ndefault of their appellate ineffectiveness claims, and use those\nnewly reviewable appellate ineffectiveness claims as cause to\nexcuse the default of their underlying claims of trial error.\nPetitioner\u2019s rule thus could ultimately knock down the procedural\nbarriers to federal habeas review of nearly any defaulted claim of\ntrial error. The scope of that review would exceed anything theMartinezCourt envisioned when it established its narrow\nexception toColeman.Petitioner insists that these concerns are\noverstated because many of the newly raised claims will be\nmeritless. See Brief for Petitioner 28. But even if that were true,\ncourts would still have to undertake the task of separating the\nwheat from the chaff. And we are not reassured by petitioner\u2019s\nsuggestion that extendingMartinezwould increase only the\nnumber of claims in each petition rather than the number of federal\nhabeas petitions themselves. Reply Brief 14. Each additional claim\nwould require the district court to review the prisoner\u2019s trial\nrecord, appellate briefing, and state postconviction record to\ndetermine the claim\u2019s viability. This effort could be repeated at\neach level of federal review. We cannot \u201cassume that these costs\nwould be negligible,\u201dMurray, 477 U.\u00a0S., at 487, and we\nare loath to further \u201cburden .\u00a0.\u00a0. scarce federal\njudicial resources\u201d in this way,McCleskey, 499 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 491.2ExpandingMartinezwould not only\nimpose significant costs on the federal courts, but would also\naggravate the harm to federalism that federal habeas review\nnecessarily causes. Federal habeas review of state convictions\n\u201centails significant costs,\u201dEnglev.Isaac, 456\nU.\u00a0S. 107, 126 (1982) , \u201c\u00a0\u2018and intrudes on state\nsovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal\njudicial authority,\u2019\u00a0\u201dHarringtonv.Richter,\n562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011) (quotingHarrisv.Reed, 489 U.\u00a0S. 255, 282 (1989) (Kennedy, J.,\ndissenting)). It \u201cfrustrates both the States\u2019 sovereign power to\npunish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor\nconstitutional rights.\u201dCalderonv.Thompson, 523\nU.\u00a0S. 538 \u2013556 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). It\n\u201cdegrades the prominence of the [State] trial,\u201dEngle,supra, at 127, and it \u201cdisturbs the State\u2019s significant\ninterest in repose for concluded litigation [and] denies society\nthe right to punish some admitted offenders,\u201dHarrington,supra,at 103 (internal quotation marksomitted).Apart from increasing the sheer frequency of\nfederal intrusion into state criminal affairs, petitioner\u2019s\nproposed rule would also undermine the doctrine of procedural\ndefault and the values it serves. That doctrine, like the federal\nhabeas statute generally, is designed to ameliorate the injuries to\nstate sovereignty that federal habeas review necessarily inflicts\nby giving state courts the first opportunity to address challenges\nto convictions in state court, thereby \u201cpromoting comity, finality,\nand federalism.\u201dCullenv.Pinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S.\n170, 185 (2011) ;McCleskey,supra, at 493. Expanding\nthe narrow exception announced inMartinezwould unduly\naggravate the \u201cspecial costs on our federal system\u201d that federal\nhabeas review already imposes.Engle,supra, at\n128.3Not only would these burdens on the federal\ncourts and our federal system be severe, but the benefit would\u2014as a\nsystemic matter\u2014be small. To be sure, permitting a state prisoner\nto bring a meritorious constitutional claim that could not\notherwise be heard is beneficial to that prisoner. Petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel concedes, however, that relief is granted in, \u201c[i]f any, a\nvery minute number\u201d of \u201cpost-conviction ineffective assistance of\nappellate counselcases.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. Indeed, he concedes\nthat the number of meritorious cases is \u201cinfinitesimally small.\u201dIbid.We think it is likely that the claims heard in federal\ncourt because of petitioner\u2019s proposed rule would also be largely\nmeritless, given that the proposed rule would generally affect only\nthose cases in which the trial court already adjudicated, and\nrejected, the prisoner\u2019s argument regarding the alleged underlying\ntrial error. Seesupra,at 11. Given that petitioner\u2019s\nproposed rule would likely generate high systemic costs and low\nsystemic benefits, and that the unique concerns ofMartinezare not implicated in cases like his, we do not think equity\nrequires anexpansion ofMartinez.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.It is so ordered.Notes1The Fifth Circuit treats\nunexhausted claims as procedurally defaulted if \u201cthe court to which\nthe petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to\nmeet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims\nprocedurally barred.\u201dBagwellv.Dretke, 372\nF.\u00a03d 748, 755 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf.Coleman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 735, n. Relying on this\ndoctrine, the District Court concluded that petitioner\u2019s federal\nclaim was procedurally defaulted (even though a state court had\nnever actually found it procedurally barred) because Texas law\nwould likely bar a Texas court from deciding the claim on the\nmerits if petitioner were to present it in a successive habeas\npetition.Davilav.Stephens, 2015 WL 1808689,\n*19\u2013*20 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2015) (citingDavilav.Stephens, 2014 WL 5879879, *2 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2014)); see\nalsoDavilav.Stephens, 2014 WL 6057907, *2 (ND\nTex., Nov. 10, 2014). Petitioner did not seek a certificate of\nappealability regarding that holding, and neither petitioner nor\nthe State disputes in this Court that the claim was procedurally\ndefaulted. Accordingly, we assume that it was procedurally\ndefaulted for purposes of this case.2The dissent argues thatMartinezalready provides a gateway to the review of\nunderlying trial errors no differently than would petitioner\u2019s\nproposed rule. Seepost,at 7 (opinion of Breyer, J.). That\nis not so. If a prisoner succeeds on his claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel underMartinez, the federal\nhabeas court would not need to consider any other claim of trial\nerror since the successful claim of trial ineffectiveness\u2014unlike a\nsuccessful claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel\u2014entitles the prisoner to a new trial.
