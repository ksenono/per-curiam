MONT, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 3, 2019]Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.This case requires the Court to decide whether a\nconvicted criminal\u2019s period of supervised release is tolled\u2014in\neffect, paused\u2014during his pretrial detention for a new criminal\noffense. Specifically, the question is whether that pretrial\ndetention qualifies as \u201cimprison[ment] in connection with a\nconviction for a Federal, State, or local crime.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(e). Given the text and statutory context\nof \u00a73624(e),we conclude that if the court\u2019s later imposed sentence\ncredits the period of pretrial detention as time served for the new\noffense, then the pretrial detention also tolls the\nsupervised-release period.IAIn 2004, petitioner Jason Mont began\ndistributing cocaine and crack cocaine in northern Ohio. After\nsubstantial drug sales to a confidential informant and a search of\nhis home that uncovered handguns and $2,700 in cash, a federal\ngrand jury indicted Mont for multiple drug and firearm offenses. He\nlater pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to\ndistribute cocaine, and to possessing a firearm and ammunition\nafter having been convicted of a felony. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(g)(1) (2000 ed.); 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1), 846 (2000\ned.).The District Court sentenced Mont to 120 months\u2019\nimprisonment, later reduced to 84 months, to be followed by 5 years\nof supervised release. Mont was released from federal prison on\nMarch 6, 2012, and his supervised release was \u201cslated to end on\nMarch 6, 2017.\u201d 723 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA6 2018); see 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(e) (a \u201cterm of supervised release\ncommences on the day the person is released from imprisonment\u201d).\nAmong other standard conditions, Mont\u2019s supervised release required\nthat he \u201cnot commit another federal, state, or local crime,\u201d \u201cnot\nillegally possess a controlled substance,\u201d and \u201crefrain from any\nunlawful use of a controlled substance.\u201d Judgment in No.\n4:05\u2013cr\u201300229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 37, p. 111.Mont did not succeed on supervised release. In\nMarch 2015, an Ohio grand jury charged him with two counts of\nmarijuana trafficking in a sealed indictment. Mont was arrested and\nreleased on bond while awaiting trial for those charges. Things\nonly got worse from there. In October 2015, Mont tested positive\nfor cocaine and oxycodone during a routine drug test conducted as\npart of his supervised release. But Mont\u2019s probation officer did\nnot immediately report these violations to the District Court;\ninstead, the officer referred him for additional substance-abuse\ncounseling. Mont proceeded to test positive in five more random\ndrug tests over the next few months. He also used an\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018unknown\u2019 liquid to try to pass two subsequent drug tests.\u201d\n723 Fed. Appx., at 326. In Jan- uary 2016, Mont\u2019s probation officer\nfinally reported the supervised-release violations, including\nMont\u2019s use of drugs and attempts to adulterate his urine samples.\nThe violation report also informed the District Court about the\npending state charges and the anticipated trial date of March 2016\nin state court. The District Court declined to issue an arrest\nwarrant at that time, but it asked to \u201c\u00a0\u2018be notified of the\nresolution of the state charges.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.; see 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73606 (explaining that the District Court \u201cmay\nissue a warrant for the arrest\u201d of the releasee for \u201cviolation of a\ncondition of release\u201d).On June 1, 2016, approximately four years and\nthree months into his 5-year term of supervised release, Mont was\narrested again on new state charges of trafficking in cocaine, and\nhis bond was revoked on the earlier marijuana-trafficking charges.\nHe was incarcerated in the Ma- honing County Jail and has remained\nin state custody since that date. Mont\u2019s probation officer filed a\nreport with the District Court stating that he had violated the\nterms of his release based on these new state offenses. The officer\nlater advised the court that because Mont\u2019s incarceration rendered\nhim unavailable for supervision, the Probation Office was\n\u201ctoll[ing]\u201d his federal supervision. App. 21. The officer promised\nto keep the court apprised of the pending state charges and stated\nthat, if Mont were convicted, the officer would ask the court to\ntake action at that time.In October 2016, Mont entered into plea\nagreements with state prosecutors in exchange for a predetermined\n6-year sentence. The state trial court accepted Mont\u2019s guilty pleas\non October 6, 2016, and set the cases for sentencing in December\n2016.Three weeks later, Mont filed a written\nadmission in the District Court \u201cacknowledg[ing]\u201d that he had\nviolated his conditions of supervised release \u201cby virtue of his\nconviction following guilty pleas to certain felony offenses\u201d in\nstate court. Record in No. 4:05\u2013cr\u201300229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 92,\np.\u00a0419. Even though he had yet to be sentenced for the state\noffenses, Mont sought a hearing on the supervised-release\nviolations at the court\u2019s \u201cearliest convenience.\u201dIbid.The\ncourt initially scheduled a hearing for November 9, 2016, but then,\nover Mont\u2019s objection, rescheduled the hearing several times to\nallow for \u201cthe conclusion of the State sentencing.\u201d App. 8; 723\nFed. Appx., at 327.On March 21, 2017, Mont was sentenced in state\ncourt to six years\u2019 imprisonment. The judge \u201ccredited the roughly\nten months that Mont had already been incarcerated pending a\ndisposition as time served.\u201dId.,at 327. The District Court\nissued a warrant on March 30, 2017, and ultimately set a\nsupervised-release hearing for June 28, 2017.BTwo days before that hearing, Mont challenged\nthe jurisdiction of the District Court based on the fact that his\nsupervised release had initially been set to expire on March 6,\n2017. The court concluded that it had authority to supervise Mont,\nrevoked his supervised release, and ordered him to serve an\nadditional 42 months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutive to his state\nsentence. The court held that it retained jurisdiction to revoke\nthe release under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73583(i), which preserves, for a\n\u201creasonably necessary\u201d period of time, the court\u2019s power to\nadjudicate violations and revoke a term of supervised release after\nthe term has expired \u201cif, before its expiration, a warrant or\nsummons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a\nviolation.\u201d The court further held that it retained authority to\nrevoke Mont\u2019s term of supervised release because it gave \u201cnotice by\nway of a summons\u201d on November 1, 2016, when it originally scheduled\nthe hearing. App. 22. The court also concluded that the delay\nbetween the guilty pleas in October 2016 and the hearing date in\nJune 2017 was \u201creasonably necessary.\u201dId., at 24.The Sixth Circuit affirmed on alternative\ngrounds. The court could find no evidence in the record that a\nsummons had issued within the meaning of \u00a73583(i). 723 Fed. Appx.,\nat 329, n.\u00a05. But because Circuit precedent pro- vided an\nalternative basis for affirmance, the court did not further\nconsider the Government\u2019s argument that the District Court retained\njurisdiction under \u00a73583(i). Instead, the court held that Mont\u2019s\nsupervised-release period was tolled while he was held in pretrial\ndetention in state custody under \u00a73624(e), which provides:\u201c(e) Supervision After Release.\u2014\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. The term of supervised release commences on the day\nthe person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with\nany Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised\nrelease or parole for another offense to which the person is\nsubject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release. A\nterm of supervised release does not run during any period in which\nthe personis imprisoned in connection with a convictionfor\na Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a\nperiod of less than 30 consecutive days.\u201d (Emphasis added.)Relying on Circuit precedent, the Sixth Circuit\nexplained that when a defendant is convicted of the offense for\nwhich he was held in pretrial detention for longer than 30 days and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018his pretrial detention is credited as time served toward\nhis sentence, then the pretrial detention is \u201cin connection with\u201d a\nconviction and tolls the period of supervised release under\n\u00a73624.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 328 (quotingUnited Statesv.Goins, 516 F.3d 416, 417 (2008)). Because Mont\u2019s term of\nsupervised release had been tolled between June 2016 and March\n2017, there was ample time left on his supervised-release term when\nthe warrant issued on March 30, 2017.The Courts of Appeals disagree on whether\n\u00a73624(e) tolls supervised release for periods of pretrial detention\nlasting longer than 30 days when that incarceration is later\ncredited as time served on a conviction. CompareUnited\nStatesv.Ide, 624 F.3d 666, 667 (CA4 2010)\n(supervised-release period tolls);United Statesv.Molina-Gazca, 571 F.3d 470, 474 (CA5 2009) (same);United\nStatesv.Johnson, 581 F.3d 1310, 1312\u20131313 (CA11 2009)\n(same);Goins,supra, at 417 (same), withUnited\nStatesv.Marsh, 829 F.3d 705, 709 (CADC 2016)\n(supervised-release period does not toll);United Statesv.Morales-Alejo,193 F.3d 1102,1106(CA9 1999) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve this\nsplit of authority. 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).IIWe hold that pretrial detention later credited\nas time served for a new conviction is \u201cimprison[ment] in\nconnection with a conviction\u201d and thus tolls the supervised-release\nterm under \u00a73624(e). This is so even if the court must make the\ntolling calculation after learning whether the time will be\ncredited. In our view, this reading is compelled by the text and\nstatutory context of \u00a73624(e).ASection 3624(e) provides for tolling when a\nperson \u201cis imprisoned in connection with a conviction.\u201d This\nphrase, sensibly read, includes pretrial detention credited toward\nanother sentence for a new conviction.First, the definition of \u201cis imprisoned\u201d may\nwell include pretrial detention. Both now and at the time Congress\ncreated supervised release, see \u00a7212(a)(2), 98Stat. 1999\u20132000, the\nterm \u201cimprison\u201d has meant \u201c[t]o put in a prison,\u201d \u201cto incarcerate,\u201d\n\u201c[t]o confine a person, or restrain his liberty, in any way.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 681 (5th ed. 1979); 5 Oxford English\nDictionary 113 (1933); accord, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 875 (10th ed.\n2014). These definitions encompass pretrial detention, and, despite\nthe dissent\u2019s reliance on a narrower definition,post,at\n5\u20137 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), even Mont has not pressed any\nserious argument to the contrary. As the Sixth Circuit previously\nrecognized, if imprisonment referred only to \u201cconfinement that is\nthe result of a penalty or sentence, then the phrase \u2018in connection\nwith a conviction\u2019 [would] becom[e] entirely superfluous.\u201dGoins,supra, at 421.Second, the phrase \u201cin connection with a\nconviction\u201d encompasses a period of pretrial detention for which a\ndefendant receives credit against the sentence ultimately imposed.\nThe Court has often recognized that \u201cin connection with\u201d can bear a\n\u201cbroad interpretation.\u201dMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Inc.v.Dabit,547 U.S.\n71, 85 (2006) (interpreting \u201cin connection with the purchase or\nsale\u201d broadly in the context of \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b)); see,e.g., United\nStatesv.American Union Transport, Inc.,327 U.S.\n437, 443 (1946) (describing the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in\nthe Shipping Act, 1916, 39Stat. 728, as \u201cbroad and general\u201d). The\nCourt has also recognized that \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0in connection with\u2019 is\nessentially indeterminate because connections, like relations, stop\nnowhere.\u201dMaracichv.Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 59 (2013)\n(quotation altered). Here, however, we need not consider the outer\nbounds of the term \u201cin connection with,\u201d as pretrial incarceration\nisdirectlytied to the conviction when it is credited\ntoward the new sentence. The judgment of the state court stated as\nmuch, crediting the pretrial detention that Mont served while\nawaiting trial and sentencing for his crimes against his ultimate\nsentence for those same crimes.This reading of \u201cimprison[ment] in connection\nwith a conviction\u201d is buttressed by the fact that Congress, like\nmost States, instructs courts calculating a term of imprisonment to\ncredit pretrial detention as time served on a subsequent\nconviction. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73585(b)(1); Tr. of Oral Arg.\n54 (statement of the Assistant Solicitor General representing that\nthe same rule applies in 45 States and the District of Columbia).\nThus, it makes sense that the phrase \u201cimprison[ment] in connection\nwith a conviction\u201d would include pretrial detention later credited\nas time served, especially since both provisions were passed as\npart of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. See \u00a7212(a)(2), 98Stat.\n2008\u20132009. If Congress intended a narrower interpretation, it could\nhave easily used narrower language, such as \u201caftera\nconviction\u201d or \u201cfollowinga conviction.\u201d Seee.g.,Bail Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7209(d)(4), 98Stat. 1987 (adding Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 46(h), allowing courts to direct\nforfeiture of property \u201cafterconviction of the offense\ncharged\u201d (emphasis added)). We cannot override Congress\u2019 choice to\nemploy the more capacious phrase \u201cin connection with.\u201dThird, the text undeniably requires courts to\nretrospectively calculate whether a period of pretrial detention\nshould toll a period of supervised release. Whereas \u00a73624(e)\ninstructs courts precisely when the supervised-release clock\nbegins\u2014\u201con the day the person is released\u201d\u2014the statute does not\nrequire courts to make a tolling determination as soon as a\ndefendant is arrested on new charges or to continually reassess the\ntolling calculation throughout the period of his pretrial\ndetention. Congress contemplated the opposite by including a\nminimum-incarceration threshold: tolling occurs \u201cunless the\nimprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\u201d\n\u00a73624(e). This calculation must be made after either release from\ncustody or entry of judgment; there is no way for a court to know\non day 5 of a defendant\u2019s pretrial detention whether the period of\ncustody will extend beyond 30 days. Thus, at least some uncertainty\nas to whether supervised release is tolled is built into \u00a73624(e)\nby legislative design. This fact confirms that courts should make\nthe tolling calculation upon the defendant\u2019s release from custody\nor upon entry of judgment.BThe statutory context also supports our\nreading. Supervised release is \u201ca form of postconfinement\nmonitoring\u201d that permits a defendant a kind of conditional liberty\nby allowing him to serve part of his sentence outside of prison.Johnsonv.United States,529\nU.S. 694, 697 (2000). Recognizing that Congress provided for\nsupervised release to facilitate a \u201ctransition to community life,\u201d\nwe have declined to offset a term of supervised release by the\namount of excess time a defendant spent in prison after two of his\nconvictions were declared invalid.United Statesv.Johnson,529 U.S.\n53, 59\u201360 (2000). As we explained: \u201cThe objectives of\nsupervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were\nto offset and reduce terms of supervised release\u201d because\n\u201c[s]upervised release has no statutory function until confinement\nends.\u201dId.,at 59. This understanding of supervised release\ninforms our reading of the tolling provision.Consider \u00a73624(e) itself. The sentence preceding\nthe one at issue here specifies that supervised release \u201cruns\nconcurrently\u201d with \u201cprobation or supervised release or parole foranotheroffense.\u201d \u00a73624(e) (emphasis added). But the next\nsentence (the one at issue here) excludes periods of\n\u201cimprison[ment]\u201d served \u201cin connection with a conviction.\u201d The\njuxtaposition of these two sentences reinforces the fact that\nprison time is \u201cnot interchange- able\u201d with supervised release.Id.,at 59. Permitting a period of probation or\nparole to count toward supervised release but excluding a period of\nincarceration furthers the statutory design of \u201csuccessful[ly]\ntransition[ing]\u201d a defendant from \u201cprison to liberty.\u201dJohnson,supra,at 708\u2013709. Allowing pretrial\ndetention credited toward another sentence to toll the period of\nsupervised release is consistent with that design. Cf. A. Scalia\n& B. Garner, Reading Law 167 (2012) (explaining that \u201cthe\nwhole-text canon\u201d requires consideration of \u201cthe entire text, in\nview of its structure\u201d and \u201clogical relation of its many\nparts\u201d).Second, it would be an exceedingly odd\nconstruction of the statute to give a defendant the windfall of\nsatisfying a new sentence of imprisonment and an old sentence of\nsupervised release with the same period of pretrial detention.\nSupervised release is a form of punishment that Congress prescribes\nalong with a term of imprisonment as part of the same sentence. See\ngenerally \u00a73583. And Congress denies defendants credit for time\nserved if the detention time has already \u201cbeen credited against\nanother sentence.\u201d \u00a73585(b). Yet Mont\u2019s reading of \u00a73624(e) would\ndeprive the Government of its lawfully imposed sentence of\nsupervised release while the defendant is serving a separate\nsentence of incarceration\u2014one often imposed by a different\nsovereign. Under our view, in contrast, time in pretrial detention\nconstitutes supervised release only if the charges against the\ndefendant are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted. This ensures\nthat the defendant is not faulted for conduct he might not have\ncommitted, while otherwise giving full effect to the lawful\njudgment previously imposed on the defendant.[1]CIn response to these points, Mont follows the\nD.\u00a0C. Circuit in arguing that the present tense of the statute\n(\u201c\u00a0\u2018isimprisoned\u2019\u00a0\u201d) forbids any backward looking\ntolling analysis. SeeMarsh, 829 F.\u00a03d, at 709. Mont\ncontends that, when a defendant is held in pretrial detention, a\ncourt cannot sayat that momentthat he \u201cis imprisoned in\nconnection with a conviction.\u201d He relies on the Dictionary Act,\nwhich provides that \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of\nCongress, unless the context indicates otherwise[,] words used in\nthe present tense include the future as well as the present.\u201d 1\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.Mont\u2019s argument confuses the rule (\u201cany period\nin which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\u201d)\nwith a court\u2019s analysis of whether that rule was satisfied. Of\ncourse, the determination whether supervised release has been\ntolled cannot be made at the exact moment when the defendant is\nheld in pretrial detention. Rather, the court must await the\noutcome of those separate proceedings before it will know whether\n\u201cimprison[ment]\u201d is tied to a conviction. But the statute does not\nrequire the court to make a contemporaneous assessment. Quite the\nopposite: As discussed, the statute undeniably contemplates that\nthere will be uncertainty about the status of supervised release\nwhen a defendant has been held for a short period of time and it is\nunclear whether the imprisonment will exceed 30 days. There is no\nreason the statute would preclude postponing calculation just\nbecause the custody period extends beyond 30 days. Once the court\nmakes the calculation, it will determine whether the relevant\nperiod ultimately qualified as a period \u201cin which the person is\nimprisoned in connection with a conviction\u201d for 30 or more days. In\nshort, the present-tense phrasing of the statute does not address\nwhether a judge must be able to make a supervised-release\ndetermination at any given time.Moreover, any uncertainty about whether\nsupervised release is tolled matters little from either the court\u2019s\nor the defendant\u2019s perspective. As for the court, the defendant\nneed not be supervised when he is held in custody, so it does not\nstrike us as \u201codd\u201d to make a delayed determination concerning\ntolling.Marsh,supra,at 710. The court need not\nmonitor the defendant\u2019s progress in transitioning back into the\ncommunity because the defendant is notinthe community. And\nif the court is concerned about losing authority over the defendant\nbecause of an impending conclusion to supervised release, it can\nsimply issue a summons or warrant under \u00a73583(i) for alleged\nviolations.As for the defendant, there is nothing unfair\nabout not knowing during pretrial detention whether he is also\nsubject to court supervision. The answer to that question cannot\nmeaningfully influence his behavior. A defendant in custody will be\nunable to comply with many ordinary conditions of supervised\nrelease intended to reacclimate him to society\u2014for example, making\nrestitution payments, attending substance-abuse counseling, meeting\ncurfews, or participating in job training. The rules he can\n\u201ccomply\u201d with are generally mandated by virtue of being in\nprison\u2014for example, no new offenses or use of drugs. See\n\u00a7\u00a73563(a)\u2013(b) (listing mandatory and discretionary conditions). In\nthis case, Mont\u2019s supervised-release conditions required that he\n\u201cwork regularly at a lawful occupation\u201d and \u201csupport his\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. dependants and meet other family responsibilities.\u201d\nJudgment in No. 4:05\u2013cr\u201300229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 37, at 111. Mont\ncould not fulfill these conditions while sitting in an Ohio jail,\nand his probation officer correctly deemed him \u201cunavailable for\nsupervision.\u201d[2] App. 21.IIIApplying \u00a73624(e) to Mont, the\npretrial-detention period tolled his supervised release beginning\nin June 2016. Mont therefore had about nine months remaining on his\nterm of supervised release when the District Court revoked his\nsupervised release and sentenced him to an additional 42 months\u2019\nimprisonment. And because \u00a73624(e) independently tolled the\nsupervised-release period, it is immaterial whether the District\nCourt could have issued a summons or warrant under \u00a73583(i) to\npreserve its authority.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In light of the statutory text and context of\n\u00a73624(e), pretrial detention qualifies as \u201cimprison[ment] in\nconnection with a conviction\u201d if a later imposed sentence credits\nthat detention as time served for the new offense. Such pretrial\ndetention tolls the supervised-release period, even though the\nDistrict Court may need to make the tolling determination after the\nconviction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit.It is so ordered.Notes1Our reading leaves intact\na district court\u2019s ability to preserve its authority by issuing an\narrest warrant or summons under \u00a73583(i) based on the conduct at\nissue in the new charges, irrespective of whether the defendant is\nlater convicted or acquitted of those offenses. But preserving\njurisdiction through \u00a73583(i) is not a prerequisite to a court\nmaintaining authority under \u00a73624(e), nor does it impact the\ntolling calculation under \u00a73624(e).2Although a defendant in\npretrial detention is unable to be supervised, it does not\nnecessarily follow that the defendant will be punished by his\ninability to comply with the terms of his supervised release if the\ndetention period isnotlater credited as time served for a\nconviction. In that circumstance, the district court may always\nmodify the terms of his supervision. See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73583(e)(2). And, as the Government explained at oral argument,\nmodification of supervised release may not be necessary to the\nextent that \u201cthe defendant can\u2019t be deemed to have been required\nto\u201d comply with the terms of supervised release while in custody.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 45.",
