S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-103REED ELSEVIER, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.IRVIN MUCHNICK et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit[March 2, 2010]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.Subject to certain exceptions,\nthe Copyright Act (Act) requires copyright holders to register\ntheir works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7411(a) (Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit held that a copyright holder\u2019s\nfailure to comply with \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement deprives\na federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)\u2019s registration\nrequirement is a precondition to filing a claim that does not\nrestrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction.IAThe Constitution grants Congress\nthe power \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by\nsecuring for limited Times to Authors \u2026 the exclusive Right to \u2026\ntheir \u2026 Writings.\u201d Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a08. Exercising this\npower, Congress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme\ngoverning the existence and scope of \u201c[c]opyright protection\u201d for\n\u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of\nexpression.\u201d 17 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(a). This scheme gives copyright\nowners \u201cthe exclusive rights\u201d (with specified statutory exceptions)\nto distribute, reproduce, or publicly perform their works. \u00a7106.\n\u201cAnyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright\nowner as provided\u201d in the Act \u201cis an infringer of the copyright.\u201d\n\u00a7501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright owner \u201cis\nentitled,subject to the requirements of section 411, to\ninstitute an action\u201d for copyright infringement. \u00a7501(b) (emphasis\nadded).This case concerns \u201cthe\nrequirements of section 411\u201d to which \u00a7501(b) refers. Section\n411(a) provides,inter aliaand with certain exceptions,\nthat \u201cno civil action for infringement of the copyright in any\nUnited States work shall be instituted until preregistration or\nregistration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance\nwith this title.\u201d[Footnote 1]\nThis provision is part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme. It establishes\na condition\u2014copyright registration\u2014that plaintiffs ordinarily must\nsatisfy before filing an infringement claim and invoking the Act\u2019s\nremedial provisions. We address whether \u00a7411(a) also deprives\nfederal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\ninfringement claims involving unregistered works.BThe relevant proceedings in this\ncase began after we issued our opinion inNew York Times\nCo.v.Tasini,533 U. S. 483(2001). InTasini, we agreed with the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit that several owners of online databases and print\npublishers had infringed the copyrights of six freelance authors by\nreproducing the authors\u2019 works electronically without first\nsecuring their permission. Seeid., at 493. In so holding,\nwe affirmed the principal theory of liability underlying copyright\ninfringement suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion inTasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision inTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict\nLitigation.The consolidated complaint\nalleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright,\ntypically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or a\nmagazine, that they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered their\ncopyrighted works and authors who had not. See App. 94.Because of the growing size and complexity of\nthe lawsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the publishers\n(and their insurers), and the electronic databases (and their\ninsurers) negotiated. Finally, in March 2005, they reached a\nsettlement agreement that the parties intended \u201cto achieve a global\npeace in the publishing industry.\u201dIn\u00a0re Literary Works in\nElectronic Databases Copyright Litigation, 509 F.\u00a03d 116,\n119 (CA2 2007).The parties moved the District Court to\ncertify a class for settlement and to approve the settlement\nagreement. Ten freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick\n(hereinafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court\noverruled the objections; certified a settlement class of freelance\nauthors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3);\napproved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under\nRule 23(e); and entered final judgment. At no time did the Muchnick\nrespondents or any other party urge the District Court to dismiss\nthe case, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the\nsettlement, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing\ntheir objections to the settlement on procedural and substantive\ngrounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of AppealssU.\nS.onteordered briefing on the question whether \u00a7411(a)\ndeprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over\ninfringement claims involving unregistered copyrights. All parties\nfiled briefs asserting that the District Court had subject-matter\njurisdiction to approve the settlement agreement even though it\nincluded unregistered works.Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509\nF.\u00a03d, at 121 (citingWell-Made Toy Mfg. Corp.v.Goffa Int\u2019l Corp., 354 F.\u00a03d 112, 114\u2013115 (CA2 2003);Morrisv.Business Concepts, Inc., 259 F.\u00a03d\n65, 72\u201373 (CA2 2001)), the Court of Appeals concluded that the\nDistrict Court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class of claims\narising from the infringement of unregistered works, and also\nlacked jurisdiction to approve a settlement with respect to those\nclaims, 509 F.\u00a03d, at 121 (citing \u201cwidespread agreement among\nthe circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional\u201d).[Footnote 2]Judge Walker dissented. He concluded \u201cthat\n\u00a7411(a) is more like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-numerosity\nrequirement inArbaugh[v.Y & H Corp.,546 U. S. 500(2006)]\u201d than the\njurisdictional statutory time limit inBowlesv.Russell,551 U. S. 205(2007). 509 F.\u00a03d,\nat 129. Accordingly, he reasoned that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration\nrequirement does not limit federal subject-matter jurisdiction over\ninfringement suits involving unregistered works.Ibid.We granted the owners\u2019 and publishers\u2019\npetition for a writ of certiorari, and formulated the question\npresented to ask whether \u00a7411(a) restricts the subject-matter\njurisdiction of the federal courts over copyright infringement\nactions. 555 U. S. ____ (2009). Because no party supports the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 jurisdictional holding, we appointed anamicus\ncuriaeto defend the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.[Footnote 3] 556 U. S. ____ (2009). We now\nreverse.IIA\u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201ca\ncourt\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201dKontrickv.Ryan,540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004).\nAccordingly, the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d properly applies only to\n\u201cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter\njurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\u201d implicating\nthat authority.Ibid.;see alsoSteel\nCo.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998)\n(\u201csubject-matter jurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201cthe courts\u2019 statutory or\nconstitutionalpowerto adjudicate the case\u201d (emphasis in\noriginal));Landgrafv.USI Film Products,511 U. S. 244,\n274 (1994) (\u201c[J]urisdictional statutes \u2018speak to the power of the\ncourt rather than to the rights or obligations of the\nparties\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingRepublic Nat. Bank of Miamiv.United States,506 U. S. 80, 100 (1992)\n(Thomas, J., concurring))).While perhaps clear in theory,\nthe distinction between jurisdictional conditions and\nclaim-processing rules can be confusing in practice.\nCourts\u2014including this Court\u2014have sometimes mischaracterized\nclaim-processing rules or elements of a cause of action as\njurisdictional limitations, particularly when that characterization\nwas not central to the case, and thus did not require close\nanalysis. SeeArbaugh,supra, at 511\u2013512 (citing\nexamples);Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 91 (same). Our recent\ncases evince a marked desire to curtail such \u201cdrive-by\njurisdictional rulings,\u201dibid.,which too easily can miss\nthe \u201ccritical difference[s]\u201d between true jurisdictional conditions\nand nonjurisdictional limitations on causes of action,Kontrick,supra, at 456; see alsoArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 511.In light of the important distinctions between\njurisdictional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see,e.g.,id., at 514, we have encouraged federal\ncourts and litigants to \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d clarity by using the term\n\u201cjurisdictional\u201d only when it is apposite,Kontrick,supra, at 455. InArbaugh, we described the\ngeneral approach to distinguish \u201cjurisdictional\u201d conditions from\nclaim-processing requirements or elements of a claim:\u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold\nlimitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed\nand will not be left to wrestle with the issue. But when Congress\ndoes not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,\ncourts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in\ncharacter.\u201d 546 U. S., at 515\u2013516 (citation and footnote\nomitted).The plaintiff inArbaughbrought a claim under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer . . .\nto discriminate,\u201dinter alia, on the basis of sex. 42 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). But employees can bring Title VII claims\nonly against employers that have \u201cfifteen or more employees.\u201d\n\u00a72000e(b).Arbaughaddressed whether that employee\nnumerosity requirement \u201caffects federal-court subject-matter\njurisdiction or, instead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a\nTitle VII claim for relief.\u201d 546 U. S., at 503. We held that it\ndoes the latter.Our holding turned principally\non our examination of the text of \u00a72000e(b), the section in which\nTitle VII\u2019s numerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does\nnot \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the employee numerosity threshold on\nTitle VII\u2019s scope \u201ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\u201dId., at\n515\u2013516, and n.\u00a011. And nothing in our prior Title VII cases\ncompelled the conclusion that even though the numerosity\nrequirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it nonetheless\nimposed a jurisdictional limit. Seeid., at 511\u2013513.\nSimilarly, \u00a72000e(b)\u2019s text and structure did not demonstrate that\nCongress \u201crank[ed]\u201d that requirement as jurisdictional. Seeid., at 513\u2013516. As we observed, the employee numerosity\nrequirement is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f)(3), Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction-granting section,\ndistinguishing it from the \u201camount-in-controversy threshold\ningredient of subject-matter jurisdiction \u2026 in\ndiversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71332.\u201dArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514\u2013515.Accordingly, the\nnumerosity requirement could not fairly be read to \u201c\u00a0\u2018speak in\njurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdiction of the\ndistrict courts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 515 (quotingZipesv.Trans World Airlines, Inc.,455 U. S. 385, 394\n(1982)). We thus \u201crefrain[ed] from\u201d construing the numerosity\nrequirement to \u201cconstric[t] \u00a71331 or Title VII\u2019s jurisdictional\nprovision.\u201dArbaugh, supra,at 515 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).We now apply this same\napproach to \u00a7411(a).BSection 411(a)\nprovides:\u201cExcept for an action brought for a\nviolation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a), and\nsubject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action for\ninfringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be\ninstituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright\nclaim has been made in accordance with this title. In any case,\nhowever, where the deposit, application, and fee required for\nregistration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper\nform and registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled\nto institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof,\nwith a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of\nCopyrights. The Register may, at his or her option, become a party\nto the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the\ncopyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after\nsuch service, but the Register\u2019s failure to become a party shall\nnot deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that\nissue.\u201dWe must consider\nwhether \u00a7411(a) \u201cclearly states\u201d that its registration requirement\nis \u201cjurisdictional.\u201dArbaugh,supra, at 515. It\ndoes not.Amicusdisagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the last sentence of\n\u00a7411(a) and contending that the use of the term there indicates the\njurisdictional cast of \u00a7411(a)\u2019s first sentence as well. Brief for\nCourt-AppointedAmicus Curiaein support of Judgment Below\n18 (hereinafterAmicusBrief). But this reference to\n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d cannot bear the weight thatamicusplaces\nupon it. The sentence upon whichamicusrelies\nstates:\u201cThe Register [of Copyrights] may,\nat his or her option, become a party to the [copyright\ninfringement] action with respect tothe issue of\nregistrability of the copyright claimby entering an\nappearance within sixty days after such service, but the Register\u2019s\nfailure to become a party shall not deprive the court of\njurisdiction to determinethat issue.\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis\nadded).Congress added\nthis sentence to the Act in 1976, 90 Stat. 2583, to clarify that a\nfederal court can determine \u201cthe issue of registrability of the\ncopyright claim\u201d even if the Register does not appear in the\ninfringement suit. That clarification was necessary because courts\nhad interpreted \u00a7411(a)\u2019s precursor provision,[Footnote 4] which imposed a similar registration\nrequirement, as prohibiting copyright owners who had beenrefusedregistration by the Register of Copyrights from\nsuing for infringement until the ownersfirstsought\nmandamus against the Register. SeeVacheron & Constantin-Le\nCoultre Watches, Inc.v.Benrus Watch Co., 260\nF.\u00a02d 637, 640\u2013641 (CA2 1958) (construing \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\nprecursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear that a federal court\nplainly has adjudicatory authority to determine \u201cthatissue,\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis added)\u2014i.e., the issue ofregistrability\u2014regardless of whether the Register is a\nparty to theinfringementsuit. The word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d\nas used here, thus says nothing about whether a federal court has\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement\nof unregistered works.Moreover, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\nregistration requirement, like Title VII\u2019s numerosity requirement,\nis located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from those granting federal\ncourts subject-matter jurisdiction over those respective claims.\nSeeArbaugh,supra, at 514\u2013515. Federal district\ncourts have subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71331 and 1338. But neither\n\u00a71331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over questions of\nfederal law, nor \u00a71338(a), which is specific to copyright claims,\nconditions its jurisdictional grant on whether copyright holders\nhave registered their works before suing for infringement. Cf.Arbaugh,supra,at 515 (\u201cTitle VII\u2019s\njurisdictional provision\u201d does not \u201cspecif[y] any threshold\ningredient akin to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332\u2019s monetary floor\u201d).Nor does any other factor\nsuggest that 17 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration\nrequirement can be read to \u201c\u00a0\u2018speak in jurisdictional terms or\nrefer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district\ncourts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dArbaugh,546 U. S., at 515 (quotingZipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most significantly,\n\u00a7411(a) expresslyallowscourts to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works in three circumstances: where\nthe work is not a U. S. work, where the infringement claim concerns\nrights of attribution and integrity under \u00a7106A, or where the\nholder attempted to register the work and registration was refused.\nSeparately, \u00a7411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the author\n\u201cdeclare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the work\u201d and\n\u201cmakes registration for the work, if required by subsection (a),\nwithin three months after [the work\u2019s] first transmission.\u201d 17 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7411(c)(1)\u2013(2). It would be at least unusual to ascribe\njurisdictional significance to a condition subject to these sorts\nof exceptions.[Footnote\n5]That the numerosity\nrequirement inArbaughcould be considered an element of a\nTitle VII claim, rather than a prerequisite to initiating a\nlawsuit, does not change this conclusion, as our decision inZipesdemonstrates.Zipes(upon whichArbaughrelied) held that Title VII\u2019s requirement that\nsex-discrimination claimants timely file a discrimination charge\nwith the EEOC before filing a civil action in federal court was\nnonjurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 393; 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1) (establishing specific time periods within which a\ndiscrimination claimant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge\nwith the EEOC). A statutory condition that requires a party to take\nsome action before filing a lawsuit is not automatically \u201cajurisdictionalprerequisite to suit.\u201dZipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional analysis\nmust focus on the \u201clegal character\u201d of the requirement,id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to the\ncondition\u2019s text, context, and relevant historical treatment,id., at 393\u2013395; see alsoNational Railroad Passenger\nCorporationv.Morgan,536 U. S. 101, 119\u2013121 (2002). We\nsimilarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types of\nthreshold requirements that claimants must complete, or exhaust,\nbefore filing a lawsuit.[Footnote\n6]The registration requirement\nin 17 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7411(a) fits in this mold. Section\n411(a) imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly\nlabeled jurisdictional, is not located in a jurisdiction-granting\nprovision, and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions. See\n\u00a7\u00a7411(a)\u2013(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of precondition to\nsuit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment under our\nprecedents.CAmicusinsists that our decision inBowles,551 U. S. 205, compels a conclusion\ncontrary to the one we reach today.AmicuscitesBowlesfor the proposition that where Congress did not\nexplicitly label a statutory condition as jurisdictional, a court\nnevertheless should treat it as such if that is how the condition\nconsistently has been interpreted and if Congress has not disturbed\nthat interpretation.AmicusBrief 26. Specifically,amicusrelies on a footnote inBowlesto argue\nthat here, as inBowles, it would be improper to\ncharacterize the statutory condition as nonjurisdictional because\ndoing so would override \u201c\u00a0\u2018a century\u2019s worth of\nprecedent\u2019\u00a0\u201d treating \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement as\njurisdictional.AmicusBrief 26 (quotingBowles,supra, at 209, n.\u00a02). This argument focuses on the\nresult inBowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.Bowlesdid not hold that any statutory condition devoid of an express\njurisdictional label should be treated as jurisdictional simply\nbecause courts have long treated it as such. Nor did it hold that\nall statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be considered\njurisdictional.[Footnote 7]\nRather,Bowlesstands for the proposition that context,\nincluding this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many\nyears past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as\njurisdictional.InBowles, we\nconsidered 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72107, which requires parties in a\ncivil action to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the\njudgment being appealed, and Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, which \u201ccarries \u00a72107 into practice.\u201d 551 U.\nS., at 208. After analyzing \u00a72107\u2019s specific language and this\nCourt\u2019s historical treatment of the type of limitation \u00a72107\nimposes (i.e., statutory deadlines for filing appeals), we\nconcluded that Congress had ranked the statutory condition as\njurisdictional. Our focus inBowleson the historical\ntreatment of statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus\nconsistent with theArbaughframework. Indeed,Bowlesemphasized that this Court had long treated such\nconditions as jurisdictional, including in statutesotherthan \u00a72107, and specifically in statutes that predated the creation\nof the courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and\nn.\u00a02.Bowlestherefore\ndemonstrates that the relevant question here is not (asamicusputs it) whether \u00a7411(a) itself has long been\nlabeled jurisdictional, but whether the type of limitation that\n\u00a7411(a) imposes is one that is properly ranked as jurisdictional\nabsent an express designation. The statutory limitation inBowleswas of a type that we had long helddid\u201cspeak in jurisdictional terms\u201d even absent a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d\nlabel, and nothing about \u00a72107\u2019s text or context, or the historical\ntreatment of that type of limitation, justified a departure from\nthis view. That was not the case, however, for the types of\nconditions inZipesandArbaugh.Here, that same analysis leads\nus to conclude that \u00a7411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter\njurisdiction of federal courts. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s historical\ntreatment as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a factor in the analysis, it is\nnot dispositive. The other factors discussed above demonstrate that\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is more analogous to the\nnonjurisdictional conditions we considered inZipesandArbaughthan to the statutory time limit at issue inBowles.[Footnote 8] We\nthus conclude that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is\nnonjurisdictional, notwithstanding its prior jurisdictional\ntreatment.[Footnote\n9]IIIAmicusargues that even if \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional, we should\nnonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment vacating the District Court\u2019s order approving the\nsettlement and dismissing the case. According toamicus,\npetitioners asserted previously in these proceedings that copyright\nregistration was jurisdictional, and this assertion should estop\nthem from now asserting a right to waive objections to the authors\u2019\nfailure to register.Amicusurges us to prevent the\nparties \u201cfrom \u2018playing fast and loose with the courts\u2019 by\n\u2018deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the\nmoment.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmicusBrief 58 (quotingNew\nHampshirev.Maine,532 U. S. 742, 750\n(2001)).We agree that\nsome statements in the parties\u2019 submissions to the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals are in tension with their arguments here.\nBut we decline to apply judicial estoppel. As we explained inNew Hampshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among\nother things, a \u201cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance\nof an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the\nperception that either the first or the second court was misled.\u201dId., at 750 (internal quotation marks omitted).Such circumstances do not\nexist here for two reasons. First, the parties made their prior\nstatements when negotiating or defending the settlement agreement.\nWe do not fault the parties\u2019 lawyers for invoking in the\nnegotiations binding Circuit precedent that supported their\nclients\u2019 positions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\u2019\ninterpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when the Court\nof Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether \u00a7411(a) restricted\nthe District Court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, they argued that\nit did not, and the Court of Appeals rejected their arguments. See\nApp. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 3a\u20135a, and n.\u00a02. Accepting\npetitioners\u2019 arguments here thus cannot create \u201cinconsistent court\ndeterminations\u201d in their favor.New Hampshire,supra, at 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\ntherefore hold that the District Court had authority to adjudicate\nthe parties\u2019 request to approve their settlement.IVOur holding that\n\u00a7411(a) does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction precludes the need for us to address the parties\u2019\nalternative arguments as to whether the District Court had\nauthority to approve the settlement even under the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 erroneous reading of \u00a7411. In concluding that the District\nCourt had jurisdiction to approve the settlement, we express no\nopinion on the settlement\u2019s merits.We also decline\nto address whether \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a\nmandatory precondition to suit that\u2014like the threshold conditions\ninArizonav.California,530 U.
