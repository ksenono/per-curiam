GLOSSIP, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.KEVIN J. GROSS, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the tenth circuit[June 29, 2015]Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Prisoners sentenced to death in the State of\nOklahoma filed an action in federal court under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, contending that the method of\nexecution now used by the State violates the Eighth Amendment\nbecause it creates an unacceptable risk of severe pain. They argue\nthat midazolam, the first drug employed in the State\u2019s current\nthree-drug protocol, fails to render a person insensate to pain.\nAfter holding an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied\nfour prisoners\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction, finding\nthat they had failed to prove that midazolam is ineffective. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed and accepted the\nDistrict Court\u2019s finding of fact regarding midazolam\u2019s\nefficacy.For two independent reasons, we also affirm.\nFirst, the prisoners failed to identify a known and available\nalternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\na requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims.\nSeeBazev.Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, 61 (2008)\n(plurality opinion). Second, the District Court did not commit\nclear error when it found that the prisoners failed to establish\nthat Oklahoma\u2019s use of a massive dose of midazolam in its execution\nprotocol entails a substantial risk of severe pain.IAThe death penalty was an accepted punishment\nat the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of\nRights. In that era, death sentences were usually carried out by\nhanging. The Death Penalty in America: Current Controversies 4 (H.\nBedau ed. 1997). Hanging remained the standard method of execution\nthrough much of the 19th century, but that began to change in the\ncentury\u2019s later years. SeeBaze,supra,at 41\u201342. In\nthe 1880\u2019s, the Legislature of the State of New York appointed a\ncommission to find \u201c\u00a0\u2018the most humane and practical method\nknown to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence of\ndeath in capital cases.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn re Kemmler, 136\nU.\u00a0S. 436, 444 (1890) . The commission recommended\nelectrocution, and in 1888, the Legislature enacted a law providing\nfor this method of execution.Id.,at 444\u2013445. In subsequent\nyears, other States followed New York\u2019s lead in the \u201c\u00a0\u2018belief\nthat electrocution is less painful and more humane than\nhanging.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBaze,553 U.\u00a0S., at 42 (quotingMalloyv.South Carolina, 237 U.\u00a0S. 180, 185\n(1915) ).In 1921, the Nevada Legislature adopted another\nnew method of execution, lethal gas, after concluding that this was\n\u201cthe most humane manner known to modern science.\u201dStatev.Jon, 46 Nev. 418, 437, 211 P. 676, 682 (1923). The Nevada\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that the use of lethal gas was\nunconstitutional,id.,at 435\u2013437, 211 P., at 681\u2013682, and\nother States followed Nevada\u2019s lead, see,e.g., Ariz.\nConst., Art. XXII, \u00a722 (1933); 1937 Cal. Stats. ch. 172, \u00a71; 1933\nColo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, \u00a71; 1955 Md. Laws ch. 625, \u00a71, p. 1017;\n1937 Mo. Laws p. 222, \u00a71. Nevertheless, hanging and the firing\nsquad were retained in some States, see,e.g., 1961 Del.\nLaws ch. 309, \u00a72 (hanging); 1935 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 155, \u00a71\n(hanging); Utah Code Crim. Proc. \u00a7105\u201337\u201316 (1933) (hanging or\nfiring squad), and electrocution remained the predominant method of\nexecution until the 9-year hiatus in executions that ended with our\njudgment inGreggv.Georgia, 428 U.\u00a0S. 153\n(1976) . SeeBaze,supra,at 42.AfterGreggreaffirmed that the death\npenalty does not violate the Constitution, some States once again\nsought a more humane way to carry out death sentences. They\neventually adopted lethal injection, which today is \u201cby far the\nmost prevalent method of execution in the United States.\u201dBaze,supra, at 42. Oklahoma adopted lethal injection\nin 1977, see 1977 Okla. Sess. Laws p. 89, and it eventually settled\non a protocol that called for the use of three drugs:\n(1)\u00a0sodium thiopental, \u201ca fast-acting barbiturate sedative\nthat induces a deep, comalike unconsciousness when given in the\namounts used for lethal injection,\u201d (2)\u00a0a paralytic agent,\nwhich \u201cinhibits all muscular-skeletal movements and, by paralyzing\nthe diaphragm, stops respiration,\u201d and (3)\u00a0potassium chloride,\nwhich \u201cinterferes with the electrical signals that stimulate the\ncontractions of the heart, inducing cardiac arrest.\u201dBaze,supra, at 44; see also Brief for Respondents 9. By 2008, at\nleast 30 of the 36 States that used lethal injection employed that\nparticular three-drug protocol. 553 U.\u00a0S., at 44.While methods of execution have changed over the\nyears, \u201c[t]his Court has never invalidated a State\u2019s chosen\nprocedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of\ncruel and unusual punishment.\u201dId.,at 48. InWilkersonv.Utah, 99 U.\u00a0S. 130 \u2013135 (1879), the\nCourt upheld a sentence of death by firing squad. InIn re\nKemmler,supra, at 447\u2013449, the Court rejected a\nchallenge to the use of the electric chair. And the Court did not\nretreat from that holding even when presented with a case in which\na State\u2019s initial attempt to execute a pris-oner by electrocution\nwas unsuccessful.Louisiana ex rel. Francisv.Resweber, 329 U.\u00a0S. 459 \u2013464 (1947) (plurality\nopinion). Most recently, inBaze,supra, seven\nJustices agreed that the three-drug protocol just discussed does\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment.Our decisions in this area have been animated in\npart by the recognition that because it is settled that capital\npunishment is constitutional, \u201c[i]t necessarily follows that there\nmust be a [constitutional] means of carrying it out.\u201dId.,at 47. And because some risk of pain is inherent in any method of\nexecution, we have held that the Constitution does not require the\navoidance of all risk of pain.Ibid.After all, while most\nhumans wish to die a painless death, many do not have that good\nfortune. Holding that the Eighth Amendment demands the elimination\nof essentially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death\npenalty altogether.BBazecleared any legal obstacle to use\nof the most common three-drug protocol that had enabled States to\ncarry out the death penalty in a quick and painless fashion. But a\npractical obstacle soon emerged, as anti-death-penalty advocates\npressured pharmaceutical companies to refuse to supply the drugs\nused to carry out death sentences. The sole American manufacturer\nof sodium thiopental, the first drug used in the standard\nthree-drug protocol, was persuaded to cease production of the drug.\nAfter suspending domestic production in 2009, the company planned\nto resume production in Italy. Koppel, Execution Drug Halt Raises\nIre of Doctors, Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2011, p. A6.\nActivists then pressured both the company and the Italian\nGovernment to stop the sale of sodium thiopental for use in lethal\ninjections in this country. Bonner, Letter from Europe: Drug\nCompany in Cross Hairs of Death Penalty Opponents, N.\u00a0Y.\nTimes, Mar. 30, 2011; Koppel, Drug Halt Hinders Executions in the\nU.\u00a0S., Wall Street Journal, Jan. 22, 2011, p. A1. That effort\nproved successful, and in January 2011, the company announced that\nit would exit the sodium thiopental market entirely. See Hospira,\nPress Release, Hospira Statement Regarding PentothalTM (sodium\nthiopental) Market Exit (Jan. 21, 2011).After other efforts to procure sodium thiopental\nproved unsuccessful, States sought an alternative, and they\neventually replaced sodium thiopental with pentobarbital, another\nbarbiturate. In December 2010, Oklahoma became the first State to\nexecute an inmate using pentobarbital. See Reuters, Chicago\nTribune, New Drug Mix Used in Oklahoma Execution, Dec. 17 2010, p.\n41. That execution occurred without incident, and States gradually\nshifted to pentobarbital as their supplies of sodium thiopentalran\nout. It is reported that pentobarbital was used in all of the 43\nexecutions carried out in 2012. The Death Penalty Institute,\nExecution List 2012, online at\nwww.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2012 (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2015, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). Petitioners concede that pentobarbital, like\nsodium thiopental, can \u201creliably induce and maintain a comalike\nstate that renders a person insensate to pain\u201d caused by\nadministration of the second and third drugs in the protocol. Brief\nfor Petitioners 2. And courts across the country have held that the\nuse of pentobarbital in executions does not violate the Eighth\nAmendment. See,e.g., Jacksonv.Danberg, 656\nF.\u00a03d 157 (CA3 2011);Beatyv.Brewer, 649\nF.\u00a03d 1071 (CA9 2011);DeYoungv.Owens, 646\nF.\u00a03d 1319 (CA11 2011);Pavattv.Jones, 627\nF.\u00a03d 1336 (CA10 2010).Before long, however, pentobarbital also became\nunavailable. Anti-death-penalty advocates lobbied the Danish\nmanufacturer of the drug to stop selling it for use in executions.\nSee Bonner,supra. That manufacturer opposed the death\npenalty and took steps to block the shipment of pentobarbital for\nuse in executions in the United States. Stein, New Obstacle to\nDeath Penalty in U.\u00a0S., Washington Post, July 3, 2011, p. A4.\nOklahoma eventually became unable to acquire the drug through any\nmeans. The District Court below found that both sodium thiopental\nand pentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma. App. 67\u201368.CUnable to acquire either sodium thiopental or\npentobarbital, some States have turned to midazolam, a sedative in\nthe benzodiazepine family of drugs. In October 2013, Florida became\nthe first State to substitute midazolam for pentobarbital as part\nof a three-drug lethal injection protocol. Fernandez, Executions\nStall As States Seek Different Drugs, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Nov. 9,\n2013, p. A1. To date, Florida has conducted 11 executions using\nthat protocol, which calls for midazolam followed by a paralytic\nagent and potassium chloride. See Brief for State of Florida asAmicus Curiae2\u20133;Chavezv.Florida SP\nWarden, 742 F.\u00a03d 1267, 1269 (CA11 2014). In 2014,\nOklahoma also substituted midazolam for pentobarbital as part of\nits three-drug protocol. Oklahoma has already used this three-drug\nprotocol twice: to execute Clayton Lockett in April 2014 and\nCharles Warner in January 2015. (Warner was one of the four inmates\nwho moved for a preliminary injunction in this case.)The Lockett execution caused Oklahoma to\nimplement new safety precautions as part of its lethal injection\nprotocol. When Oklahoma executed Lockett, its protocol called for\nthe administration of 100 milligrams of midazolam, as compared to\nthe 500 milligrams that are currently required. On the morning of\nhis execution, Lockett cut himself twice at \u201c\u00a0\u2018the bend of the\nelbow.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. 50. That evening, the execution team spent\nnearly an hour making at least one dozen attempts to establish\nintravenous (IV) access to Lockett\u2019s cardiovascular system,\nincluding at his arms and elsewhere on his body. The team\neventually believed that it had established intravenous access\nthrough Lockett\u2019s right femoral vein, and it covered the injection\naccess point with a sheet, in part to preserve Lockett\u2019s dignity\nduring the execution. After the team administered the midazolam and\na physician determined that Lockett was unconscious, the team next\nadministered the paralytic agent (vecuronium bromide) and most of\nthe potassium chloride. Lockett began to move and speak, at which\npoint the physician lifted the sheet and determined that the IV had\n\u201cinfiltrated,\u201d which means that \u201cthe IV fluid, rather than entering\nLockett\u2019s blood stream, had leaked into the tissue surrounding the\nIV access point.\u201dWarnerv.Gross, 776 F.\u00a03d\n721, 725 (CA10 2015) (case below). The execution team stopped\nadministering the remaining potassium chloride and terminated the\nexecution about 33 minutes after the midazolam was first injected.\nAbout 10 minutes later, Lockett was pronounced dead.An investigation into the Lockett execution\nconcluded that \u201cthe viability of the IV access point was the single\ngreatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering\nthe execution drugs.\u201d App. 398. The investigation, which took five\nmonths to complete, recommended several changes to Oklahoma\u2019s\nexecution protocol, and Oklahoma adopted a new protocol with an\neffective date of September 30, 2014. That protocol allows the\nOklahoma Department of Corrections to choose among four different\ndrug combinations. The option that Oklahoma plans to use to execute\npetitioners calls for the administration of 500 milligrams of\nmidazolam followed by a paralytic agent and potassium\nchloride.[1] The paralytic\nagent may be pancuronium bromide, vecuronium bromide, or rocuronium\nbromide, three drugs that, all agree, are functionally equivalent\nfor purposes of this case. The protocol also includes procedural\nsafeguards to help ensure that an inmate remains insensate to any\npain caused by the administration of the paralytic agent and\npotassium chloride. Those safeguards include: (1)\u00a0the\ninsertion of both a primary and backup IV catheter,\n(2)\u00a0procedures to confirm the viability of the IV site,\n(3)\u00a0the option to postpone an execution if viable IV sites\ncannot be established within an hour, (4)\u00a0a mandatory pause\nbetween administration of the first and second drugs,\n(5)\u00a0numerous procedures for monitoring the offender\u2019s\nconsciousness, including the use of an electrocardiograph and\ndirect observation, and (6)\u00a0detailed provisions with respect\nto the training and preparation of the execution team. In January\nof this year, Oklahoma executed Warner using these revised\nprocedures and the combination of midazolam, a paralytic agent, and\npotassium chloride.IIAIn June 2014, after Oklahoma switched from\npentobarbital to midazolam and executed Lockett, 21 Oklahoma death\nrow inmates filed an action under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983\nchallenging the State\u2019s new lethal injection protocol. The\ncomplaint alleged that Oklahoma\u2019s use of midazolam violates the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.In November 2014, four of those\nplaintiffs\u2014RichardGlossip, Benjamin Cole, John Grant, and\nWarner\u2014filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. All four men\nhad been convicted of murder and sentenced to death by Oklahoma\njuries. Glossip hired Justin Sneed to kill his employer, Barry Van\nTreese. Sneed entered a room where Van Treese was sleeping and beat\nhim to death with a baseball bat. SeeGlossipv.State, 2007 OK CR 12, 157 P.\u00a03d 143, 147\u2013149. Cole\nmurdered his 9-month-old daughter after she would not stop crying.\nCole bent her body backwards until he snapped her spine in half.\nAfter the child died, Cole played video games. SeeColev.State, 2007 OK CR 27, 164 P.\u00a03d 1089, 1092\u20131093. Grant,\nwhile serving terms of imprisonment totaling 130 years, killed Gay\nCarter, a prison food service supervisor, by pulling her into a mop\ncloset and stabbing her numerous times with a shank. SeeGrantv.State, 2002 OK CR 36, 58 P.\u00a03d 783,\n789. Warner anally raped and murdered an 11-month-old girl. The\nchild\u2019s injuries included two skull fractures, internal brain\ninjuries, two fractures to her jaw, a lacerated liver, and a\nbruised spleen and lungs. SeeWarnerv.State, 2006\nOK CR 40, 144 P.\u00a03d 838, 856\u2013857.The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed\nthe murder conviction and death sentence of each offender. Each of\nthe men then unsuccessfully sought both state postconviction and\nfederal habeas corpus relief. Having exhausted the avenues for\nchallenging their convictions and sentences, they moved for a\npreliminary injunction against Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection\nprotocol.BIn December 2014, after discovery, the\nDistrict Court held a 3-day evidentiary hearing on the preliminary\ninjunction motion. The District Court heard testimony from 17\nwitnesses and reviewed numerous exhibits. Dr. David Lubarsky, an\nanesthesiologist, and Dr. Larry Sasich, a doctor of pharmacy,\nprovided expert testimony about midazolam for petitioners, and Dr.\nRoswell Evans, adoctor of pharmacy, provided expert testimony\nforrespondents.After reviewing the evidence, the District Court\nissued an oral ruling denying the motion for a preliminary\ninjunction. The District Court first rejected petitioners\u2019\nchallenge underDaubertv.Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., 509 U.\u00a0S. 579 (1993) , to the testimony of Dr.\nEvans. It concluded that Dr. Evans, the Dean of Auburn University\u2019s\nSchool of Pharmacy, was well qualified to testify about midazolam\u2019s\nproperties and that he offered reliable testimony. The District\nCourt then held that petitioners failed to establish a likelihood\nof success on the merits of their claim that the use of midazolam\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. The court provided two independent\nreasons for this conclusion. First, the court held that petitioners\nfailed to identify a known and available method of execution that\npresented a substantially less severe risk of pain than the method\nthat the State proposed to use. Second, the court found that\npetitioners failed to prove that Oklahoma\u2019s protocol \u201cpresents a\nrisk that is \u2018sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering,\u2019 amounting to \u2018an objectively intolerable risk\nof harm.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. 96 (quotingBaze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at\n50). The court emphasized that the Oklahoma protocol featured\nnumerous safeguards, including the establishment of two IV access\nsites, confirmation of the viability of those sites, and monitoring\nof the offender\u2019s level of consciousness throughout the\nprocedure.The District Court supported its decision with\nfindings of fact about midazolam. It found that a 500-milligram\ndose of midazolam \u201cwould make it a virtual certainty that any\nindividual will be at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to\nresist the noxious stimuli which could occur from the application\nof the second and third drugs.\u201d App. 77. Indeed, it found that a\n500-milligram dose alone would likely cause death by respiratory\narrest within 30 minutes or an hour.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\naffirmed. 776 F.\u00a03d 721. The Court of Appeals explained that\nour decision inBazerequires a plaintiff challenging a\nlethal injection protocol to demonstrate that the risk of severe\npain presented by an execution protocol is substantial \u201c\u00a0\u2018when\ncompared to the known and available alternatives.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 732 (quotingBaze,supra, at 61). And\nit agreed with the District Court that petitioners had not\nidentified any such alternative. The Court of Appeals added,\nhowever, that this holding was \u201cnot outcome-determinative in this\ncase\u201d because petitioners additionally failed to establish that the\nuse of midazolam creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. 776\nF.\u00a03d, at 732. The Court of Appeals found that the District\nCourt did not abuse its discretion by relying on Dr. Evans\u2019\ntestimony, and it concluded that the District Court\u2019s factual\nfindings about midazolam were not clearly erroneous. It also held\nthat alleged errors in Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony did not render his\ntestimony unreliable or the District Court\u2019s findings clearly\nerroneous.Oklahoma executed Warner on January 15, 2015,\nbut we subsequently voted to grant review and then stayed the\nexecutions of Glossip, Cole, and Grant pending the resolution of\nthis case. 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).III\u201cA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction\nmust establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he\nis likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an\ninjunction is in the public interest.\u201dWinterv.Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 7, 20 (2008) .\nThe parties agree that this case turns on whether petitioners are\nable to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the infliction\nof \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d The controlling opinion inBazeoutlined what a prisoner must establish to succeed on\nan Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim.Bazeinvolved\na challenge by Kentucky death row inmates to that State\u2019s\nthree-drug lethal injection protocol of sodium thiopental,\npancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. The inmates conceded\nthat the protocol, if properly administered, would result in a\nhumane and constitutional execution because sodium thiopental would\nrender an inmate oblivious to any pain caused by the second and\nthird drugs. 553 U.\u00a0S., at 49. But they argued that there was\nan unacceptable risk that sodium thiopental would not be properly\nadministered.Ibid.The inmates also maintained that a\nsignificant risk of harm could be eliminated if Kentucky adopted a\none-drug protocol and additional monitoring by trained personnel.Id.,at 51.The controlling opinion inBazefirst\nconcluded that prisoners cannot successfully challenge a method of\nexecution unless they establish that the method presents a risk\nthat is \u201c\u00a0\u2018sure or very likelyto cause serious illness\nand needless suffering,\u2019 and give rise to \u2018sufficientlyimminentdangers.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 50 (quotingHellingv.McKinney, 509 U.\u00a0S. 25 \u201335 (1993)).\nTo prevail on such a claim, \u201cthere must be a \u2018substantial risk of\nserious harm,\u2019 an \u2018objectively intolerable risk of harm\u2019 that\nprevents prison officials from pleading that they were\n\u2018subjectively blameless for purposes of the Eighth\nAmendment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 553 U.\u00a0S., at 50 (quotingFarmerv.Brennan, 511 U.\u00a0S. 825 , and n.\u00a09 (1994)). The\ncontrolling opinion also stated that prisoners \u201ccannot successfully\nchallenge a State\u2019s method of execution merely by showing a\nslightly or marginally safer alternative.\u201d 553 U.\u00a0S., at 51.\nInstead, prisoners must identify an alternative that is \u201cfeasible,\nreadily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce[s] a\nsubstantial risk of severe pain.\u201dId.,at 52.The controlling opinion summarized the\nrequirements of an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim as\nfollows: \u201cA stay of execution may not be granted on grounds such as\nthose asserted here unless the condemned prisoner establishes that\nthe State\u2019s lethal injection protocol creates a demonstrated risk\nof severe pain. [And] [h]e must show that the risk is substantial\nwhen compared to the known and available alternatives.\u201dId.,at 61. The preliminary injunction posture of the present case thus\nrequires petitioners to establish a likelihood that they can\nestablish both that Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection protocol creates a\ndemonstrated risk of severe pain and that the risk is substantial\nwhen compared to the known and available alternatives.The challenge inBazefailed both because\nthe Kentucky inmates did not show that the risks they identified\nwere substantial and imminent,id.,at 56, and because they\ndid not establish the existence of a known and available\nalternative method of execution that would entail a significantly\nless severe risk,id.,at 57\u201360. Petitioners\u2019 argumentshere\nfail for similar reasons. First, petitioners have not proved that\nany risk posed by midazolam is substantial when compared to known\nand available alternative methods of execution. Second, they have\nfailed to establish that the District Court committed clear error\nwhen it found that the use of midazolam will not result in severe\npain and suffering. We address each reason in turn.IVOur first ground for affirmance is based on\npetitioners\u2019 failure to satisfy their burden of establishing that\nany risk of harm was substantial when compared to a known and\navailable alternative method of execution. In their amended\ncomplaint, petitioners proffered that the State could use sodium\nthiopental as part of a single-drug protocol. They have since\nsuggested that it might also be constitutional for Oklahoma to use\npentobarbital. But the District Court found that both sodium\nthiopental and pentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma\u2019s\nDepartment of Corrections. The Court of Appeals affirmed that\nfinding, and it is not clearly erroneous. On the contrary, the\nrecord shows that Oklahoma has been unable to procure those drugs\ndespite a good-faith effort to do so.Petitioners do not seriously contest this\nfactual finding, and they have not identified any available drug or\ndrugs that could be used in place of those that Oklahoma is now\nunable to obtain. Nor have they shown a risk of pain so great that\nother acceptable, available methods must be used. Instead, they\nargue that they need not identify a known and available method of\nexecution that presents less risk. But this argument is\ninconsistent with the controlling opinion inBaze, 553\nU.\u00a0S., at 61, which imposed a requirement that the Court now\nfollows.[2]Petitioners contend that the requirement to\nidentify an alternative method of execution contravenes our\npre-Bazedecision inHillv.McDonough, 547\nU.\u00a0S. 573 (2006) , but they misread that decision. The portion\nof the opinion inHillon which they rely concerned a\nquestion of civil procedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment\nquestion. InHill, the issue was whether a challenge\nto a method of execution must be brought by means of an application\nfor a writ of habeas corpus or a civil action under \u00a71983.Id.,at 576. We held that a method-of-execution claim must\nbe brought under \u00a71983 because such a claim does not attack the\nvalidity of the prisoner\u2019s conviction or death sentence.Id.,at 579\u2013580. The United States asamicus curiaeargued that we should adopt a special pleading requirement to stop\ninmates from using \u00a71983 actions to attack, not just a particular\nmeans of execution, but the death penalty itself. To achieve this\nend, the United States proposed that an inmate asserting a\nmethod-of-execution claim should be required to plead an acceptable\nalternative method of execution.Id., at 582. We rejected\nthat argument because \u201c[s]pecific pleading requirements are\nmandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a\ngeneral rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal\ncourts.\u201dIbid.Hillthus held that \u00a71983 alone does\nnot impose a heightened pleading requirement.Baze,on the\nother hand, addressed the substantive elements of an Eighth\nAmendment method-of-execution claim, and it made clear that the\nEighth Amendment requires a prisoner to plead and prove a known and\navailable alternative. Because petitioners failed to do this, the\nDistrict Court properly held that they did not establish a\nlikelihood of success on their Eighth Amendment claim.Readers can judge for themselves how much\ndistance there is between the principal dissent\u2019s argument against\nrequiring prisoners to identify an alternative and the view, now\nannounced by Justices Breyer and Ginsburg, that the death penalty\nis categorically unconstitutional.Post,p. ___ (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). The principal dissent goes out of its way to suggest\nthat a State would violate the Eighth Amendment if it used one of\nthe methods of execution employed before the advent of lethal\ninjection.Post,at 30\u201331. And the principal dissent makes\nthis suggestion even though the Court held inWilkersonthat\nthis method (the firing squad) is constitutional and even though,\nin the words of the principal dissent, \u201cthere is some reason to\nthink that it is relatively quick and painless.\u201dPost, at\n30. Tellingly silent about the methods of execution most commonly\nused before States switched to lethal injection (the electric chair\nand gas chamber), the principal dissent implies that it would be\nunconstitutional to use a method that \u201ccould be seen as a\ndevolution to a more primitive era.\u201dIbid.If States cannot\nreturn to any of the \u201cmore primitive\u201d methods used in the past and\nif no drug that meets with the principal dissent\u2019s approval is\navailable for use in carrying out a death sentence, the logical\nconclusion is clear. But we have time and again reaffirmed that\ncapital punishment is notper\u00a0seunconstitutional. See,e.g.,Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47;id.,at\n87\u201388 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);Gregg, 428\nU.\u00a0S., at 187 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\nJJ.);id.,at 226 (White, J., concurring in judgment);Resweber, 329 U.\u00a0S., at 464;In re Kemmler, 136\nU.\u00a0S., at 447;Wilkerson, 99 U.\u00a0S., at 134\u2013135. We\ndecline to effectively overrule these decisions.VWe also affirm for a second reason: The\nDistrict Court did not commit clear error when it found that\nmidazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain\nduring an execution. We emphasize four points at the outset of our\nanalysis.First, we review the District Court\u2019s factual\nfindings under the deferential \u201cclear error\u201d standard. This\nstandard does not entitle us to overturn a finding \u201csimply because\n[we are] convinced that [we] would have decided the case\ndifferently.\u201dAndersonv.Bessemer City, 470\nU.\u00a0S. 564, 573 (1985) .Second, petitioners bear the burden of\npersuasion on this issue.Baze,supra,at 41.\nAlthough petitionersexpend great effort attacking peripheral\naspects of Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony, they make little attempt to prove\nwhat is critical,i.e., that the evidence they presented to\nthe District Court establishes that the use of midazolam is sure or\nvery likely to result in needless suffering.Third, numerous courts have concluded that the\nuse of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is\nlikely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might result from\nadministration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride. See,e.g.,776 F.\u00a03d 721 (case below affirming the District\nCourt);Chavezv.Florida SP Warden, 742 F.\u00a03d\n1267 (affirming the District Court);Banksv.State,\n150 So. 3d 797 (Fla. 2014) (affirming the lower court);Howellv.State, 133 So. 3d 511 (Fla. 2014) (same);Muhammadv.State, 132 So. 3d 176 (Fla. 2013) (same).\n(It is noteworthy that one or both of the two key witnesses in this\ncase\u2014Dr. Lubarsky for petitioners and Dr. Evans for\nrespondents\u2014were witnesses in theChavez,Howell, andMuhammadcases.) \u201cWhere an intermediate court reviews, and\naffirms, a trial court\u2019s factual findings, this Court will not\n\u2018lightly overturn\u2019 the concurrent findings of the two lower\ncourts.\u201dEasleyv.Cromartie, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 242\n(2001) . Our review is even more deferential where, as here,\nmultiple trial courts have reached the same finding, and multiple\nappellate courts have affirmed those findings. Cf.Exxon Co., U.\nS. A.v.Sofec, Inc., 517 U.\u00a0S. 830, 841 (1996)\n(explaining that this Court \u201c\u00a0\u2018cannot undertake to review\nconcurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a\nvery obvious and exceptional showing of error\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingGraver Tank & Mfg. Co.v.Linde Air Products Co.,\n336 U.\u00a0S. 271, 275 (1949) )).Fourth, challenges to lethal injection protocols\ntest the boundaries of the authority and competency of federal\ncourts. Although we must invalidate a lethal injection protocol if\nit violates the Eighth Amendment, federal courts should not\n\u201cembroil [themselves] in ongoing scientific controversies beyond\ntheir expertise.\u201dBaze,supra, at 51. Accordingly, an\ninmate challenging a protocol bears the burden to show, based on\nevidence presented to the court, that there is a substantial risk\nof severe pain.APetitioners attack the District Court\u2019s\nfindings of fact on two main grounds.[3] First, they argue that even if midazolam is powerful\nenough to induce unconsciousness, it is too weak to maintain\nunconsciousness and insensitivity to pain once the second and third\ndrugs are administered. Second, while conceding that the\n500-milligram dose of midazolam is much higher than the normal\ntherapeutic dose, they contend that this fact is irrelevant because\nmidazolam has a \u201cceiling effect\u201d\u2014that is, at a certain point, an\nincrease in the dose administered will not have any greater effect\non the inmate. Neither argumentsucceeds.The District Court found that midazolam is\ncapable of placing a person \u201cat a sufficient level of\nunconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur\nfrom theapplication of the second and third drugs.\u201d App.\n77. This conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Respondents\u2019 expert,\nDr. Evans, testified that the proper administration of a\n500-milligram dose of midazolam would make it \u201ca virtual certainty\u201d\nthat any individual would be \u201cat a sufficient level of\nunconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur\nfrom application of the 2nd and 3rd drugs\u201d used in the Oklahoma\nprotocol.Id.,at 302; see alsoid., at 322. And\npetitioners\u2019 experts acknowledged that they had no contrary\nscientific proof. Seeid.,at 243\u2013244 (Dr. Sasich stating\nthat the ability of midazolam to render a person insensate to the\nsecond and third drugs \u201chas not been subjected to scientific\ntesting\u201d);id., at 176 (Dr. Lubarksy stating that \u201cthere is\nno scientific literature addressing the use of midazolam as a\nmanner to administer lethal injections in humans\u201d).In an effort to explain this dearth of evidence,\nDr. Sasich testified that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not my responsibility or the\n[Food and Drug Administration\u2019s] responsibility to prove that the\ndrug doesn\u2019t work or is not safe.\u201d Tr. of Preliminary Injunction\nHearing 357 (Tr.). Instead, he stated, \u201cit\u2019s the responsibility of\nthe proponent to show that the drug is safe and effective.\u201dIbid.Dr. Sasich confused the standard imposed on a drug\nmanufacturer seeking approval of a therapeutic drug with the\nstandard that must be borne by a party challenging a State\u2019s lethal\ninjection protocol. When a method of execution is authorized under\nstate law, a party contending that this method violates the Eighth\nAmendment bears the burden of showing that the method creates an\nunacceptable risk of pain. Here, petitioners\u2019 own experts\neffectively conceded that they lacked evidence to prove their case\nbeyond dispute.Petitioners attempt to avoid this deficiency by\ncriticizing respondents\u2019 expert. They argue that the District Court\nshould not have credited Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony because he admitted\nthat his findings were based on \u201c\u00a0\u2018extrapolat[ions]\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nfrom studies done about much lower therapeutic doses of midazolam.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 34 (citing Tr. 667\u2013668; emphasis\ndeleted). But because a 500-milligram dose is never administered\nfor a therapeutic purpose, extrapolation was reasonable. And the\nconclusions of petitioners\u2019 experts were also based on\nextrapolations and assumptions. For example, Dr. Lubarsky relied on\n\u201cextrapolation of the ceiling effect data.\u201d App. 177.Based on the evidence that the parties presented\nto the District Court, we must affirm. Testimony from both sides\nsupports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that midazolam can render\na person insensate to pain. Dr. Evans testified that although\nmidazolam is not an analgesic, it can nonetheless \u201crender the\nperson unconscious and \u2018insensate\u2019\u00a0during the remainder of the\nprocedure.\u201dId.,at 294. In his discussion about the ceiling\neffect, Dr. Sasich agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases,\nit is \u201cexpected to produce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of\nresponse to stimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).\u201dId.,at\n243. Petitioners argue that midazolam is not powerful enough to\nkeep a person insensate to pain after the administration of the\nsecond and third drugs, but Dr. Evans presented creditable\ntestimony to the contrary. See,e.g.,Tr. 661 (testifying\nthat a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a\ncoma).[4] Indeed, low doses of\nmidazolam are sufficient to induce unconsciousness and are even\nsome-times used as the sole relevant drug in certain\nmedical procedures. Dr. Sasich conceded, for example, that\nmidazolam might be used for medical procedures like colonoscopies\nand gastroscopies. App. 267\u2013268; see also Brief for Respondents\n6\u20138.[5]Petitioners emphasize that midazolam is not\nrecommended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during\npainful surgery, but there are two reasons why this is not\ndispositive. First, as the District Court found, the 500-milligram\ndose at issue here \u201cis many times higher than a normal therapeutic\ndose of midazolam.\u201d App. 76. The effect of a small dose of\nmidazolam has minimal probative value about the effect of a\n500-milligram dose. Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam\nis not thebestdrug for maintaining unconsciousness during\nsurgery says little about whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam\nisconstitutionally adequatefor purposes of conducting an\nexecution. We recognized this point inBaze, where we\nconcluded that although the medical standard of care might require\nthe use of a blood pressure cuff and an electrocardiogram during\nsurgeries, this does not mean those procedures are required for an\nexecution to pass Eighth Amendment scrutiny. 553 U.\u00a0S., at\n60.Oklahoma has also adopted important safeguards\nto ensure that midazolam is properly administered. TheDistrict Court emphasized three requirements in\nparticular: The execution team must secure both a primary and\nbackup IV access site, it must confirm the viability of the IV\nsites, and it must continuously monitor the offender\u2019s level of\nconsciousness. The District Court did not commit clear error in\nconcluding that these safeguards help to minimize any risk that\nmight occur in the event that midazolam does not operate as\nintended. Indeed, we concluded inBazethat many of the\nsafeguards that Oklahoma employs\u2014including the establishment of a\nprimary and backup IV and the presence of personnel to monitor an\ninmate\u2014help in significantly reducing the risk that an execution\nprotocol will violate the Eighth Amendment.Id., at 55\u201356.\nAnd many other safeguards that Oklahoma has adopted mirror those\nthat the dissent inBazecomplained were absent from\nKentucky\u2019s protocol in that case. For example, the dissent argued\nthat because a consciousness check before injection of the second\ndrug \u201ccan reduce a risk of dreadful pain,\u201d Kentucky\u2019s failure to\ninclude that step in its procedure was unconstitutional.Id., at 119 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). The dissent also\ncomplained that Kentucky did not monitor the effectiveness of the\nfirst drug or pause between injection of the first and second\ndrugs.Id.,at 120\u2013121. Oklahoma has accommodated each of\nthose concerns.BPetitioners assert that midazolam\u2019s \u201cceiling\neffect\u201d undermines the District Court\u2019s finding about the\neffectiveness of the huge dose administered in the Oklahoma\nprotocol. Petitioners argue that midazolam has a \u201cceiling\u201d above\nwhich any increase in dosage produces no effect. As a result, they\nmaintain, it is wrong to assume that a 500-milligram dose has a\nmuch greater effect than a therapeutic dose of about 5 milligrams.\nBut the mere fact that midazolam has such a ceiling cannot be\ndispositive. Dr. Sasich testified that \u201call drugs essentially have\na ceiling effect.\u201d Tr. 343. The relevant question here is whether\nmidazolam\u2019s ceiling effect occurs below the level of a\n500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does not have\nthe effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by the\nsecond and third drugs.Petitioners provided little probative evidence\non this point, and the speculative evidence that they did present\nto the District Court does not come close to establishing that its\nfactual findings were clearly erroneous. Dr.\u00a0Sasich stated in\nhis expert report that the literature \u201cindicates\u201d that midazolam\nhas a ceiling effect, but he conceded that he \u201cwas unable to\ndetermine the midazolam dose for a ceiling effect on\nunconsciousness because there is no literature in which such\ntesting has been done.\u201d App. 243\u2013244. Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s report was\nsimilar,id.,at 171\u2013172, and the testimony of petitioners\u2019\nexperts at the hearing was no more compelling. Dr. Sasich frankly\nadmitted that he did a \u201csearch to try and determine at what dose of\nmidazolam you would get a ceiling effect,\u201d but concluded: \u201cI could\nnot find one.\u201d Tr. 344. The closest petitioners came was Dr.\nLubarsky\u2019s suggestion that the ceiling effect occurs \u201c[p]robably\nafter about .\u00a0.\u00a0. 40 to 50 milligrams,\u201d but he added that\nhe had not actually done the relevant calculations, and he\nadmitted: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you right now\u201d at what dose the ceiling\neffect occurs. App. 225. We cannot conclude that the District Court\ncommitted clear error in declining to find, based on such\nspeculative evidence, that the ceiling effect negates midazolam\u2019s\nability to render an inmate insensate to pain caused by the second\nand third drugs in the protocol.The principal dissent discusses the ceiling\neffect at length, but it studiously avoids suggesting that\npetitioners presented probative evidence about the dose at which\nthe ceiling effect occurs or about whether the effect occurs before\na person becomes insensate to pain. The principal dissent avoids\nthese critical issues by suggesting that such evidence is\n\u201cirrelevant if there is no dose at which the drug can\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. render a person \u2018insensate to pain.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPost, at 17. But the District Court heard evidence that the\ndrug can render a person insensate to pain, and not just from Dr.\nEvans: Dr. Sasich (one of petitioners\u2019 own experts) testified that\nhigher doses of midazolam are \u201cexpected to produce .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nlack of response to stimuli such as pain.\u201d App. 243.[6]In their brief, petitioners attempt to deflect\nattention from their failure of proof regarding midazolam\u2019s ceiling\neffect by criticizing Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony. But it waspetitioners\u2019burden to establish that midazolam\u2019s ceiling\noccurred at a dosage below the massive 500-milligram dose employed\nin the Oklahoma protocol and at a point at which the drug failed to\nrender the recipient insensate to pain. They did not meet that\nburden, and their criticisms do not undermine Dr. Evans\u2019 central\npoint, which the District Court credited, that a properly\nadministered 500-milligram dose of midazolam will render the\nrecipient unable to feel pain.One of petitioners\u2019 criticisms of Dr. Evans\u2019\ntestimony is little more than a quibble about the wording chosen by\nDr. Evans at one point in his oral testimony. Petitioners\u2019 expert,\nDr. Lubarsky, stated in his report that midazolam \u201cincreases\neffective binding of [gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)] to its\nreceptor to induce unconsciousness.\u201d[7] App. 172. Dr. Evans\u2019 report provided a similar\nexplanation of the way in which midazolam works, seeid.,at\n293\u2013294, and Dr. Lubarsky did not dispute the accuracy of that\nexplanation when he testified at the hearing. Petitioners contend,\nhowever, that Dr. Evans erred when he said at the hearing that\n\u201c[m]idazolam attaches to GABA receptors,inhibiting GABA.\u201dId.,at 312 (emphasis added). Petitioners contend that this\nstatement was incorrect because \u201cfar frominhibitingGABA,\nmidazolamfacilitates its bindingto GABA receptors.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 38.In making this argument, petitioners are simply\nquarrelling with the words that Dr. Evans used during oral\ntestimony in an effort to explain how midazolam works in terms\nunderstandable to a layman. Petitioners do not suggest that the\ndiscussion of midazolam in Dr. Evans\u2019 expert report was inaccurate,\nand as for Dr. Evans\u2019 passing use of the term \u201cinhibiting,\u201d Dr.\nLubarksy\u2019s own expert report states that GABA\u2019s \u201cinhibitionof brain activity is accentuated by midazolam.\u201d App. 232 (emphasis\nadded). Dr. Evans\u2019 oral use of the word \u201cinhibiting\u201d\u2014particularly\nin light of his written testimony\u2014does not invalidate the District\nCourt\u2019s decision to rely on his testimony.Petitioners also point to an apparent conflict\nbetween Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony and a declaration by Dr. Lubarsky\n(submitted after the District Court ruled) regarding the biological\nprocess that produces midazolam\u2019s ceiling effect. But even if Dr.\nLubarsky\u2019s declaration is correct, it is largely beside the point.\nWhat matters for present purposes is the dosage at which the\nceiling effect kicks in, not the biological process that produces\nthe effect. And Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s declaration does not render the\nDistrict Court\u2019s findings clearly erroneous with respect to that\ncritical issue.CPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments about\nmidazolam all lack merit. First, we are not persuaded by\npetitioners\u2019 argument that Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony should have been\nrejected because of some of the sources listed in his report.\nPetitioners criticize two of the \u201cselected references\u201d that Dr.\nEvans cited in his expert report: the Web site drugs.com and a\nmaterial safety data sheet (MSDS) about midazolam. Petitioners\u2019\nargument is more of aDaubertchallenge to Dr. Evans\u2019\ntestimony than an argument that the District Court\u2019s findings were\nclearly erroneous. The District Court concluded that Dr. Evans was\n\u201cwell-qualified to give the expert testimony that he gave\u201d and that\n\u201chis testimony was the product of reliable principles and methods\nreliably applied to the facts of this case.\u201d App. 75\u201376. To the\nextent that the reliability of Dr.Evans\u2019 testimony is even before\nus, the District Court\u2019s con-clusion that his testimony was based\non reliable sources is reviewed under the deferential\n\u201cabuse-of-discretion\u201d standard.General Elec. Co.v.Joiner, 522 U.\u00a0S. 136 \u2013143 (1997). Dr. Evans relied on\nmultiple sources and his own expertise, and his testimony may not\nbe disqualified simply because one source (drugs.com) warns that it\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018is not intended for medical advice\u2019\u00a0\u201d and another (the\nMSDS) states that its information is provided \u201c\u00a0\u2018without any\nwarranty, express or implied, regarding its correctness.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 36. Medical journals that both parties rely\nupon typically contain similar disclaimers. See,e.g.,\nAnesthesiology, Terms and Conditions of Use, online at\nhttp://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/ss/terms.aspx (\u201cNone of the\ninformation on this Site shall be used to diagnose or treat any\nhealth problem or disease\u201d). Dr. Lubarsky\u2014petitioners\u2019 own\nexpert\u2014relied on an MSDS to argue that midazolam has a ceiling\neffect. And petitioners do not identify any incorrect statements\nfrom drugs.com on which Dr. Evans relied. In fact, although Dr.\nSasich submitted a declaration to the Court of Appeals criticizing\nDr. Evans\u2019 reference to drugs.com, that declaration does not\nidentify a single fact from that site\u2019s discussion of midazolam\nthat was materially inaccurate.Second, petitioners argue that Dr. Evans\u2019 expert\nreport contained a mathematical error, but we find this argument\ninsignificant. Dr. Evans stated in his expert report that the\nlowest dose of midazolam resulting in human deaths, according to an\nMSDS, is 0.071 mg/kg delivered intravenously. App. 294. Dr.\nLubarsky agreed with this statement. Specifically, he testified\nthat fatalities have occurred in doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.07\nmg/kg, and he stated that Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony to that effect was\n\u201ca true statement\u201d (though he added those fatalities occurred among\nthe elderly).Id.,at 217. We do not understand petitioners\nto dispute the testimony of Dr. Evans and their own expert that\n0.071 mg/kg is a potentially fatal dose of midazolam. Instead, they\nmake much of the fact that the MSDS attached to Dr. Evans\u2019 report\napparently contained a typographical error and reported the lowest\ntoxic dose as 71 mg/kg. That Dr. Evans did not repeat that\nincorrect figure but instead reported the correct dose supports\nrather than undermines his testimony. In any event, the alleged\nerror in the MSDS is irrelevant because the District Court\nexpressly stated that it did not rely on the figure in the MSDS.\nSeeid.,at 75.Third, petitioners argue that there is no\nconsensus among the States regarding midazolam\u2019s efficacy because\nonly four States (Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio) have used\nmidazolam as part of an execution. Petitioners rely on the\nplurality\u2019s statement inBazethat \u201cit is difficult to\nregard a practice as \u2018objectively intolerable\u2019 when it is in fact\nwidely tolerated,\u201d and the plurality\u2019s emphasis on the fact that 36\nStates had adopted lethal injection and 30 States used the\nparticular three-drug protocol at issue in that case. 553\nU.\u00a0S., at 53. But while the near-universal use of the\nparticular protocol at issue inBazesupported our\nconclusion that this protocol did not violate the Eighth Amendment,\nwe did not say that the converse was true,i.e.,that other\nprotocols or methods of execution are of doubtful\nconstitutionality. That argument, if accepted, would hamper the\nadoption of new and potentially more humane methods of execution\nand would prevent States from adapting to changes in the\navailability of suitable drugs.Fourth, petitioners argue that difficulties with\nOklahoma\u2019s execution of Lockett and Arizona\u2019s July 2014 execution\nof Joseph Wood establish that midazolam is sure or very likely to\ncause serious pain. We are not persuaded. Aside from the Lockett\nexecution, 12 other executions have been conducted using the\nthree-drug protocol at issue here, and those appear to have been\nconducted without any significant problems. See Brief for\nRespondents 32; Brief for State of Florida asAmicus Curiae1. Moreover, Lockett was administered only 100 milligrams of\nmidazolam, and Oklahoma\u2019s investigation into that execution\nconcluded that the difficulties were due primarily to the execution\nteam\u2019s inability to obtain an IV access site. And the Wood\nexecution did not involve the protocol at issue here. Wood did not\nreceive a single dose of 500 milligrams of midazolam; instead, he\nreceived fifteen 50-milligram doses over the span of two\nhours.[8] Brief for Respondents\n12, n.\u00a09. And Arizona used a different two-drug protocol that\npaired midazolam with hydromorphone, a drug that is not at issue in\nthis case.Ibid.When all of the circumstances are\nconsidered, the Lockett and Wood executions have little probative\nvalue for present purposes.Finally, we find it appropriate to respond to\nthe principal dissent\u2019s groundless suggestion that our decision is\ntantamount to allowing prisoners to be \u201cdrawn and quartered, slowly\ntortured to death, or actually burned at the stake.\u201dPost,\nat 28. That is simply not true, and the principal dissent\u2019s resort\nto this outlandish rhetoric reveals the weakness of its legal\narguments.VIFor these reasons, the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1The three other drug\ncombinations that Oklahoma may admin-ister are: (1)\u00a0a single\ndose of pentobarbital, (2)\u00a0a single dose ofsodium thiopental,\nand (3)\u00a0a dose of midazolam followed by a dose of\nhydromorphone.2Justice Sotomayor\u2019s\ndissent (hereinafter principal dissent),post, at 24\u201325,\ninexplicably refuses to recognize that The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion\ninBazesets out the holding of the case. InBaze,\nthe opinion of The Chief Justice was joined by two other Justices.\nJustices Scalia and Thomas took the broader position that a method\nof execution is consistent with the Eighth Amendment unless it is\ndeliberately designed to inflict pain. 553 U.\u00a0S., at 94\n(Thomas, J. concurring in judgment). Thus, as explained inMarksv.United States, 430 U.\u00a0S. 188, 193\n(1977) , The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion sets out the holding of the\ncase. It is for this reason that petitioners base their argument on\nthe rule set out in that opinion. See Brief for Petitioners 25,\n28.3Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich,\npetitioners\u2019 key witnesses, both testified that midazolam is\ninappropriate for a third reason, namely, that it creates a risk of\n\u201cparadoxical reactions\u201d such as agitation, hyperactiv-ity, and\ncombativeness. App. 175 (expert report of Dr. Lubarsky);id., at 242, 244 (expert report of Dr. Sasich). The District\nCourt found, however, that the frequency with which a paradoxical\nreaction occurs \u201cis speculative\u201d and that the risk \u201coccurs with the\nhighest frequency in low therapeutic doses.\u201dId., at 78.\nIndeed, Dr. Sasich conceded that the incidence or risk of\nparadoxical reactions with midazolam \u201cis unknown\u201d and that reports\nestimate the risk to vary only \u201cfrom 1% to above 10%.\u201dId.,\nat 244. Moreover, the mere fact that a method of execution might\nresult in some unintended side effects does not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation. \u201c[T]he Constitution does not demand the\navoidance of all risk of pain.\u201dBaze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47\n(plurality opinion).4The principal dissent\nmisunderstands the record when it bizarrely suggests that midazolam\nis about as dangerous as a peanut.Post, at 15. Dr. Evans\nand Dr. Lubarsky agreed that midazolam has caused fatalities in\ndoses as low as 0.04 to 0.07 milligrams per kilogram. App. 217,\n294. Even if death from such low doses is a \u201crare, unfortunate side\neffec[t],\u201dpost, at 15, the District Court found that a\nmassive 500-milligram dose\u2014many times higher than the lowest dose\nreported to have produced death\u2014will likely cause death in under an\nhour. App. 76\u201377.5Petitioners\u2019 experts also\ndeclined to testify that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is\nalways insufficient to place a person in a coma and render him\ninsensate to pain. Dr. Lubarsky argued only that the 500-milligram\ndose cannot \u201creliably\u201d produce a coma.Id., 228. And when\nDr. Sasich was asked whether he could say to a reasonable degree of\ncertainty that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would not render\nsomeone unconscious, he replied that he could not.Id.,at\n271\u2013272. A product label for midazolam that Dr. Sasich attached to\nhis expert report also acknowledged that an overdose of midazolam\ncan cause a coma. See Expert Report of Larry D. Sasich, in No.\n14\u20136244 (CA10), p. 34.6The principal dissent\nemphasizes Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s supposedly contrary testimony, but the\nDistrict Court was entitled to credit Dr. Evans (and Dr. Sasich)\ninstead of Dr. Lubarsky on this point. And the District Court had\nstrong reasons not to credit Dr. Lubarsky, who even argued that a\nprotocol that includessodium thiopentalis \u201cconstructed to\nproduce egregious harm and suffering.\u201d App. 227.7GABA is \u201can amino acid\nthat functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and\nspinal cord.\u201d Mosby\u2019s Medical Dictionary8The principal dissent\nemphasizes Dr. Lubarsky\u2019s testimony that it is irrelevant that Wood\nwas administered the drug over a 2-hour period.Post, at 20.\nBut Dr. Evans disagreed and testified that if a 750-milligram dose\n\u201cwas spread out over a long period of time,\u201d such as one hour\n(i.e.,half the time at issue in the Wood execution), the\ndrug might not be as effective as if it were administered all at\nonce. Tr. 667. The principal dissent states that this\n\u201cpronouncement was entirely unsupported,\u201dpost,at 20,\nn.\u00a06, but it was supported by Dr. Evans\u2019 expertise and decades\nof experience. And it would be unusual for an expert testifying on\nthe stand to punctuate each sentence with citation to\na",
