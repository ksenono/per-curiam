S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-666DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF KENTUCKY, et\u00a0al.,\nPETITIONERSv.GEORGE W. DAVIS et ux.on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of\nkentucky[May 19, 2008]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.I agree with the Court that\nKentucky\u2019s differential tax scheme is constitutional. But rather\nthan apply a body of doctrine that \u201chas no basis in the\nConstitution and has proved unworkable in practice,\u201d I would\nentirely \u201cdiscard the Court\u2019s negative Commerce Clause\njurisprudence.\u201dUnited Haulers Assn., Inc.v.Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 1) (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment). See alsoAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc.v.Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n,545 U. S. 429, 439\n(2005) (same) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis\nin the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved\nvirtually unworkable in application\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingCamps\nNewfound/Owatonna, Inc.v.Town of Harrison,520 U. S. 564, 610\n(1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting))). Because Congress\u2019 authority to\nregulate commerce \u201camong the several States,\u201d U. S. Const.,\nArt.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a03, necessarily includes the power \u201cto\nprevent state regulation of interstate commerce,\u201dUnited\nHaulers,supra,at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), the text of the Constitution makes clear\nthat the Legislature\u2014not the Judiciary\u2014bears the responsibility of\ncurbing what it perceives as state regulatory burdens on interstate\ncommerce.As the Court acknowledges, Kentucky\u2019s\ndifferential tax scheme is far from unique.Ante, at 1.\nFor nearly a century, some States have treated income derived from\nout-of-state bonds differently than that derived from their\nin-state counterparts.Ibid. At present, the vast majority\nof the States do so.Ante, at 5.The practice is\nthus both longstanding and widespread, yet Congress has refrained\nfrom preempting it. Cf.New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co.v.Division of Tax Appeals of N.\u00a0J.,338 U. S. 665, 671\n(1950) (holding that a federal statute exempting interest-bearing\nobligations of the United States from state and local taxation\npre-empted a conflicting state statute). In the \u201cface of [this]\ncongressional silence,\u201dUnited Haulers,supra,at\n___ (slip op., at 5) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), we have\nno authority to invalidate Kentucky\u2019s differential tax scheme. I\nwould reverse the judgment below on that basis.",
