HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER10\u20131542v.CARLOS MARTINEZ GUTIERREZERIC H. HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER10\u20131543v.DAMIEN ANTONIO SAWYERSon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[May 21, 2012]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.An immigration statute, 8 U.\u00a0S. C.\n\u00a71229b(a), authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the removal of\nan alien from the United States so long as the alien satisfies\ncertain criteria. One of those criteria relates to the length of\ntime an alien has lawfully resided in the United States, and\nanother to the length of time he has held permanent resident status\nhere. We consider whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or\nBoard) could reasonably conclude that an alien living in this\ncountry as a child must meet those requirements on his own, without\ncounting a parent\u2019s years of residence or immigration status. We\nhold that the BIA\u2019s approach is based on a permissible construction\nof the statute.IAThe immigration laws have long given the\nAttorney General discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable\naliens to remain in the United States. SeeJudulangv.Holder, 565 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2\u20134).\nThe Attorney General formerly exercised this authority by virtue of\n\u00a7212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66Stat. 187,\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(c) (1994 ed.), a provision with some\nlingering relevance here, seeinfra, at 7\u20139. But in 1996,\nCongress replaced \u00a7212(c) with \u00a71229b(a) (2006 ed.). That new\nsection, applicable to the cases before us, provides as\nfollows:\u201c(a) Cancellation of removal for\ncertain permanent residents\u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal in the\ncase of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United\nStates if the alien\u2014\u201c(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for\npermanent residence for not less than 5 years,\u201c(2) has resided in the United States\ncontinuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status,\nand\u201c(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated\nfelony.\u201dIbid.Section 1229b(a) thus specifies the criteria\nthat make an alien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney\nGeneral. The first paragraph requires that the alien have held the\nstatus of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least five\nyears. And the second adds that the alien must have lived in the\nUnited States for at least seven continuous years after a lawful\nadmission, whether as an LPR or in some other immigration\nstatus.[1] (The third paragraph\nis not at issue in these cases.)The question we consider here is whether, in\napplying this statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent\u2019s\nyears of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her child.\nThat question arises because a child may enter the country\nlawfully, or may gain LPR status,afterone of his parents\ndoes. A parent may therefore satisfy the re- quirements of\n\u00a7\u00a71229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her child, considered\nindependently, does not. In these circum- stances, is the child\neligible for cancellation of removal?The Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to\nconfront this issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief.\nSeeCuevas-Gasparv.Gonzales,430 F.3d 1013(2005). Enrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents\ncame to the United States illegally in 1985, when he was one year\nold. Cuevas-Gaspar\u2019s mother was lawfully admitted to the country in\n1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully admitted only in\n1997, when he too received LPR status. That meant that when\nCuevas-Gaspar committed a removable offense in 2002, he could not\nindependently sat- isfy \u00a71229b(a)(2)\u2019s requirement of seven\nconsecutive years of residence after a lawful entry.[2] (The parties agreed that he just met\n\u00a71229b(a)(1)\u2019s 5-year status requirement.) The Board deemed\nCuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that account, but the Ninth\nCircuit found that position unreasonable. According to the Court of\nAppeals, the Board should have \u201cimputed\u201d to Cuevas-Gaspar his\nmother\u2019s years of continuous residence during the time he lived\nwith her as an \u201cunemancipated minor.\u201dId.,at 1029. That\napproach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both the INA\u2019s\n\u201cpriorit[ization]\u201d of familial relations and the Board\u2019s\n\u201cconsistent willingness\u201d to make imputations from a parent to a\nchild in many areas of immigration law.Id.,at 1026.The Board responded by reiterating its\nopposition to imputation under both relevant paragraphs of\n\u00a71229b(a). InIn\u00a0re Escobar, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N.\nDec. 231 (2007), the Board considered whether a child could rely on\na parent\u2019s period of LPR status to satisfy \u00a71229b(a)(1)\u2019s 5-year\nclock. The Board expressly \u201cdisagree[d] with the reasoning\u201d ofCuevas-Gaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s understanding\nof both the statute and the Board\u2019s prior policies. 24\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 233\u2013234, and n.\u00a04. Accordingly,\nthe Board announced that it would \u201cdecline to extend\u201dCuevas-Gasparto any case involving \u00a71229b(a)(1), and that\nit would ignore the decision even as to \u00a71229b(a)(2) outside the\nNinth Circuit. 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 235. A year later,\ninMatter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec.\n599 (2008), the BIA took the final step: It rejected imputation\nunder \u00a71229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit,\nmaintaining that the court should abandonCuevas-Gasparand\ndefer to the Board\u2019s intervening reasoned decision inEscobar. SeeRamirez-Vargas, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N.\nDec., at 600\u2013601 (citingNational Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn.v.Brand X Internet Services,545 U.S.\n967(2005)).The BIA\u2019s position on imputation touched off a\nsplit in the courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both\ndeferred to the BIA\u2019s approach as a reasonable construction of\n\u00a71229b(a). SeeAugustinv.Attorney Gen., 520 F.3d\n264 (CA3 2008);Deusv.Holder, 591 F.3d 807 (CA5\n2009). But inMercado-Zazuetav.Holder, 580 F.3d\n1102 (2009), the Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view,\ndeclaring the BIA\u2019s position unreasonable and requiring imputation\nunder both \u00a7\u00a71229b(a)(1) and (a)(2).Seeid.,at 1103\n(\u201c[T]he rationale and holding ofCuevas-Gasparapply equally\nto the five-year permanent residence and the seven-year continuance\nresidence requirements\u201d of \u00a71229b(a)).BTwo cases are before us. In 1989, at the age\nof five, respondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the\nUnited States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez\u2019s father was\nlawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR. But\nMartinez Gutierrez himself was neither lawfully admitted nor given\nLPR status until 2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was\napprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. He\nadmitted the offense, and sought cancellation of removal. The\nImmigration Judge concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for\nrelief because of his father\u2019s immigration history, even though\nMartinez Gutierrez could not satisfy either \u00a71229b(a)(1) or\n\u00a71229b(a)(2) on his own. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\u20131542,\npp. 20a\u201322a (citingCuevas-Gaspar, 430 F.\u00a03d 1013). The\nBIA reversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand,\nreaffirmed its disposition in an order relying onEscobar,\nsee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\u20131542, at 5a\u20136a. The Ninth\nCircuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez\u2019s petition for review and\nremanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of the\ncourt\u2019s contrary decisions. See 411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011).Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted\nas an LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time,\nhis mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive\nyears following a lawful entry. After Sawyers\u2019s conviction of a\ndrug offense in August 2002, the Government initiated removal\nproceedings. The Immigration Judge found Sawyers ineligible for\ncancellation of removal because he was a few months shy of the\nseven years of continuous residence required under \u00a71229b(a)(2).\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\u20131543, p. 13a. (No one doubted\nthat Sawyers had by that time held LPR status for five years, as\nrequired under \u00a71229b(a)(1).) The Board affirmed, relying on its\nreasoning inEscobar. SeeIn re Sawyers, No. A44 852\n478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec. 26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth\nCircuit for review, arguing that the Board should have counted his\nmother\u2019s years of residency while he was a minor toward\n\u00a71229b(a)(2)\u2019s 7-year requirement. As inGutierrez, the\nCourt of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the\nBIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010).We granted the Government\u2019s petitions for\ncertiorari, 564 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2011), consolidated the cases, and\nnow reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgments.IIThe Board has required each alien seeking\ncancellation of removal to satisfy \u00a71229b(a)\u2019s requirements on his\nown, without counting a parent\u2019s years of continuous residence or\nLPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable\nconstruction of the statute, whether or not it is the only possible\ninterpretation or even the one a court might think best. SeeChevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc.v.Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc.,467 U.S.\n837, 843\u2013844, and n.\u00a011 (1984); see alsoINSv.Aguirre-Aguirre,526 U.S.\n415, 424\u2013425 (1999) (accordingChevrondeference to the\nBoard\u2019s interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA\u2019s view on\nimputation meets that standard, and so need not decide if the\nstatute permits any other construction.The Board\u2019s approach is consistent with the\nstatute\u2019s text, as even respondents tacitly concede. Section\n1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require it. The\nprovision calls for \u201cthe alien\u201d\u2014not, say, \u201cthe alien or one of his\nparents\u201d\u2014to meet the three prerequisites for cancellation of\nremoval. Similarly, several of \u00a71229b(a)\u2019s other terms have\nstatutory definitions referring to only a single individual. See,e.g.,\u00a71101(a)(13)(A) (\u201cThe terms \u2018admission\u2019 and \u2018admitted\u2019\nmean, with respect toan alien, the lawful entry ofthe\nalieninto the United States\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a71101(a)(33)\n(\u201cThe term \u2018residence\u2019 means the place of general abode; the place\nof general abode of a person meanshisprincipal, actual\ndwelling\u201d (emphasis added)). Respondents contend that none of this\nlanguage \u201cforecloses\u201d imputation: They argue that if the Board\nallowed imputation, \u201c[t]he alien\u201d seeking cancellation would \u201cstill\nhave to satisfy the provision\u2019s durational requirements\u201d\u2014just\npursuant to a different computational rule. Brief for Respondent\nMartinez Gutierrez in No. 10\u20131542, p.\u00a016 (hereinafter Martinez\nGutierrez Brief); see Brief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10\u20131543,\npp. 11, 15 (hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the\nBoard\u2019s history of permitting imputation under similarly \u201csilent\u201d\nstatutes supports this construction. Martinez Gutierrez Brief 16;\nsee Sawyers Brief 15\u201316;infra, at 10\u201311. But even if\nso\u2014even if the Boardcouldadopt an imputation rule\nconsistent with the statute\u2019s text\u2014that would not avail\nrespondents. Taken alone, the language of \u00a71229b(a) at least\npermits the Board to go the other way\u2014to say that \u201cthe alien\u201d must\nmeet the statutory conditions independently, without relying on a\nparent\u2019s history.For this reason, respondents focus on\n\u00a71229b(a)\u2019s history and context\u2014particularly, the provision\u2019s\nrelationship to the INA\u2019s former \u00a7212(c) and its associated\nimputation rule. Section 212(c)\u2014\u00a71229b(a)\u2019s predecessor\u2014generally\nallowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an alien\nwith LPR status who had maintained a \u201clawful unrelinquished\ndomicile of seven consecutive years\u201d in this country. 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(c) (1994 ed.). Like \u00a71229b(a), \u00a7212(c) was\nsilent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits\n(the only appellate courts to consider the question) concluded\nthat, in determining eligibility for relief under \u00a7212(c), the\nBoard should impute a parent\u2019s years of domicile to his or her\nchild. SeeRosariov.INS, 962 F.2d 220 (CA2 1992);Lepe-Guitronv.INS,16 F.3d 1021, 1024\u20131026 (CA9 1994);Morelv.INS,90 F.3d 833, 840\u2013842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at\ncommon law, a minor\u2019s domicile was \u201cthe same as that of its\nparents, since most children are presumed not legally capable of\nforming the requisite intent to establish their own domicile.\u201dRosario,962 F.\u00a02d, at 224; seeMississippi Band of\nChoctaw Indiansv.Holyfield,490 U.S.\n30, 48 (1989) (defining \u201cdomicile\u201d as \u201cphysical presence in a\nplace in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one\u2019s\nintent to remain there\u201d). So by the time Congress replaced \u00a7212(c)\nwith \u00a71229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent\u2019s years of domicile\nto a child in determining eligibility for cancellation of removal.\nSawyers argues that against this backdrop, Congress \u201cwould have\nunderstood the language it chose [in \u00a71229b(a)] to provide for\nimputation.\u201d Sawyers Brief 10.But we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an\nimputation requirement when it passed \u00a71229b(a). As all parties\nagree, Congress enacted \u00a7\u00a71229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve an\nunrelated question about \u00a7212(c)\u2019s meaning. Seeid., at 17;\nMartinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner 25. Courts had\ndiffered on whether an alien\u2019s \u201cseven consecutive years\u201d of\ndomicile under \u00a7212(c) all had to post-date the alien\u2019s obtaining\nLPR status. SeeCuevas-Gaspar, 430 F.\u00a03d, at 1027\u20131028\n(canvassing split). Congress addressed that split by creating two\ndistinct durational conditions: the 5-year status requirement of\nsubsection (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an\nLPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of subsection\n(a)(2), which can include years preceding the acquisition of LPR\nstatus. In doing so, Congress elimi- nated the very\nterm\u2014\u201cdomicile\u201d\u2014on which the appeals courts had founded their\nimputation decisions. Seesupra,at 8. That alteration dooms\nrespondents\u2019 position, because the doctrine of congressional\nratification applies only when Congress reenacts a statute without\nrelevant change. SeeJamav.Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement,543 U.S.\n335, 349 (2005).[3] So the\nstatutory history here provides no basis for holding that the BIA\nflouted a congressional command in adopting its no-imputation\npolicy.Nor do the INA\u2019s purposes demand imputation\nhere, as both respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez,\nthe BIA\u2019s approach contradicts that statute\u2019s objectives of\n\u201cproviding relief to aliens with strong ties to the United States\u201d\nand \u201cpromoting family unity.\u201d Martinez Gutierrez Brief 40, 44; see\nSawyers Brief 37. We agree\u2014indeed, we have stated\u2014that the goals\nrespondents identify underlie or inform many provisions of\nimmigration law. SeeFiallov.Bell,430 U.S.\n787, 795, n.\u00a06 (1977);INSv.Errico,385 U.S.\n214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA\u2019s only goals, and\nCongress did not pursue them to thenth degree. To take one\nexample, \u00a71229b(a)\u2019s third paragraph makes aliens convicted of\naggravated felonies ineligible for cancellation of removal,\nregardless of the strength of their family ties. See \u00a71229b(a)(3).\nAnd more generally\u2014as these very cases show\u2014not every alien who\nobtains LPR status can immediately get the same for her spouse or\nminor children. See Brief for Petitioner 31\u201332, and n.\u00a09\n(providing program-specific examples). We cannot read a silent\nstatute as requiring (not merely allowing) imputation just because\nthat rule would be family-friendly.Respondents\u2019 stronger arguments take a different\ntack\u2014that we should refuse to defer to the Board\u2019s decision even\nassuming Congress placed the question of imputation in its hands.\nRespondents offer two main reasons. First, they contend that the\nBoard\u2019s approach to \u00a71229b(a) cannot be squared with its acceptance\nof imputation under other, similar statutory provisions. This\n\u201cwil[d]\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018[u]n- explained inconsistency,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Sawyers\nasserts, is the very \u201cparadigm of arbitrary agency action.\u201d Sawyers\nBrief 13, 41 (emphasis deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief\n52\u201354. Second, they argue that the Board did not appreciate its own\ndiscretion over whether to allow imputation. The Board, they say,\nthought Congress had forbidden imputation, and so did not bring its\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018experience and expertise to bear\u2019\u00a0\u201d on the issue.Id.,at 31 (quotingPDK Labs. Inc.v.DEA,362 F.3d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see Sawyers Brief 38\u201339. These\narguments are not insubstantial, but in the end neither persuades\nus to deny the Board the usual deference we accord to agency\ninterpretations.Start with the claim of inconsistency. The BIA\nhas indeed imputed parental attributes to children under other INA\nprovisions that do not mention the matter. Section 1182(k), for\nexample, enables the Attorney General to let certain inadmissible\naliens into the country if he finds \u201cthat inadmissibility was not\nknown to, and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of\nreasonable diligence by, the immigrant before the time of\ndeparture.\u201d Like \u00a71229b(a), that provision refers to a single\nperson (\u201cthe immigrant\u201d) and says nothing about imputation. But the\nBIA has consistently imputed a parent\u2019s knowledge of\ninadmissibility (or lack thereof) to a child. See,e.g.,Senicav.INS,16 F.3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (\u201cTherefore, the BIA reasoned,\nthe children were not entitled to relief under [\u00a71182(k)] because\n[their mother\u2019s] knowledge was imputed to them\u201d);In\u00a0re\nMushtaq, No. A43 968 082, 2007 WL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007)\n(per\u00a0curiam);In\u00a0re Ahmed, No. A41 982 631,\n2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17, 2006) (per\u00a0curiam).Similarly, the Board imputes a parent\u2019s\nabandonment (or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when\ndetermining whether that child can reenter the country as a\n\u201creturning resident immigran[t]\u201d under \u00a71181(b). SeeMatter of\nZamora, 17 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (hold-\ning that a \u201cvoluntary and intended abandonment by the mother is\nimputed\u201d to an unemancipated minor child for purposes of applying\n\u00a71181(b));Matter of Huang, 19 I. &\u00a0N. Dec. 749,\n755\u2013756 (1988) (concluding that a mother and her children abandoned\ntheir LPR status based solely on the mother\u2019s intent);In\u00a0re Ali, No. A44 143 723, 2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept.\n11, 2006) (holding that a child could not have abandoned his LPR\nstatus if his mother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that\nis so even though neither \u00a71181(b) nor any other statutory\nprovision says that the BIA should look to the parent in assessing\nthe child\u2019s eligibility for reentry.ButEscobarprovided a reasoned\nexplanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters\ninvolving an alien\u2019s state of mind, while declining to impute\nobjective conditions or characteristics. See 24\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 233\u2013234, and n.\u00a04. On one side\nof the line, knowledge of inadmissibility is all and only about a\nmental state. See,e.g., Senica, 16 F.\u00a03d, at 1015;In\u00a0re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156. Likewise, abandonment of\nstatus turns on an alien\u2019s \u201cintention of . . . returning to the\nUnited States\u201d to live as a permanent resident,Zamora, 17\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 396; the Board thus explained that\nimputing abandonment is \u201cconsistent with the . . . longstanding\npolicy that a child cannot form the intent necessary to establish\nhis or her own domicile,\u201dEscobar, 24 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N.\nDec., at 234, n.\u00a04. And as that analogy recalls, the 7-year\ndomicile requirement of the former \u00a7212(c) also involved intent and\nso lent itself to imputation. SeeRosario,962 F.\u00a02d,\nat 224;supra,at 8. But the 5- and 7-year clocks of\n\u00a71229b(a) fall on the other side of the line, because they hinge\nnot on any state of mind but on the objective facts of immigration\nstatus and place of residence. SeeEscobar, 24\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 233 (\u201c[W]e find that residence is\ndifferent from domicile because it \u2018contains no element of\nsubjective intent\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingCuevas-Gaspar, 430\nF.\u00a03d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J., dissenting))). The BIA\u2019s varied\nrulings on imputation thus largely follow from one straightforward\ndistinction.[4]Similarly,Escobarbelies respondents\u2019\nclaim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it\nthought Congress had left it no other choice. The Board, to be\nsure, did not highlight the statute\u2019s gaps or ambiguity; rather, it\nread \u00a71229b(a)\u2019s text to support its conclusion that each alien\nmust personally meet that section\u2019s durational requirements. See 24\nI.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec., at 235. But the Board also explained\nthat \u201cthere [was] no precedent\u201d in its decisions for imputing\nstatus or residence, and distinguished those statutory terms, on\nthe ground just explained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR\nstatus.Id.,at 234; seeid.,at 233\u2013234, and\nn.\u00a04. And the Board argued that allowing imputation under\n\u00a71229b(a) would create anomalies in administration of the statutory\nscheme by permitting even those who had not obtained LPR status\u2014or\ncould not do so because of a criminal history\u2014to become eligible\nfor cancellation of removal. Seeid.,at 234\u2013235, and\nn.\u00a05. The Board therefore saw neither a \u201clogical\u201d nor a\n\u201clegal\u201d basis for adopting a policy of imputation.Id.,at\n233. We see nothing in this decision to suggest that the Board\nthought its hands tied, or that it might have reached a different\nresult if assured it could do so. To the contrary, the decision\nexpressed the BIA\u2019s view, based on its experience implementing the\nINA, that statutory text, administrative practice, and regulatory\npolicy all pointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.\nIn making that case, the decision reads like a multitude of agency\ninterpretations\u2014not the best example, but far from the worst\u2014to\nwhich we and other courts have routinely deferred. We see no reason\nnot to do so here.Because the Board\u2019s rejection of imputation\nunder \u00a71229b(a) is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the\nstatute,\u201dChevron, 467 U.\u00a0S., at 843, we reverse the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgments and remand the cases for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The INA defines\n\u201cadmitted\u201d as referring to \u201cthe lawful entry ofthe alien into the\nUnited States after inspection and authorization by an immigration\nofficer.\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101 (a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock\nof \u00a71229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien\u2019slawfulentry.2The 7-year clock stopped\nrunning on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar\u2019s offense under a statutory\nprovision known as the \u201cstop-time\u201d rule. See \u00a71229b(d)(1) (\u201cFor\npurposes of this section, any period of continuous residence\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. in the United States shall be deemed to end\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is served a notice to appear\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. or .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien has committed an\noffense .\u00a0.\u00a0. that renders the alien .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nremovable from the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. , whichever is\nearliest\u201d).3Sawyers contends that\n\u00a71229b(a)(2)\u2019s replacement term\u2014\u201cresided continuously\u201d\u2014is a \u201cterm\nof art\u201d in the immigration context which incorporates \u201can intent\ncomponent\u201d and so means the same thing as \u201cdomiciled.\u201d Sawyers\nBrief 25\u201326 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers argues, we should\nread \u00a71229b(a) as reenacting \u00a7212(c) without meaningful change. Seeid.,at 25. But even assuming that Congress could ratify\njudicial decisions based on the term \u201cdomicile\u201d through a new\nstatute using a synonym for that term, we do not think \u201cresided\ncontinuously\u201d qualifies. The INA defines \u201cresidence\u201d as a person\u2019s\n\u201cprinci-pal, actual dwelling place in fact,without regard to\nintent,\u201d 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(33) (emphasis added),\nand we find nothing to suggest that Congress added an intent\nelement, inconsistent with that definition, by requiring that the\nresidence have been maintained \u201ccontinuously for 7\nyears.\u201d4Respondents aver that the\nBIA deviates from this principle in imputing to a child his\nparent\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018firm resettlement\u2019\u00a0\u201d in another country,\nwhich renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to\nintent. See Sawyers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the\nGovernment denies that it has a \u201csettled imputation rule\u201d in that\ncontext. Reply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which\nrespondents rely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a\nregional commissioner (not the Board itself) that considered the\nconduct of both the parents and the child, seeMatter of Ng,\n12 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth Circuit\ndecision imputing a parent\u2019s resettlement even though the Board had\nfocused only on the child\u2019s actions, seeVangv.INS,146 F.3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we\ncannot conclude that the Board has any policy on imputing\nresettlement, let alone one inconsistent withEscobar.",
