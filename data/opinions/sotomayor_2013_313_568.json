It turns out that the unproven \u201celement\u201d was not actually\na required element at all. We must de- cide whether an erroneous\nacquittal such as this nevertheless constitutes an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes, which would mean that Evans could not be\nretried. This Court has previously held that a judicial acquittal\npremised upon a \u201cmisconstruction\u201d of a criminal statute is an\n\u201cacquittal on the merits .\u00a0.\u00a0. [that] bars retrial.\u201dArizonav.Rumsey,467 U.S.\n203, 211 (1984). Seeing no meaningful constitutional\ndistinction between a trial court\u2019s \u201cmisconstruction\u201d of a statute\nand its erroneous addition of a statutory element, we hold that a\nmidtrial acquittal in these circumstances is an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes as well.IThe State charged Evans with burning \u201cother\nreal property,\u201d a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73 (1981). The\nState\u2019s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had burned down an\nunoccupied house. At the close of the State\u2019s case, however, Evans\nmoved for a directed ver- dict of acquittal. He pointed the court\nto the applicable Michigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed\nas the \u201cFourth\u201d element of the offense \u201cthat the building was not a\ndwelling house.\u201d 3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a731.3, p. 31\u20137 (2d ed.,\nSupp. 2006/2007). And the commentary to the Instructions\nemphasized, \u201can essential element is that the structure burned isnota dwelling house.\u201dId.,at 31\u20138. Evans argued\nthat Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.72 criminal- izes common-law arson,\nwhich requires that the structure burned be a dwelling, while the\nprovision under which he was charged, \u00a7750.73, covers all other\nreal property.[1] Persuaded,\nthe trial court granted the motion. 491 Mich. 1, 8, 810 N.W.2d 535,\n539 (2012). The court explained that the \u201c\u00a0\u2018testimony [of the\nhomeowner] was this was a dwelling house,\u2019\u00a0\u201d so the\nnondwelling requirement of \u00a7750.73 was not met.Ibid.On the State\u2019s appeal, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals reversed and remanded. 288 Mich. App. 410, 794 N.W.2d 848\n(2010). Evans had conceded, and the court held, that under\ncontrolling precedent, burning \u201cother real property\u201d is a lesser\nincluded offense under Michigan law, and disproving the greater\noffense is not required.Id., at 416, 794 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at\n852 (citingPeoplev.Antonelli, 66 Mich. App. 138,\n140, 238 N.W.2d 551, 552 (1975) (on rehearing)).[2] The court thus explained it was\n\u201cundisputed that the trial court misperceived the elements of the\noffense with which [Evans] was charged and erred by directing a\nverdict.\u201d 288 Mich. App., at 416, 794 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 852.\nBut the court rejected Evans\u2019 argument that the Double Jeopardy\nClause barred retrial.Id., at 421\u2013422, 794 N.\u00a0W. 2d,\nat 856.In a divided decision, the Supreme Court of\nMichigan affirmed. It held that \u201cwhen a trial court grants a\ndefendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error\nof law that did not resolve any factual element of the charged\noffense, the trial court\u2019s ruling does not constitute an acquittal\nfor the purposes of double jeopardy and re- trial is therefore not\nbarred.\u201d 491 Mich., at 4, 810 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at 536\u2013537.We granted certiorari to resolve the\ndisagreement among state and federal courts on the question whether\nretrial is barred when a trial court grants an acquittal be- cause\nthe prosecution had failed to prove an \u201celement\u201d of the offense\nthat, in actuality, it did not have to prove.[3] 567 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2012). We now reverse.IIAIn answering this question, we do not write on\na clean slate. Quite the opposite. It has been half a century since\nwe first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial\nfollowing a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac- quittal is\n\u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u201dFong Foov.United States,369 U.S.\n141, 143 (1962) (per curiam). A mistaken acquittal is an\nacquittal nonetheless, and we have long held that \u201c[a] verdict of\nacquittal .\u00a0.\u00a0. could not be reviewed, on error or\notherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and\nthereby violating the Constitution.\u201dUnited Statesv.Ball,163 U.S.\n662, 671 (1896).Our cases have appliedFong Foo\u2019s\nprinciple broadly. An acquittal is unreviewable whether a judge\ndirects a jury to return a verdict of acquittal,e.g., Fong\nFoo, 369 U.\u00a0S., at 143, or forgoes that formality by\nentering a judgment of acquittal herself. SeeSmithv.Massachusetts,543 U.S.\n462, 467\u2013468 (2005) (collecting cases). And an acquittal\nprecludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous decision\nto exclude evidence,Sanabriav.United States,437 U.S.\n54, 68\u201369, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding of what evidence\nwould suffice to sustain a conviction,Smith, 543\nU.\u00a0S., at 473; or a \u201cmisconstruction of the stat- ute\u201d\ndefining the requirements to convict,Rumsey, 467\nU.\u00a0S., at 203, 211; cf.Smalisv.Pennsylvania,476 U.S.\n140, 144\u2013145, n.\u00a07 (1986). In all these circumstances,\n\u201cthe fact that the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary\nrulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles\naffects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter\nits essential character.\u201dUnited Statesv.Scott,437 U.S.\n82, 98 (1978) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).Most relevant here, our cases have defined an\nacquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense. Seeibid.,and n.\u00a011;Burksv.United States,437 U.S.\n1, 10 (1978);United Statesv.Martin Linen Supply\nCo.,430 U.S.\n564, 571 (1977). Thus an \u201cacquittal\u201d includes \u201ca ruling by the\ncourt that the evidence is insufficient to convict,\u201d a \u201cfactual\nfinding [that] necessarily establish[es] the criminal defendant\u2019s\nlack of criminal culpability,\u201d and any other \u201crulin[g] which\nrelate[s] to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\u201dScott,437 U.\u00a0S., at 91, 98, and n.\u00a011 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). These sorts of substantive rulings stand\napart from procedural rulings that may also terminate a case\nmidtrial, which we generally refer to as dismissals or mistrials.\nProcedural dismissals include rulings on questions that \u201care\nunrelated to factual guilt or innocence,\u201d but \u201cwhich serve other\npurposes,\u201d including \u201ca legal judgment that a defendant, although\ncriminally culpable, may not be punished\u201d because of some problem\nlike an error with the indictment.Id.,at 98, and\nn.\u00a011.Both procedural dismissals and substantive\nrulings result in an early end to trial, but we explained inScottthat the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.\n\u201c[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquittal,\u201d so a\nmerits-related ruling concludes proceedings absolutely.Id.,at 91. This is because \u201c[t]o permit a second trial after an\nacquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would\npresent an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its\nvastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that\n\u2018even though innocent he may be found guilty,\u2019\u00a0\u201dibid.(quotingGreenv.United States,355 U.S.\n184, 188 (1957)). And retrial following an acquittal would\nupset a defendant\u2019s ex- pectation of repose, for it would subject\nhim to additional \u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal\u201d while\n\u201ccompelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and\ninsecurity.\u201dId.,at 187. In contrast, a \u201ctermination of the\nproceedings against [a defendant] on a basis unrelated to factual\nguilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused,\u201d 437\nU.\u00a0S.,at 98\u201399,i.e.,some procedural ground,\ndoes not pose the same concerns, because no expectation of finality\nattaches to a properly granted mistrial.Here, \u201cit is plain that the [trial court]\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. evaluated the [State\u2019s] evidence and determined\nthat it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201dMartin Linen, 430 U.\u00a0S., at 572. The trial court\ngranted Evans\u2019 motion under a rule that requires the court to\n\u201cdirect a verdict of acquittal on any charged offense as to which\nthe evidence is insufficient to support conviction.\u201d Mich. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 6.419(A) (2012). And the court\u2019s oral ruling leaves no\ndoubt that it made its determination on the basis of \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he\ntestimony\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the State had presented. 491 Mich., at 8,\n810 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 539. This ruling was not a dismissal on\na procedural ground \u201cunrelated to factual guilt or innocence,\u201d like\nthe question of \u201cpreindictment delay\u201d inScott, but rather a\ndetermination that the State had failed to prove its case. 437\nU.\u00a0S., at 98, 99. Under our precedents, then, Evans was\nacquitted.There is no question the trial court\u2019s ruling\nwas wrong; it was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what\nfacts the State needed to prove under State law. But that is of no\nmoment.Martin Linen,Sanabria,Rumsey,Smalis, andSmithall instruct that an acquittal due\nto insufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court\u2019s\nevaluation of the evidence was \u201ccorrect or not,\u201dMartin\nLinen, 430 U.\u00a0S., at 571, and regardless of whether the\ncourt\u2019s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling of law.\nHere Evans\u2019 acquittal was the product of an \u201cerroneous\ninterpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,\u201d but as in our\nother cases, that error affects only \u201cthe accuracy of [the]\ndetermination\u201d to acquit, not \u201cits essential character.\u201dScott, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 98 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).BThe court below saw things differently. It\nidentified a \u201cconstitutionally meaningful difference\u201d between this\ncase and our previous decisions. Those cases, the court found,\n\u201cinvolve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed to\nestablish a factual element of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. crimes at\nissue,\u201d but still ultimately involved \u201ca resolution regarding the\nsufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.\u201d 491\nMich., at 14\u201315, 810 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 542\u2013543. When a court\nmistakenly \u201cidentifie[s] an extraneous element and dismisse[s] the\ncase solely on that basis,\u201d however, it has \u201cnot resolve[d] or even\naddress[ed] any factual element necessary to establish\u201d the\noffense.Id., at 15, 20, 810 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 543,\n546. As a result, the court below reasoned, the case terminates\n\u201cbased on an error of law unrelated to [the] defendant\u2019s guilt or\ninnocence on the ele-ments of the charged offense,\u201d and thus falls\noutside the definition of an acquittal.Id., at 21, 810\nN.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 546.We fail to perceive the difference. This case,\nlike our previous ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led\nto an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact it was\nnot actually required to prove. ConsiderRumsey. There the\ntrial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case involving a\nmurder committed during a robbery, mistakenly held that Arizona\u2019s\nstatutory aggravating factor describing killings for pecuniary gain\nwas limited to murders for hire. Accordingly, it found the State\nhad failed to prove the killing was for pecuniary gain and\nsentenced the defendant to life imprisonment. After the State\nsuccessfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand, we\nheld that retrial on the penalty phase question was a double\njeopardy violation.[4]The only relevant difference between that\nsituation and this one is that inRumseythe trial court\u2019s\nerror was called a \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d and a \u201cmisconstruction of\nthe statute,\u201d 467 U.\u00a0S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error\nhas been designated the \u201cerroneous addition of [an] extraneous\nelement to the charged offense.\u201d 491 Mich., at 3\u20134, 810\nN.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 536. But we have emphasized that labels do\nnot control our analysis in this context; rather, the substance of\na court\u2019s decision does. SeeSmalis, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 144,\nn.\u00a05;Scott, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 96\u201397;Martin\nLinen, 430 U.\u00a0S., at 571. The error inRumseycould\njust as easily have been characterized as the erroneous addition of\nan element of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that the\nhomicide be a murder-for-hire. Conversely, the error here could be\nviewed as a misinterpretation of the statute\u2019s phrase \u201cbuilding or\nother real property\u201d to exclude dwellings.[5] This is far too fine a distinction to be meaningful,\nand we reject the notion that a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\nwould turn on the happenstance of how an appellate court chooses to\ndescribe a trial court\u2019s error.Echoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State\nand the United States, as well as the dissent, emphasizeMartin\nLinen\u2019s description of an acquittal as the \u201cresolution, correct\nor not, of some or all of the factualelementsof theoffensecharged.\u201d 430 U.\u00a0S., at 571 (emphasis added);\nsee Brief for Respondent 11\u201317; see Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae11\u201315 (hereinafter U.\u00a0S. Brief); seepost,at 6\u20138. They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nprotects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same\n\u201coffence,\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl.\u00a02, and they note\nthat an offense comprises constituent parts called elements, which\nare facts that must be proved to sustain a conviction. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Dixon,509 U.S.\n688, 696\u2013697 (1993). Consequently, they argue, only if an\nactual element of the offense is resolved can it be said that there\nhas been an acquittal of the offense, because \u201c\u00a0\u2018innocence of\nthe charged offense\u2019 cannot turn on something that is concededly\nnot an element of the offense.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Brief 15. Because Evans\u2019\ntrial ended without resolution of even one actual element, they\nconclude, there was no acquittal.This argument readsMartin Linentoo\nnarrowly, and it is inconsistent with our decisions since then. Our\nfocus inMartin Linenwas on the significance of a judicial\nacquittal under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court in\nthat case had \u201cevaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and determined\nthat it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-viction.\u201d 430\nU.\u00a0S., at 572. That determination of nonculpability was enough\nto make the acquittal akin to a jury verdict; our holding did not\ndepend upon defining the \u201celements\u201d of the offense. As we have\nexplained,supra,at 5\u20136,Scottconfirms that the\nrelevant distinction is between judicial determinations that go to\n\u201cthe criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and those\nthat hold \u201cthat a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not\nbe punished because of a supposed\u201d procedural error. 437\nU.\u00a0S., at 98. Culpability (i.e.,the \u201cultimate question\nof guilt or innocence\u201d) is the touchstone, not whether any\nparticular elements were resolved or whether the determination of\nnonculpability was legally correct.Id.,at 98, n.\u00a011\n(internal quotation marks omitted).Perhaps most inconsistent with the State\u2019s and\nUnited States\u2019 argument isBurks. There we held that when a\ndefendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides the\n\u201cGovernment ha[s] failed to come forward with sufficient proof of\n[the defendant\u2019s] capacity to be responsible for criminal acts,\u201d\nthe defendant has been acquitted because the court decided that\n\u201ccriminal culpability ha[s] not been established.\u201d 437 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 10. Lack of insanity was not an \u201celement\u201d of Burks\u2019 offense,\nbank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon. See 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72113(d) (1976 ed.). Rather, insanity was an\naffirmative defense to criminal liability. Our conclusion thus\ndepended upon equating a judicial acquittal with an order finding\ninsufficient evidence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of\nany particular element of the offense.[6]In the end, this case follows those that have\ncome before it. The trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal resolved\nthe question of Evans\u2019 guilt or innocence as a matter of the\nsufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural grounds.\nThat judgment, \u201chowever erroneous\u201d it was, precludes reprosecution\non this charge, and so should have barred the State\u2019s appeal as\nwell.Sanabria, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 69.IIIAThe State, supported by the United States,\noffers three other reasons why the distinction drawn by the court\nbe- low should be maintained. None persuades us.To start, the State argues that unless an actual\nelement of the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way\nto know whether the court\u2019s ruling was an \u201cacquittal\u201d is to rely\nupon the label used by the court, which would wrongly allow the\nform of the trial court\u2019s action to control. Brief for Respondent\n17\u201318, 21\u201322. We disagree. Our decision turns not on the form of\nthe trial court\u2019s action, but rather whether it \u201cserve[s]\u201d\nsubstantive \u201cpurposes\u201d or procedural ones.Scott, 437\nU.\u00a0S., at 98, n.\u00a011. If a trial court were to announce,\nmidtrial, \u201cThe defendant shall be acquitted because he was\nprejudiced by preindictment delay,\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause\nwould pose no barrier to reprosecution, notwithstanding the\n\u201cacquittal\u201d label. Cf.Scott,437 U.S.\n82. Here we know the trial court acquitted Evans, not because\nit incanted the word \u201cacquit\u201d (which it did not), but because it\nacted on its view that the prosecution had failed to prove its\ncase.Next, the State and the United States fear that\nif the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual\nelements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unreviewable\norder finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at\nall, such as that the prosecution failed to prove \u201cthat the\nstructure burned [was] blue.\u201d Brief for Respondent 16\u201317;\nU.\u00a0S. Brief 15. If the concern is that there is no limit to\nthe magnitude of the error that could yield an acquittal, the\nresponse is that we have long held as much. Seesupra,at 4.\nIf the concern is instead that our holding will make it easier for\ncourts to insulate from review acquittals that are granted as a\nform of nullifi- cation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n.\u00a058,\nwe reject the premise. We presume here, as in other contexts, that\ncourts exercise their duties in good faith. Cf.Harringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n13).Finally, the State suggests that because Evans\ninduced the trial court\u2019s error, he should not be heard to complain\nwhen that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry him.\nBrief for Respondent 32\u201333; cf.id.,at 5\u20139. But we have\nrecognized that \u201cmost [judgments of acquittal] re- sult from\ndefense motions,\u201d so \u201c[t]o hold that a defendant waives his double\njeopardy protection whenever a trial court error in his favor on a\nmidtrial motion leads to an acquittal would undercut the adversary\nassumption on which our system of criminal justice rests, and would\nvitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the Fifth\nAmendment.\u201dSanabria, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 78 (citation\nomitted).[7] It is true that\nwhen a defendant persuades the court to declare a mistrial,\njeopardy continues and retrial is generally allowed. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Dinitz,424 U.S.\n600(1976). But in such circumstances the defendant consents to\na disposition that contemplates reprosecution, whereas when a\ndefendant moves for acquittal he does not. SeeSanabria, 437\nU.\u00a0S., at 75.The United States makes a related argument. It\ncontends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve whether\nnondwelling status is an element of the offense before jeopardy\nattached, so having elected to wait until trial was underway to\nraise the point, he cannot now claim a double jeopardy violation.\nU.\u00a0S. Brief 22\u201325. The Government relies uponLeev.United States,432 U.S.\n23(1977), in which the District Court dismissed an indictment\nmidtrial because it had failed to allege the required intent\nelement of the offense. We held that retrial on a corrected\nindictment was not barred, because the dismissal was akin to a\nmistrial, not an acquittal. This was clear because the District\nCourt had separately denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of\nacquittal, explaining that the defendant \u201c\u00a0\u2018has been proven\n[guilty] beyond any reasonable doubt in the world,\u2019\u00a0\u201d while\nacknowledging that the error in the indictment required dismissal.Id.,at 26\u201327. Because the defendant \u201cinvited the court to\ninterrupt the proceedings before formalizing a finding on the\nmerits\u201d by raising the indictment issue so late, we held the\nprinciples governing a defendant\u2019s consent to mistrial should\napply.Id.,at 28 (citingDinitz, 424 U.\u00a0S.\n600).The Government suggests the situation here is\n\u201cfunctionally similar,\u201d because \u201cidentifying the elements of an\noffense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency of a\ncharging document.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Brief 23. But we can- not ignore the\nfact that what the trial court actually did here was rule on the\nsufficiency of the State\u2019s proof, not the sufficiency of the\ninformation filed against him.Leedemonstrates that the two\nneed not rise or fall together. And even if the Government is\ncorrect that Evans could have challenged the charging document on\nthe same legal theory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the\nevidence, it matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion\nthat necessarily may not be made until trial is underway. Evans\ncannot be penalized for requesting from the court a ruling on the\nmerits of the State\u2019s case, as the Michigan Rules entitled him to\ndo; whether he could have also brought a distinct procedural\nobjection earlier on is beside the point.BIn the alternative, the State and the United\nStates ask us to reconsider our past decisions. Brief for\nRespondent 34\u201356 (suggesting overruling our cases since at leastFong Foo); U.\u00a0S. Brief 27\u201332 (suggesting overrulingSmith,Rumsey, andSmalis).[8] We declined to revisit our cases when the\nUnited States made a similar request inSmalis. 476\nU.\u00a0S., at 144; see Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriaeinSmalisv.Pennsylvania, O.\u00a0T.\n1985, No. 85\u2013227, pp.\u00a019\u201325. And we decline to do so here.First, we have no reason to believe the existing\nrules have become so \u201cunworkable\u201d as to justify overruling\nprecedent.Paynev.Tennessee,501 U.S.\n808, 827 (1991). The distinction drawn inScotthas\nstood the test of time, and we expect courts will continue to have\nlittle \u201cdifficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which\nrelate to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those\nwhich serve other purposes.\u201d 437 U.\u00a0S., at 98, n.\u00a011\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Dionisio, 503 F.3d 78, 83\u201388 (CA2 2007)\n(collecting cases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr,\nCriminal Procedure \u00a725.3(a), p. 629 (3d ed. 2007) (same).Second, the logic of these cases still holds.\nThere is no question that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes\nretrial, and thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led\nto that acquittal. SeeBall, 163 U.\u00a0S., at 671. So, had\nthe trial court here instructed the jury that it must find the\nburned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict, the jury\nwould have acquitted Evans accordingly; \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a] jury is\npresumed to follow its instructions.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBluefordv.Arkansas, 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6)\n(quotingWeeksv.Angelone,528\nU.S. 225, 234 (2000)). And that would have been the end of the\nmatter. From that premise,Fong Foo\u2019s holding follows: If a\ntrial court instead exercises its discretion to direct a jury to\nreturn a verdict of acquittal, jeopardy also terminates\nnotwithstanding any legal error, because there too it is the jury\nthat returns an acquittal. And from there,Martin Linen\u2019s\nconclusion is unavoidable: It should make no difference whether the\ncourt employs the formality of directing the jury to return an\nacquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal itself.Sanabria,Rumsey,Smalis, andSmithmerely applyFong FooandMartin Linenin tandem: If\na trial court makes an antecedent legal error (as inFong\nFoo), and then grants a judgment of acquittal rather than\ndirecting the jury to acquit (as inMartin Linen), the\nresult is an acquittal all the same.In other words, there is no way for antecedent\nlegal errors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals\nunless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise to jury\nacquittals (contrary to the settled understanding that a jury\nverdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless we distinguish\nbetween juries that acquit pursuant to their instructions and\njudicial acquittals (notwithstand- ing that this is a purely formal\ndistinction). Neither option has become more attractive with time.\nWe therefore reiterate: \u201cany contention that the Double Jeopardy\nClause must itself .\u00a0.\u00a0. leave open a way of correcting\nlegal errors is at odds with the well-established rule that the bar\nwill attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently wrong in\nlaw.\u201dSmith, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 473.Finally, the State and the United States object\nthat this rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity\nto present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant reaps a\n\u201cwindfall\u201d from the trial court\u2019s unreviewable error. Brief for\nRespondent 6; U.\u00a0S. Brief 31\u201332. But sovereigns are hardly\npowerless to prevent this sort of situation, as we observed inSmith, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 474. Nothing obligates a\njurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a\nmidtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the practice.\nSee Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7175.381(1) (2011);Statev.Parfait, 96, 1814 (La. App. 1 Cir. 05/09/97), 693 So. 2d\n1232, 1242. Many jurisdictions, including the federal system, allow\nor encourage their courts to defer consideration of a motion to\nacquit until after the jury returns a verdict, which mitigates\ndouble jeopardy concerns.[9]\nSee Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b). And for cases such as this, in\nwhich a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant criminal\nstatute is likely to prove dispositive, we see no reason why\njurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances or\nexpedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to prevent misguided\nacquittals from being entered.[10] But having chosen to vest its courts with the power\nto grant midtrial acquittals, the State must bear the corresponding\nrisk that some acquittals will be granted in error.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that Evans\u2019 trial ended in an\nacquittal when the trial court ruled the State had failed to\nproduce sufficient evidence of his guilt. The Double Jeopardy\nClause thus bars retrial for his offense and should have barred the\nState\u2019s appeal. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan\nisReversed.Notes1Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.72\n(1981), \u201cBurning dwelling house,\u201d provides: \u201cAny person who\nwilfully or maliciously burns any dwelling house, either occupied\nor unoccupied, or the contents thereof, whether owned by himself or\nanother, or any building within the curtilage of such dwelling\nhouse, or the contents thereof, shall be guilty of a felony,\npunishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 20\nyears.\u201d And \u00a7750.73, \u201cBurning of other real property,\u201d provides:\n\u201cAny person who wilfully or maliciously burns any building or other\nreal property, or the contents thereof, other than those specified\nin the next preceding section of this chapter, the property of\nhimself or another, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by\nimprisonment in the state prison for not more than 10\nyears.\u201d2In other words, the\npattern jury instructions were incorrect. The State later revised\nthem. See 288 Mich. App. 410, 416, n.\u00a03, 794 N.W.2d 848, 852,\nn.\u00a03 (2010).3Compare 491 Mich. 1, 810\nN.W.2d 535 (2012) (case below), andStatev.Korsen,\n138 Idaho 706, 716\u2013717, 69 P.3d 126, 136\u2013137 (2003) (same\nconclusion), andUnited Statesv.Maker, 751 F.2d\n614, 624 (CA3 1984) (same), withCarterv.State, 365\nArk. 224, 228, 227 S.W.3d 895, 898 (2006) (rejecting this\ndistinction), andStatev.Lynch, 79 N.\u00a0J. 327,\n337\u2013343,399 A.2d 629, 634\u2013637 (1979) (holding double jeopardy barred\nretrial after trial court erroneously required extra\nelement).4UnderBullingtonv.Missouri,451 U.S.\n430(1981), a capital defendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d of the death\npenalty if, at the end of a separate sentencing proceeding, the\nfactfinder concludes that the prosecution has failed to prove\nrequired additional facts to support a sentence of death. Thus inRumsey, the trial court\u2019s initial \u201cjudgment, based on\nfindings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life\nsentence, amounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars\nany retrial of the appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d 467\nU.\u00a0S., at 211.5Indeed, it is possible\nthat this is what the trial court thought it was doing, not\narticulating an additional element. The statute criminalizes\nburning \u201cany building or other real property, .\u00a0.\u00a0. other\nthan those specified in\u201d the previous section, which criminalizes\nthe burning of a dwelling house. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73. In light\nof the statute\u2019s phrasing, the trial court interpreted \u201cbuilding or\nother real property\u201d to be exclusive of the type of property\ndescribed in \u00a7750.72, although the Michigan courts have explained\nthat the term is actually meant to be inclusive. So the trial court\ndecision could be viewed as having given the statutory \u201cbuilding\u201d\nelement an unduly narrow construction (by limiting it to\nnondwellings), just as the trial court inRumseygave the\npecuniary-gain provision an unduly narrow construction (by limiting\nit to contract killings). Nevertheless, we accept the parties\u2019 and\nthe Michigan courts\u2019 alternative characterization of the trial\ncourt\u2019s error as the \u201caddition\u201d of an extraneous element. Our\nobservation simply underscores how malleable the distinction\nadopted by the Michigan Supreme Court, and defended by the State\nand the United States, can be. And it belies the dissent\u2019s\nsuggestion,post,at 11 (opinion of Alito, J.), that drawing\nthis distinction is \u201cquite easy\u201d here, and that the basis for the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling could not be subject to \u201creal\ndispute.\u201d6To account forBurks, the United States posits that, \u201c[a]s used in [its]\nbrief, the \u2018elements\u2019 of an offense encompass legally recognized\ndefenses that would negate culpability.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Brief 11,\nn.\u00a03. So too would the dissent hold that, \u201cas used in this\nopinion, the \u2018elements\u2019 of an offense include legally recognized\naffirmative defenses that would negate culpability.\u201dPost,at 8, n.\u00a02. Rather than adopt a novel definition of the word\n\u201celement\u201d to mean \u201celements and affirmative defenses,\u201d and then\npromptly limit that novel definition to these circumstances, we\nprefer to readBurksfor what it says, which is that the\nissue is whether the bottom-line question of \u201ccriminal culpability\u201d\nwas resolved. 437 U.\u00a0S., at 10.7The dissent says that\n\u201cdefense counsel fooled the judge,\u201dpost,at 6, but surely\nthat charge is not fair. Nothing suggests counsel exceeded the\npermissible bounds of zealous advocacy on behalf of his client.\nCounsel presented a colorable legal argument, and marshaled\npersuasive authority: Michigan\u2019s own criminal jury instructions,\nwhich, at the time, supported his position. Seesupra,at 2,\n3, n.\u00a02.8The dissent\u2019s true gripe\nmay be with these cases as well, rather than our result here,\nwhich, we have explained, follows inevitably from them. Seepost,at 5 (noting \u201chow far [our cases] have departed from\nthe common-law principles that applied at the time of the\nfounding\u201d); comparepost,at 12 (\u201cPermitting retrial in\nthese egregious cases is especially appropriate\u201d), withFong\nFoov.United States,369 U.S.\n141, 143 (1962) (per curiam) (according finality to even\nthose acquittals \u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous\nfoundation\u201d).9If a court grants a\nmotion to acquit after the jury has convicted, there is no double\njeopardy barrier to an appeal by the government from the court\u2019s\nacquittal, because reversal would result in reinstatement of the\njury verdict of guilt, not a new trial.United Statesv.Wilson,420 U.S.\n332(1975).10Here,\nthe prosecutor twice asked the court for a recess to review the\nMichigan statutes and to discuss the question with her supervisor.\n491 Mich., at 7, 810 N.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 538\u2013539. If the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal was ill-advised, that is a matter for state\nprocedure to address, but it does not bear on the double jeopardy\nconsequences of the acquittal that followed.",
