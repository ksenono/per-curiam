In organizing the\nCFPB, Congress deviated from the structure of nearly every other\nindependent administrative agency in our history. Instead of\nplacing the agency under the leadership of a board with multiple\nmembers, Congress provided that the CFPB would be led by a single\nDirector, who serves for a longer term than the President and\ncannot be removed by the President except for inefficiency,\nneglect, or malfeasance. The CFPB Director has no boss, peers, or\nvoters to report to. Yet the Director wields vast rulemaking,\nenforcement, and adjudicatory authority over a significant portion\nof the U.\u00a0S. economy. The question before us is whether this\narrangement violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.Under our Constitution, the \u201cexecutive\nPower\u201d\u2014all of it\u2014is \u201cvested in a President,\u201d who must \u201ctake Care\nthat the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl. 1;id., \u00a73. Because no single person could fulfill that\nresponsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would\nrely on subordinate officers for assistance. Ten years ago, inFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477(2010), we reiterated that, \u201cas a general matter,\u201d the\nConstitution gives the President \u201cthe authority to remove those who\nassist him in carrying out his duties,\u201did., at 513\u2013514.\n\u201cWithout such power, the President could not be held fully\naccountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck\nwould stop somewhere else.\u201dId., at 514.The President\u2019s power to remove\u2014and thus\nsupervise\u2014those who wield executive power on his behalf follows\nfrom the text of Article II, was settled by the First Congress, and\nwas confirmed in the landmark decisionMyersv.United\nStates,272 U.S.\n52(1926). Our precedents have recognized only two exceptions\nto the President\u2019s unrestricted removal power. InHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorv.United States,295 U.S.\n602(1935), we held that Congress could create expert agencies\nled by agroupof principal officers removable by the\nPresident only for good cause. And inUnited Statesv.Perkins,116 U.S.\n483(1886), andMorrisonv.Olson,487 U.S.\n654(1988), we held that Congress could provide tenure\nprotections to certaininferiorofficers with narrowly\ndefined duties.We are now asked to extend these precedents to a\nnew configuration: an independent agency that wields significant\nexecutive power and is run by a single individual who cannot be\nremoved by the President unless certain statutory criteria are met.\nWe decline to take that step. While we need not and do not revisit\nour prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President\u2019s\nremoval power, there are compelling reasons not to extend those\nprecedents to the novel context of an independent agency led by a\nsingle Director. Such an agency lacks a foundation in historical\npractice and clashes with constitutional structure by concentrating\npower in a unilateral actor insulated from Presidential\ncontrol.We therefore hold that the structure of the CFPB\nviolates the separation of powers. We go on to hold that the CFPB\nDirector\u2019s removal protection is severable from the other statutory\nprovisions bearing on the CFPB\u2019s authority. The agency may\ntherefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our\ndecision, must be removable by the President at will.IAIn the summer of 2007, then-Professor\nElizabeth Warren called for the creation of a new, independent\nfederal agency focused on regulating consumer financial products.\nWarren, Unsafe at Any Rate, Democracy (Summer 2007). Professor\nWarren believed the financial products marketed to ordinary\nAmerican households\u2014credit cards, student loans, mortgages, and the\nlike\u2014had grown increasingly unsafe due to a \u201cregulatory jumble\u201d\nthat paid too much attention to banks and too little to consumers.Ibid.To remedy the lack of \u201ccoherent, consumer-oriented\u201d\nfinancial regulation, she proposed \u201cconcentrat[ing] the review of\nfinancial products in a single location\u201d\u2014an independent agency\nmodeled after the multimember Consumer Product Safety Commission.Ibid.That proposal soon met its moment. Within months\nof Professor Warren\u2019s writing, the subprime mortgage market\ncollapsed, precipitating a financial crisis that wiped out over $10\ntrillion in American household wealth and cost millions of\nAmericans their jobs, their retirements, and their homes. In the\naftermath, the Obama administration embraced Professor Warren\u2019s\nrecommendation. Through the Treasury Department, the administration\nencouraged Congress to establish an agency with a mandate to ensure\nthat \u201cconsumer protection regulations\u201d in the financial sector \u201care\nwritten fairly and enforced vigorously.\u201d Dept. of Treasury,\nFinancial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation 55 (2009). Like\nProfessor Warren, the administration envisioned a traditional\nindependent agency, run by a multimember board with a \u201cdiverse set\nof viewpoints and experiences.\u201dId., at 58.In 2010, Congress acted on these proposals and\ncreated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an\nindependent financial regulator within the Federal Reserve System.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(Dodd-Frank), 124Stat. 1376. Congress tasked the CFPB with\n\u201cimplement[ing]\u201d and \u201cenforc[ing]\u201d a large body of financial\nconsumer protection laws to \u201censur[e] that all consumers have\naccess to markets for consumer financial products and services and\nthat markets for consumer financial products and services are fair,\ntransparent, and competitive.\u201d 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75511(a).\nCongress transferred the administration of 18 existing federal\nstatutes to the CFPB, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Truth in Lending Act.\nSee \u00a7\u00a75512(a), 5481(12), (14). In addition, Congress enacted a new\nprohibition on \u201cany unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice\u201d\nby certain participants in the consumer-finance sector.\n\u00a75536(a)(1)(B). Congress authorized the CFPB to implement that\nbroad standard (and the 18 pre-existing statutes placed under the\nagency\u2019s purview) through binding regulations. \u00a7\u00a75531(a)\u2013(b),\n5581(a)(1)(A), (b).Congress also vested the CFPB with potent\nenforcement powers. The agency has the authority to conduct\ninvestigations, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands,\ninitiate administrative adjudications, and prosecute civil actions\nin federal court. \u00a7\u00a75562, 5564(a), (f\u00a0). To remedy violations\nof federal consumer financial law, the CFPB may seek restitution,\ndisgorgement, and injunctive relief, as well as civil penalties of\nup to $1,000,000 (inflation adjusted) for each day that a violation\noccurs. \u00a7\u00a75565(a), (c)(2); 12 CFR \u00a71083.1(a), Table (2019). Since\nits inception, the CFPB has obtained over $11 billion in relief for\nover 25 million consumers, including a $1 billion penalty against a\nsingle bank in 2018. See CFPB, Financial Report of the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, Fiscal Year 2015, p. 3; CFPB, Bureau\nof Consumer Financial Protection Announces Settlement With Wells\nFargo for Auto-Loan Administration and Mortgage Practices (Apr. 20,\n2018).The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement powers are\ncoupled with extensive adjudicatory authority. The agency may\nconduct administrative proceedings to \u201censure or enforce compliance\nwith\u201d the statutes and regulations it administers. 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75563(a). When the CFPB acts as an adjudicator,\nit has \u201cjurisdiction to grant any appropriate legal or equitable\nrelief.\u201d \u00a75565(a)(1). The \u201chearing officer\u201d who presides over the\nproceedings may issue subpoenas, order depositions, and resolve any\nmotions filed by the parties. 12 CFR \u00a71081.104(b). At the close of\nthe proceedings, the hearing officer issues a \u201crecommended\ndecision,\u201d and the CFPB Director considers that recommendation and\n\u201cissue[s] a final decision and order.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71081.400(d), 1081.402(b);\nsee also \u00a71081.405.Congress\u2019s design for the CFPB differed from the\nproposals of Professor Warren and the Obama administration in one\ncritical respect. Rather than create a traditional independent\nagency headed by a multimember board or commission, Congress\nelected to place the CFPB under the leadership of a single\nDirector. 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75491(b)(1). The CFPB Director is\nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the\nSenate. \u00a75491(b)(2). The Director serves for a term of five years,\nduring which the President may remove the Director from office only\nfor \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a75491(c)(1), (3).Unlike most other agencies, the CFPB does not\nrely on the annual appropriations process for funding. Instead, the\nCFPB receives funding directly from the Federal Reserve, which is\nitself funded outside the appropriations process through bank\nassessments. Each year, the CFPB requests an amount that the\nDirector deems \u201creasonably necessary to carry out\u201d the agency\u2019s\nduties, and the Federal Reserve grants that request so long as it\ndoes not exceed 12% of the total operating expenses of the Federal\nReserve (inflation adjusted). \u00a7\u00a75497(a)(1), (2)(A)(iii), 2(B). In\nrecent years, the CFPB\u2019s annual budget has exceeded half a billion\ndollars. See CFPB, Fiscal Year 2019: Ann. Performance Plan and\nRep., p. 7.BSeila Law LLC is a California-based law firm\nthat provides debt-related legal services to clients. In 2017, the\nCFPB issued a civil investigative demand to Seila Law to determine\nwhether the firm had \u201cengag[ed] in unlawful acts or practices in\nthe advertising, marketing, or sale of debt relief services.\u201d 2017\nWL 6536586, *1 (CD Cal., Aug. 25, 2017). See also 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75562(c)(1) (authorizing the agency to issue\nsuch demands to persons who \u201cmay have any information[\u00a0]\nrelevant to a violation\u201d of one of the laws enforced by the CFPB).\nThe demand (essentially a subpoena) directed Seila Law to produce\ninformation and documents related to its business practices.Seila Law asked the CFPB to set aside the\ndemand, objecting that the agency\u2019s leadership by a single Director\nremovable only for cause violated the separation of powers. The\nCFPB declined to address that claim and directed Seila Law to\ncomply with the demand.When Seila Law refused, the CFPB filed a\npetition to enforce the demand in the District Court. See\n\u00a75562(e)(1) (creating cause of action for that purpose). In\nresponse, Seila Law renewed its defense that the demand was invalid\nand must be set aside because the CFPB\u2019s structure violated the\nConstitution. The District Court disagreed and ordered Seila Law to\ncomply with the demand (with one modification not relevant\nhere).The Court of Appeals affirmed. 923 F.3d 680 (CA9\n2019). The Court observed that the \u201carguments for and against\u201d the\nconstitutionality of the CFPB\u2019s structure had already been\n\u201cthoroughly canvassed\u201d in majority, concurring, and dissenting\nopinions by the en banc Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit inPHH Corp.v.CFPB, 881 F.3d 75\n(2018), which had rejected a challenge similar to the one presented\nhere. 923 F.\u00a03d, at 682. The Court saw \u201cno need to re-plow the\nsame ground.\u201dIbid.Instead, it provided a brief explanation\nfor why it agreed with thePHHCourt\u2019s core holding. The\nCourt took as its starting pointHumphrey\u2019s Executor, which\nhad approved for-cause removal protection for the Commissioners of\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In applying that precedent, the\nCourt recognized that the CFPB wields \u201csubstantially more executive\npower than the FTC did back in 1935\u201d and that the CFPB\u2019s leadership\nby a single Director (as opposed to a multimember commission)\npresented a \u201cstructural difference\u201d that some jurists had found\n\u201cdispositive.\u201d 923 F.\u00a03d, at 683\u2013684. But the Court felt bound\nto disregard those differences in light of our decision inMorrison, which permitted a single individual (an\nindependent counsel) to exercise a core executive power\n(prosecuting criminal offenses) despite being insulated from\nremoval except for cause. Because the Court foundHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutorandMorrison\u201ccontrolling,\u201d it affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order requiring compliance with the demand. 923\nF.\u00a03d, at 684.We granted certiorari to address the\nconstitutionality of the CFPB\u2019s structure. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019). We also requested argument on an additional question:\nwhether, if the CFPB\u2019s structure violates the separation of powers,\nthe CFPB Director\u2019s removal protection can be severed from the rest\nof the Dodd-Frank Act.Because the Government agrees with petitioner on\nthe merits of the constitutional question, we appointed Paul\nClement to defend the judgment below asamicus curiae. He\nhas ably discharged his responsibilities.IIWe first consider three threshold arguments\nraised by the appointedamicusfor why we may not or should\nnot reach the merits. Each is unavailing.First,amicusargues that the demand\nissued to petitioner is not \u201ctraceable\u201d to the alleged\nconstitutional defect because two of the three Directors who have\nin turn played a role in enforcing the demand were (or now consider\nthemselves to be) removable by the President at will. Brief for\nCourt-AppointedAmicus Curiae21\u201324.Amicushighlights the Government\u2019s argument below that the demand,\noriginally issued by former Director Richard Cordray, had been\nratified by anactingCFPB Director who, according to the\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC), was removable by the President at\nwill. See Brief for Appellee in No. 17\u201356324 (CA9), pp. 1, 10,\n13\u201319 (citing Designating an Acting Director of the Bureau of\nConsumer Financial Protection, 41 Op. OLC ___, ___ (Nov. 25,\n2017)).Amicusfurther observes that current CFPB Director\nKathleen Kraninger, now responsible for enforcing the demand,\nagrees with the Solicitor General\u2019s position in this case that her\nfor-cause removal protection is unconstitutional. See Brief for\nRespondent on Pet. for Cert. 20; Letter from K. Kraninger, CFPB\nDirector, to M. McConnell, Majority Leader, U.\u00a0S. Senate, p. 2\n(Sept. 17, 2019); Letter from K. Kraninger, CFPB Director, to N.\nPelosi, Speaker, U.\u00a0S. House of Representatives, p. 2 (Sept.\n17, 2019).[1] Inamicus\u2019\nview, these developments reveal that the demand would have been\nissued\u2014and would continue to be enforced\u2014even in the absence of the\nCFPB Director\u2019s removal protection, making the asserted separation\nof powers dispute \u201cartificial.\u201d Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus\nCuriae22.Even if that were true, it would not deprive us\nof jurisdiction.Amicus\u2019 traceability argument appears to\nchallenge petitioner\u2019s Article III standing. SeeLujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U.S.\n555, 560 (1992) (explaining that the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s injury\nmust be \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged action of the\ndefendant\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Butamicus\u2019 argument does not cast any doubt on the jurisdiction\nof the District Court because petitioner isthe defendantand did not invoke the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. SeeBondv.United States,564 U.S.\n211, 217 (2011) (When the plaintiff has standing, \u201cArticle III\ndoes not restrict the opposing party\u2019s ability to object to relief\nbeing sought at its expense.\u201d).It is true that \u201cstanding must be met by persons\nseeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons\nappearing in courts of first instance.\u201dHollingsworthv.Perry,570 U.S.\n693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). But\npetitioner\u2019s appellate standing is beyond dispute. Petitioner is\ncompelled to comply with the civil investigative demand and to\nprovide documents it would prefer to withhold, a concrete injury.\nThat injury is traceable to the decision below and would be fully\nredressed if we were to reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand with instructions to deny the Government\u2019s\npetition to enforce the demand.Without engaging with these principles,amicuscontends that a litigant wishing to challenge an\nexecutive act on the basis of the President\u2019s removal power must\nshow that the challenged act would not have been taken if the\nresponsible official had been subject to the President\u2019s control.\nSee Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae21\u201324. Our\nprecedents say otherwise. We have held that a litigant challenging\ngovernmental action as void on the basis of the separation of\npowers is not required to prove that the Government\u2019s course of\nconduct would have been different in a \u201ccounterfactual world\u201d in\nwhich the Government had acted with constitutional authority.Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 512, n.\u00a012. In\nthe specific context of the President\u2019s removal power, we have\nfound it sufficient that the challenger \u201csustain[s] injury\u201d from an\nexecutive act that allegedly exceeds the official\u2019s authority.Bowsherv.Synar,478 U.S.\n714, 721 (1986).Second,amicuscontends that the proper\ncontext for assessing the constitutionality of an officer\u2019s removal\nrestriction is a contested removal. See Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae24\u201327. While that is certainly one way to\nreview a removal restriction, it is not the only way. Our\nprecedents have long permitted private parties aggrieved by an\nofficial\u2019s exercise of executive power to challenge the official\u2019s\nauthority to wield that power while insulated from removal by the\nPresident. SeeBowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 721 (lawsuit\nfiled by aggrieved third party in the absence of contested\nremoval);Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 487\n(same);Morrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 668\u2013669 (defense to\nsubpoena asserted by third party in the absence of contested\nremoval). Indeed, we have expressly \u201creject[ed]\u201d the \u201cargument that\nconsideration of the effect of a removal provision is not \u2018ripe\u2019\nuntil that provision is actually used,\u201d because when such a\nprovision violates the separation of powers it inflicts a\n\u201chere-and-now\u201d injury on affected third parties that can be\nremedied by a court.Bowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 727,\nn.\u00a05 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals\ntherefore correctly entertained petitioner\u2019s constitutional defense\non the merits.Lastly,amicuscontends that we should\ndismiss the case because the parties agree on the merits of the\nconstitutional question and the case therefore lacks \u201cadverseness.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 42\u201343, 45\u201346. That contention, however, is\nforeclosed byUnited Statesv.Windsor,570 U.S.\n744(2013). There, we explained that a lower court order that\npresents real-world consequences for the Government and its\nadversary suffices to support Article III jurisdiction\u2014even if \u201cthe\nExecutive may welcome\u201d an adverse order that \u201cis accompanied by the\nconstitutional ruling it wants.\u201dId., at 758. Here,\npetitioner and the Government disagree about whether petitioner\nmust comply with the civil investigative demand. The lower courts\nsided with the Government, and the Government has not volunteered\nto relinquish that victory and withdraw the demand. To the\ncontrary, while the Government agrees that the agency is\nunconstitutionally structured, it believes it may nevertheless\nenforce the demand on remand. Seeinfra, at 30. Accordingly,\nour \u201cdecision will have real meaning\u201d for the parties.INSv.Chadha,462 U.S.\n919, 939 (1983). And, as inWindsor, any prudential\nconcerns with deciding an important legal question in this posture\ncan be addressed by \u201cthe practice of entertaining arguments made by\nanamicuswhen the Solicitor General confesses error with\nrespect to a judgment below,\u201d which we have done. 570 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 760.We therefore turn to the merits of petitioner\u2019s\nconstitutional challenge.IIIWe hold that the CFPB\u2019s leadership by a single\nindividual removable only for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance\nviolates the separation of powers.AArticle II provides that \u201c[t]he executive\nPower shall be vested in a President,\u201d who must \u201ctake Care that the\nLaws be faithfully executed.\u201d Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl. 1;id.,\n\u00a73. The entire \u201cexecutive Power\u201d belongs to the President alone.\nBut because it would be \u201cimpossib[le]\u201d for \u201cone man\u201d to \u201cperform\nall the great business of the State,\u201d the Constitution assumes that\nlesser executive officers will \u201cassist the supreme Magistrate in\ndischarging the duties of his trust.\u201d 30 Writings of George\nWashington 334 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1939).These lesser officers must remain accountable to\nthe President, whose authority they wield. As Madison explained,\n\u201c[I]f any power whatsoever is in its nature Executive, it is the\npower of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute\nthe laws.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789). That power, in turn,\ngenerally includes the ability to remove executive officials, for\nit is \u201conly the authority that can remove\u201d such officials that they\n\u201cmust fear and, in the performance of [their] functions, obey.\u201dBowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 726 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).The President\u2019s removal power has long been\nconfirmed by history and precedent. It \u201cwas discussed extensively\nin Congress when the first executive departments were created\u201d in\n1789.Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 492. \u201cThe\nview that \u2018prevailed, as most consonant to the text of the\nConstitution\u2019 and \u2018to the requisite responsibility and harmony in\nthe Executive Department,\u2019 was that the executive power included a\npower to oversee executive officers through removal.\u201dIbid.(quoting Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (June 30,\n1789), 16 Documentary History of the First Federal Congress 893\n(2004)). The First Congress\u2019s recognition of the President\u2019s\nremoval power in 1789 \u201cprovides contemporaneous and weighty\nevidence of the Constitution\u2019s meaning,\u201dBowsher, 478\nU.\u00a0S., at 723 (internal quotation marks omitted), and has long\nbeen the \u201csettled and well understood construction of the\nConstitution,\u201dEx\u00a0parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259\n(1839).The Court recognized the President\u2019s prerogative\nto remove executive officials inMyersv.United\nStates,272 U.S.\n52. Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court, conducted an\nexhaustive examination of the First Congress\u2019s determination in\n1789, the views of the Framers and their contemporaries, historical\npractice, and our precedents up until that point. He concluded that\nArticle II \u201cgrants to the President\u201d the \u201cgeneral administrative\ncontrol of those executing the laws, including the power of\nappointmentand removalof executive officers.\u201dId.,\nat 163\u2013164 (emphasis added). Just as the President\u2019s \u201cselection of\nadministrative officers is essential to the execution of the laws\nby him, so must be his power of removing those for whom he cannot\ncontinue to be responsible.\u201dId., at 117. \u201c[T]o hold\notherwise,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cwould make it impossible for the\nPresident .\u00a0.\u00a0. to take care that the laws be faithfully\nexecuted.\u201dId., at 164.We recently reiterated the President\u2019s general\nremoval power inFree Enterprise Fund. \u201cSince 1789,\u201d we\nrecapped, \u201cthe Constitution has been understood to empower the\nPresident to keep these officers accountable\u2014by removing them from\noffice, if necessary.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 483. Although we had\npreviously sustained congressional limits on that power in certain\ncircumstances, we declined to extend those limits to \u201ca new\nsituation not yet encountered by the Court\u201d\u2014an official insulated\nbytwolayers of for-cause removal protection.Id.,at 483, 514. In the face of that novel impediment to the\nPresident\u2019s oversight of the Executive Branch, we adhered to the\ngeneral rule that the President possesses \u201cthe authority to remove\nthose who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u201dId.,at\n513\u2013514.Free Enterprise Fundleft in place two\nexceptions to the President\u2019s unrestricted removal power. First, inHumphrey\u2019s Executor, decided less than a decade afterMyers, the Court upheld a statute that protected the\nCommissioners of the FTC from removal except for \u201cinefficiency,\nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S., at 620\n(quoting 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741). In reaching that conclusion,\nthe Court stressed that Congress\u2019s ability to impose such removal\nrestrictions \u201cwill depend upon the character of the office.\u201d 295\nU.\u00a0S., at 631.Because the Court limited its holding \u201cto\nofficers of the kind here under consideration,\u201did.,at 632,\nthe contours of theHumphrey\u2019s Executorexception depend\nupon the characteristics of the agency before the Court. Rightly or\nwrongly, the Court viewed the FTC (as it existed in 1935) as\nexercising \u201cno part of the executive power.\u201dId.,at 628.\nInstead, it was \u201can administrative body\u201d that performed \u201cspecified\nduties as a legislative or as a judicial aid.\u201dIbid.It\nacted \u201cas a legislative agency\u201d in \u201cmaking investigations and\nreports\u201d to Congress and \u201cas an agency of the judiciary\u201d in making\nrecommendations to courts as a master in chancery.Ibid.\u201cTo\nthe extent that [the FTC] exercise[d] any executivefunction[,] as distinguished from executivepowerin\nthe constitutional sense,\u201d it did so only in the discharge of its\n\u201cquasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).[2]The Court identified several organizational\nfeatures that helped explain its characterization of the FTC as\nnon-executive. Composed of five members\u2014no more than three from the\nsame political party\u2014the Board was designed to be \u201cnon-partisan\u201d\nand to \u201cact with entire impartiality.\u201dId., at 624; seeid., at 619\u2013620. The FTC\u2019s duties were \u201cneither political\nnor executive,\u201d but instead called for \u201cthe trained judgment of a\nbody of experts\u201d \u201cinformed by experience.\u201dId., at 624\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And the Commissioners\u2019\nstaggered, seven-year terms enabled the agency to accumulate\ntechnical expertise and avoid a \u201ccomplete change\u201d in leadership \u201cat\nany one time.\u201dIbid.In short,Humphrey\u2019s Executorpermitted\nCongress to give for-cause removal protections to a multimember\nbody of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed\nlegislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any\nexecutive power. Consistent with that understanding, the Court\nlater applied \u201c[t]he philosophy ofHumphrey\u2019s Executor\u201d to\nuphold for-cause removal protections for the members of the War\nClaims Commission\u2014a three-member \u201cadjudicatory body\u201d tasked with\nresolving claims for compensation arising from World War II.Wienerv.United States,357\nU.S. 349, 356 (1958).While recognizing an exception for multimember\nbodies with \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d or \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d functions,Humphrey\u2019s Executorreaffirmed the core holding ofMyersthat the President has \u201cunrestrictable power\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to remove purely executive officers.\u201d 295\nU.\u00a0S., at 632. The Court acknowledged that between purely\nexecutive officers on the one hand, and officers that closely\nresembled the FTC Commissioners on the other, there existed \u201ca\nfield of doubt\u201d that the Court left \u201cfor future consideration.\u201dIbid.We have recognized a second exception forinferiorofficers in two cases,United Statesv.PerkinsandMorrisonv.Olson.[3] InPerkins, we upheld tenure\nprotections for a naval cadet-engineer. 116 U.\u00a0S., at 485.\nAnd, inMorrison, we upheld a provision granting good-cause\ntenure protection to an independent counsel appointed to\ninvestigate and prosecute particular alleged crimes by high-ranking\nGovernment officials. 487 U.\u00a0S., at 662\u2013663, 696\u2013697. Backing\naway from the reliance inHumphrey\u2019s Executoron the\nconcepts of \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d power, we\nviewed the ultimate question as whether a removal restriction is of\n\u201csuch a nature that [it] impede[s] the President\u2019s ability to\nperform his constitutional duty.\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S., at 691. Although\nthe independent counsel was a single person and performed \u201claw\nenforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by\nofficials within the Executive Branch,\u201d we concluded that the\nremoval protections did not unduly interfere with the functioning\nof the Executive Branch because \u201cthe independent counsel [was] an\ninferior officer under the Appointments Clause, with limited\njurisdiction and tenure and lacking policymaking or significant\nadministrative authority.\u201dIbid.These two exceptions\u2014one for multimember expert\nagencies that do not wield substantial executive power, and one for\ninferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or\nadministrative authority\u2014\u201crepresent what up to now have been the\noutermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional\nrestrictions on the President\u2019s removal power.\u201dPHH, 881\nF.\u00a03d, at 196 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).BNeitherHumphrey\u2019s ExecutornorMorrisonresolves whether the CFPB Director\u2019s insulation\nfrom removal is constitutional. Start withHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor.Unlike the New Deal-era FTC upheld there, the CFPB is\nled by a single Director who cannot be described as a \u201cbody of\nexperts\u201d and cannot be considered \u201cnon-partisan\u201d in the same sense\nas a group of officials drawn from both sides of the aisle. 295\nU.\u00a0S., at 624. Moreover, while the staggered terms of the FTC\nCommissioners prevented complete turnovers in agency leadership and\nguaranteed that there would always be some Commissioners who had\naccrued significant expertise, the CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure\nand five-year term guarantee abrupt shifts in agency leadership and\nwith it the loss of accumulated expertise.In addition, the CFPB Director is hardly a mere\nlegislative or judicial aid. Instead of making reports and\nrecommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did, the Director\npossesses the authority to promulgate binding rules fleshing out 19\nfederal statutes, including a broad prohibition on unfair and\ndeceptive practices in a major segment of the U.\u00a0S. economy.\nAnd instead of submitting recommended dispositions to an Article\nIII court, the Director may unilaterally issue final decisions\nawarding legal and equitable relief in administrative\nadjudications. Finally, the Director\u2019s enforcement authority\nincludes the power to seek daunting monetary penalties against\nprivate parties on behalf of the United States in federal court\u2014a\nquintessentially executive power not considered inHumphrey\u2019s\nExecutor.[4]The logic ofMorrisonalso does not\napply. Everyone agrees the CFPB Director is not an inferior\nofficer, and her duties are far from limited. Unlike the\nindependent counsel, who lacked policymaking or administrative\nauthority, the Director has the sole responsibility to administer\n19 separate consumer-protection statutes that cover everything from\ncredit cards and car payments to mortgages and student loans. It is\ntrue that the independent counsel inMorrisonwas empowered\nto initiate criminal investigations and prosecutions, and in that\nrespect wielded core executive power. But that power, while\nsignificant, was trained inward to high-ranking Governmental actors\nidentified by others, and was confined to a specified matter in\nwhich the Department of Justice had a potential conflict of\ninterest. By contrast, the CFPB Director has the authority to bring\nthe coercive power of the state to bear on millions of private\ncitizens and businesses, imposing even billion-dollar penalties\nthrough administrative adjudications and civil actions.In light of these differences, the\nconstitutionality of the CFPB Director\u2019s insulation from removal\ncannot be settled byHumphrey\u2019s ExecutororMorrisonalone.CThe question instead is whether to extend\nthose precedents to the \u201cnew situation\u201d before us, namely an\nindependent agency led by a single Director and vested with\nsignificant executive power.Free Enterprise Fund, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 483. We decline to do so. Such an agency has no\nbasis in history and no place in our constitutional structure.1\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of [a]\nsevere constitutional problem\u201d with an executive entity \u201cis [a]\nlack of historical precedent\u201d to support it.Id.,at 505\n(internal quotation marks omitted). An agency with a structure like\nthat of the CFPB is almost wholly unprecedented.After years of litigating the agency\u2019s\nconstitutionality, the Courts of Appeals, parties, andamicihave identified \u201conly a handful of isolated\u201d incidents in which\nCongress has provided good-cause tenure to principal officers who\nwield power alone rather than as members of a board or commission.Ibid.\u201c[T]hese few scattered examples\u201d\u2014four to be exact\u2014shed\nlittle light.NLRBv.Noel Canning,573 U.S.\n513, 538 (2014).First, the CFPB\u2019s defenders point to the\nComptroller of the Currency, who enjoyed removal protection forone yearduring the Civil War. That example has rightly been\ndismissed as an aberration. It was \u201cadopted without discussion\u201d\nduring the heat of the Civil War and abandoned before it could be\n\u201ctested by executive or judicial inquiry.\u201dMyers, 272\nU.\u00a0S., at 165. (At the time, the Comptroller may also have\nbeen an inferior officer, given that he labored \u201cunder the general\ndirection of the Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d Ch. 58, 12Stat.\n665.)[5]Second, the supporters of the CFPB point to the\nOffice of the Special Counsel (OSC), which has been headed by a\nsingle officer since 1978.[6]\nBut this first enduring single-leader office, created nearly 200\nyears after the Constitution was ratified, drew a contemporaneous\nconstitutional objection from the Office of Legal Counsel under\nPresident Carter and a subsequent veto on constitutional grounds by\nPresident Reagan. See Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel,\nCivil Service Commission, 2 Op. OLC 120, 122 (1978); Public Papers\nof the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp.\n1391\u20131392 (1991).[7] In any\nevent, the OSC exercises only limited jurisdiction to enforce\ncertain rules governing Federal Government employers and employees.\nSee 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71212. It does not bind private parties at\nall or wield regulatory authority comparable to the CFPB.Third, the CFPB\u2019s defenders note that the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) has been run by a single\nAdministrator since 1994. That example, too, is comparatively\nrecent and controversial. President Clinton questioned the\nconstitutionality of the SSA\u2019s new single-Director structure upon\nsigning it into law. See Public Papers of the Presidents, William\nJ. Clinton, Vol. II, Aug. 15, 1994, pp. 1471\u20131472 (1995) (inviting\na \u201ccorrective amendment\u201d from Congress). In addition, unlike the\nCFPB, the SSA lacks the authority to bring enforcement actions\nagainst private parties. Its role is largely limited to\nadjudicating claims for Social Security benefits.The only remaining example is the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), created in 2008 to assume\nresponsibility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That agency is\nessentially a companion of the CFPB, established in response to the\nsame financial crisis. See Housing and Economic Recovery Act of\n2008, 122Stat. 2654. It regulates primarily Government-sponsored\nenterprises, not purely private actors. And its single-Director\nstructure is a source of ongoing controversy. Indeed, it was\nrecently held unconstitutional by the Fifth Circuit, sitting en\nbanc. SeeCollinsv.Mnuchin, 938 F.3d 553, 587\u2013588\n(2019).With the exception of the one-year blip for the\nComptroller of the Currency, these isolated examples are modern and\ncontested. And they do not involve regulatory or enforcement\nauthority remotely comparable to that exercised by the CFPB. The\nCFPB\u2019s single-Director structure is an innovation with no foothold\nin history or tradition.[8]2In addition to being a historical anomaly, the\nCFPB\u2019s single-Director configuration is incompatible with our\nconstitutional structure. Aside from the sole exception of the\nPresidency, that structure scrupulously avoids concentrating power\nin the hands of any single individual.\u201cThe Framers recognized that, in the long term,\nstructural protections against abuse of power were critical to\npreserving liberty.\u201dBowsher, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 730. Their\nsolution to governmental power and its perils was simple: divide\nit. To prevent the \u201cgradual concentration\u201d of power in the same\nhands, they enabled \u201c[a]mbition .\u00a0.\u00a0. to counteract\nambition\u201d at every turn. The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke\ned. 1961) (J. Madison). At the highest level, they \u201csplit the atom\nof sovereignty\u201d itself into one Federal Government and the States.Gamblev.United States, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted). They\nthen divided the \u201cpowers of the new Federal Government into three\ndefined categories, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.\u201dChadha, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 951.They did not stop there. Most prominently, the\nFramers bifurcated the federal legislative power into two Chambers:\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate, each composed of\nmultiple Members and Senators. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a72, 3.The Executive Branch is a stark departure from\nall this division. The Framers viewed the legislative power as a\nspecial threat to individual liberty, so they divided that power to\nensure that \u201cdifferences of opinion\u201d and the \u201cjarrings of parties\u201d\nwould \u201cpromote deliberation and circumspection\u201d and \u201ccheck excesses\nin the majority.\u201d See The Federalist No. 70, at 475 (A. Hamilton);\nsee alsoid., No. 51, at 350. By contrast, the Framers\nthought it necessary to secure the authority of the Executive so\nthat he could carry out his unique responsibilities. Seeid., No. 70, at 475\u2013478. As Madison put it, while \u201cthe\nweight of the legislative authority requires that it should be\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. divided, the weakness of the executive may require,\non the other hand, that it should be fortified.\u201dId., No.\n51, at 350.The Framers deemed an energetic executive\nessential to \u201cthe protection of the community against foreign\nattacks,\u201d \u201cthe steady administration of the laws,\u201d \u201cthe protection\nof property,\u201d and \u201cthe security of liberty.\u201dId., No. 70, at\n471. Accordingly, they chose not to bog the Executive down with the\n\u201chabitual feebleness and dilatoriness\u201d that comes with a \u201cdiversity\nof views and opinions.\u201dId., at 476. Instead, they gave the\nExecutive the \u201c[d]ecision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch\u201d that\n\u201ccharacterise the proceedings of one man.\u201dId., at 472.To justify and checkthatauthority\u2014unique in our constitutional structure\u2014the Framers made\nthe President the most democratic and politically accountable\nofficial in Government. Only the President (along with the Vice\nPresident) is elected by the entire Nation. And the President\u2019s\npolitical accountability is enhanced by the solitary nature of the\nExecutive Branch, which provides \u201ca single object for the jealousy\nand watchfulness of the people.\u201dId.,at 479. The President\n\u201ccannot delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obligation\nto supervise that goes with it,\u201d because Article II \u201cmakes a single\nPresident responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\u201dFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 496\u2013497 (quotingClintonv.Jones,520 U.S.\n681, 712\u2013713 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment)).The resulting constitutional strategy is\nstraightforward: divide power everywhere except for the Presidency,\nand render the President directly accountable to the people through\nregular elections. In that scheme, individual executive officials\nwill still wield significant authority, but that authority remains\nsubject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected\nPresident. Through the President\u2019s oversight, \u201cthe chain of\ndependence [is] preserved,\u201d so that \u201cthe lowest officers, the\nmiddle grade, and the highest\u201d all \u201cdepend, as they ought, on the\nPresident, and the President on the community.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong.\n499 (J. Madison).The CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure contravenes\nthis carefully calibrated system by vesting significant\ngovernmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable\nto no one. The Director is neither elected by the people nor\nmeaningfully controlled (through the threat of removal) by someone\nwho is. The Director does not even depend on Congress for annual\nappropriations. See The Federalist No. 58, at 394 (J. Madison)\n(describing the \u201cpower over the purse\u201d as the \u201cmost compleat and\neffectual weapon\u201d in representing the interests of the people). Yet\nthe Director mayunilaterally, without meaningful\nsupervision, issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set\nenforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what\npenalties to impose on private parties. With no colleagues to\npersuade, and no boss or electorate looking over her shoulder, the\nDirector may dictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the\neconomy affecting millions of Americans.The CFPB Director\u2019s insulation from removal by\nan accountable President is enough to render the agency\u2019s structure\nunconstitutional. But several other features of the CFPB combine to\nmake the Director\u2019s removal protection even more problematic. In\naddition to lacking the most direct method of presidential\ncontrol\u2014removal at will\u2014the agency\u2019s unique structure also\nforecloses certain indirect methods of Presidential control.Because the CFPB is headed by a single Director\nwith a five-year term, some Presidents may not have any opportunity\nto shape its leadership and thereby influence its activities. A\nPresident elected in 2020 would likely not appoint a CFPB Director\nuntil 2023, and a President elected in 2028 mayneverappoint one. That means an unlucky President might get elected on a\nconsumer-protection platform and enter office only to find herself\nsaddled with a holdover Director from a competing political party\nwho is dead setagainstthat agenda. To make matters worse,\nthe agency\u2019s single-Director structure means the President will not\nhave the opportunity to appoint any other leaders\u2014such as a chair\nor fellow members of a Commission or Board\u2014who can serve as a check\non the Director\u2019s authority and help bring the agency in line with\nthe President\u2019s preferred policies.The CFPB\u2019s receipt of funds outside the\nappropriations process further aggravates the agency\u2019s threat to\nPresidential control. The President normally has the opportunity to\nrecommend or veto spending bills that affect the operation of\nadministrative agencies. See Art. I, \u00a77, cl. 2; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a73.\nAnd, for the past century, the President has annually submitted a\nproposed budget to Congress for approval. See Budget and Accounting\nAct, 1921, ch. 18, \u00a7201, 42Stat. 20. Presidents frequently use\nthese budgetary tools \u201cto influence the policies of independent\nagencies.\u201dPHH, 881 F.\u00a03d, at 147 (Henderson, J.,\ndissenting) (citing Pasachoff, The President\u2019s Budget as a Source\nof Agency Policy Control, 125 Yale L.\u00a0J. 2182, 2191, 2203\u20132204\n(2016)). But no similar opportunity exists for the President to\ninfluence the CFPB Director. Instead, the Director receives over\n$500 million per year to fund the agency\u2019s chosen priorities. And\nthe Director receives that money from the Federal Reserve, which is\nitself funded outside of the annual appropriations process. This\nfinancial freedom makes it even more likely that the agency will\n\u201cslip from the Executive\u2019s control, and thus from that of the\npeople.\u201dFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at\n499.[9]3Amicusraises three principal arguments\nin the agency\u2019s defense. At the outset,amicusquestions the\ntextual basis for the removal power and highlights statements from\nMadison, Hamilton, and Chief Justice Marshall expressing\n\u201cheterodox\u201d views on the subject. Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae4\u20135, 28\u201329. But those concerns are misplaced.\nIt is true that \u201cthere is no \u2018removal clause\u2019 in the Constitution,\u201did., at 1, but neither is there a \u201cseparation of powers\nclause\u201d or a \u201cfederalism clause.\u201d These foundational doctrines are\ninstead evident from the Constitution\u2019s vesting of certain powers\nin certain bodies. As we have explained many times before, the\nPresident\u2019s removal power stems from Article II\u2019s vesting of the\n\u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President.Free Enterprise Fund,\n561 U. S., at 483 (quoting Art. II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a01). As for the\nopinions of Madison, Hamilton, and Chief Justice Marshall, we have\nalready considered the statements cited byamicusand\ndiscounted them in light of their context (Madison), the fact they\nreflect initial impressions later abandoned by the speaker\n(Hamilton), or their subsequent rejection as ill-considered dicta\n(Chief Justice Marshall). SeeFree Enterprise Fund, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 500, n. 6 (Madison);Myers, 272 U. S., at\n136\u2013139, 142\u2013144 (Hamilton and Chief Justice Marshall).[10]Next,amicusoffers a grand theory of\nour removal precedents that, if accepted, could leave room for an\nagency like the CFPB\u2014and many other innovative intrusions on\nArticle II. According toamicus,Humphrey\u2019s ExecutorandMorrisonestablish a general rule that Congress may\nimpose \u201cmodest\u201d restrictions on the President\u2019s removal power, with\nonly two limited exceptions. Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus\nCuriae33\u201337. Congress may not reserve a roleforitselfin individual removal decisions (as it attempted to\ndo inMyersandBowsher).And it may not\neliminate the President\u2019s removal power altogether (as it\neffectively did inFree EnterpriseFund).Outside those two situations,amicusargues, Congress is\ngenerally free to constrain the President\u2019s removal power. See alsopost, at 16\u201322 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment with\nrespect to severability and dissenting in part) (hereinafter\ndissent) (expressing similar view).But text, first principles, the First Congress\u2019s\ndecision in 1789,Myers, andFree Enterprise Fundall\nestablish that the President\u2019s removal power is the rule, not the\nexception. While we do not revisitHumphrey\u2019s Executoror\nany other precedent today, we decline to elevate it into a\nfreestanding invitation for Congress to impose additional\nrestrictions on the President\u2019s removal authority.[11]Finally,amicuscontends that if we\nidentify a constitutional problem with the CFPB\u2019s structure, we\nshould avoid it by broadly construing the statutory grounds for\nremoving the CFPB Director from office. See Brief for\nCourt-AppointedAmicus Curiae50\u201353; Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\u201362.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Director may be removed for\n\u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75491(c)(3). Inamicus\u2019 view, that\nlanguage could be interpreted to reserve substantial discretion to\nthe President. Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae51.We are not persuaded. For one,Humphrey\u2019s\nExecutorimplicitly rejected an interpretation that would leave\nthe President free to remove an officer based on disagreements\nabout agency policy. See 295 U.\u00a0S., at 619, 625\u2013626. In\naddition, while bothamicusand the House of Representatives\ninvite us to adopt whatever construction would cure the\nconstitutional problem, they have not advanced any workable\nstandard derived from the statutory language.Amicussuggests that the proper standard might permit removals based ongeneralpolicy disagreements, but notspecificones;\nthe House suggests that the permissible bases for removal might\nvary depending on the context and the Presidential power involved.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\u201360, 76\u201377. They do not attempt to root\neither of those standards in the statutory text. Further, although\nnearly identical language governs the removal of some two-dozen\nmultimember independent agencies,amicussuggests that the\nstandard should vary from agency to agency, morphing as necessary\nto avoid constitutional doubt. Tr. of Oral Arg. 55\u201356. We decline\nto embrace such an uncertain and elastic approach to the text.Amicusand the House also fail to engage\nwith the Dodd-Frank Act as a whole, which makes plain that the CFPB\nis an \u201cindependent bureau.\u201d 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75491(a); see\nalso 44 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73502(5) (listing the CFPB as an\n\u201cindependent regulatory agency\u201d). Neitheramicusnor the\nHouse explains how the CFPB would be \u201cindependent\u201d if its head were\nrequired to implement the President\u2019s policies upon pain of\nremoval. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 838 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n\u201cindependent\u201d as \u201c[n]ot subject to the control or influence of\nanother\u201d). The Constitution might of course compel the agency to be\ndependent on the President notwithstanding Congress\u2019s contrary\nintent, but that result cannot fairly be inferred from the statute\nCongress enacted.Constitutional avoidance is not a license to\nrewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the Constitution needs it\nto say in a given situation. Without a proffered interpretation\nthat is rooted in the statutory text and structure, and would avoid\nthe constitutional violation we have identified, we take Congress\nat its word that it meant to impose a meaningful restriction on the\nPresident\u2019s removal authority.The dissent, for its part, largely reprises\npoints that the Court has already considered and rejected: It notes\nthe lack of an express removal provision, invokes Congress\u2019s\ngeneral power to create and define executive offices, highlights\nisolated statements from individual Framers, downplays the decision\nof 1789, minimizesMyers, brainstorms methods of\nPresidential control short of removal, touts the need for creative\ncongressional responses to technological and economic change, and\ncelebrates a pragmatic, flexible approach to American governance.\nSeepost, at 1\u201325, 32\u201333, 38.If these arguments sound familiar, it\u2019s because\nthey are. They were raised by the dissent inFree Enterprise\nFund. Comparepost, at 1\u201325, 32\u201333, 38, withFree\nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 515\u2013524, 530 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). The answers to these repeated concerns (beyond those\nwe have already covered) are the same today as they were ten years\nago. Today, as then, Congress\u2019s \u201cplenary control over the salary,\nduties, and even existence of executive offices\u201d makes\n\u201cPresidential oversight\u201dmorecritical\u2014not less\u2014as the\n\u201c[o]nly\u201d tool to \u201ccounter [Congress\u2019s] influence.\u201dId., at\n500 (opinion of the Court). Today, as then, the various\n\u201cbureaucratic minutiae\u201d a President might use to corral agency\npersonnel is no substitute for at will removal.Ibid.And\ntoday, as always, the urge to meet new technological and societal\nproblems with novel governmental structures must be tempered by\nconstitutional restraints that are not known\u2014and were not\nchosen\u2014for their efficiency or flexibility.Id.,at 499.As we explained inFree Enterprise Fund,\n\u201cOne can have a government that functions without being ruled by\nfunctionaries, and a government that benefits from expertise\nwithout being ruled by experts.\u201dIbid.While \u201c[n]o one\ndoubts Congress\u2019s power to create a vast and varied federal\nbureaucracy,\u201d the expansion of that bureaucracy into new\nterritories the Framers could scarcely have imagined only sharpens\nour duty to ensure that the Executive Branch is overseen by a\nPresident accountable to the people.Ibid.IVHaving concluded that the CFPB\u2019s leadership by\na single independent Director violates the separation of powers, we\nnow turn to the appropriate remedy. We directed the parties to\nbrief and argue whether the Director\u2019s removal protection was\nseverable from the other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that\nestablish the CFPB. If so, then the CFPB may continue to exist and\noperate notwithstanding Congress\u2019s unconstitutional attempt to\ninsulate the agency\u2019s Director from removal by the President. There\nis a live controversy between the parties on that question, and\nresolving it is a necessary step in determining petitioner\u2019s\nentitlement to its requested relief.As the defendant in this action, petitioner\nseeks a straightforward remedy. It asks us to deny the Government\u2019s\npetition to enforce the civil investigative demand and dismiss the\ncase. The Government counters that the demand, though initially\nissued by a Director unconstitutionally insulated from removal, can\nstill be enforced on remand because it has since been ratified by\nan Acting Director accountable to the President. The parties\ndispute whether this alleged ratification in fact occurred and\nwhether, if so, it is legally sufficient to cure the constitutional\ndefect in the original demand. That debate turns on case-specific\nfactual and legal questions not addressed below and not briefed\nhere. A remand for the lower Courts to consider those questions in\nthe first instance is therefore the appropriate course\u2014unless such\na remand would be futile.In petitioner\u2019s view, it would be. Before the\nCourt of Appeals, petitioner contended that, regardless of any\nratification, the demand is unenforceable because the statutory\nprovision insulating the CFPB Director from removal cannot be\nsevered from the other statutory provisions that define the CFPB\u2019s\nauthority. See Brief for Appellant in No. 17\u201356324 (CA9), pp.\n27\u201328, 30\u201332. If petitioner is correct, and the offending removal\nprovision means the entire agency is unconstitutional and powerless\nto act, then a remand would be pointless. With no agency left with\nstatutory authority to maintain this suit or otherwise enforce the\ndemand, the appropriate disposition would be to reverse with\ninstructions to deny the Government\u2019s petition to enforce the\nagency\u2019s demand for documents and dismiss the case, as petitioner\nrequests.Accordingly, there is a live controversy over\nthe question of severability. And that controversy is essential to\nour ability to provide petitioner the relief it seeks: If the\nremoval restriction is not severable, then we must grant the relief\nrequested, promptly rejecting the demand outright. If, on the other\nhand, the removal restriction is severable, we must instead remand\nfor the Government to press its ratification arguments in further\nproceedings. Unlike the lingering ratification issue, severability\npresents a pure question of law that has been fully briefed and\nargued by the parties. We therefore proceed to address it.[12]It has long been settled that \u201cone section of a\nstatute may be repugnant to the Constitution without rendering the\nwhole act void.\u201dLoebv.Columbia Township Trustees,179 U.S.\n472, 490 (1900) (quotingTreasurer ofFayette\nCty.v.People\u2019s & Drovers\u2019 Bank, 47 Ohio St. 503,\n523, 25 N.E. 697, 702 (1890)). Because a \u201cstatute bad in part is\nnot necessarily void in its entirety,\u201d \u201c[p]rovisions within the\nlegislative power may stand if separable from the bad.\u201dDorchyv.Kansas,264 U.S.\n286, 289\u2013290 (1924).\u201cGenerally speaking, when confronting a\nconstitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to\nthe problem, severing any problematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.\u201dFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at\n508 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even in the absence of a\nseverability clause, the \u201ctraditional\u201d rule is that \u201cthe\nunconstitutional provision must be severed unless the statute\ncreated in its absence is legislation that Congress would not have\nenacted.\u201dAlaska Airlines, Inc.v.Brock,480 U.S.\n678, 685 (1987). When Congress has expressly provided a\nseverability clause, our task is simplified. We will presume \u201cthat\nCongress did not intend the validity of the statute in question to\ndepend on the validity of the constitutionally offensive provision\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. unless there is strong evidence that Congress\nintended otherwise.\u201dId.,at 686.The only constitutional defect we have\nidentified in the CFPB\u2019s structure is the Director\u2019s insulation\nfrom removal. If the Director were removable at will by the\nPresident, the constitutional violation would disappear. We must\ntherefore decide whether the removal provision can be severed from\nthe other statutory provisions relating to the CFPB\u2019s powers and\nresponsibilities.InFree Enterprise Fund, we found a set\nof unconstitutional removal provisions severable even in the\nabsence of an express severability clause because the surviving\nprovisions were capable of \u201cfunctioning independently\u201d and \u201cnothing\nin the statute\u2019s text or historical context [made] it evident that\nCongress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution,\nwould have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are\nremovable at will.\u201d 561 U.\u00a0S., at 509 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).So too here. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nAct bearing on the CFPB\u2019s structure and duties remain fully\noperative without the offending tenure restriction. Those\nprovisions are capable of functioning independently, and there is\nnothing in the text or history of the Dodd-Frank Act that\ndemonstrates Congress would have preferrednoCFPB to a CFPB\nsupervised by the President. Quite the opposite. Unlike the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act at issue inFree Enterprise Fund, the\nDodd-Frank Act contains an express severability clause. There is no\nneed to wonder what Congress would have wanted if \u201cany provision of\nthis Act\u201d is \u201cheld to be unconstitutional\u201d because it has told us:\n\u201cthe remainder of this Act\u201d should \u201cnot be affected.\u201d 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75302.Petitioner urges us to disregard this plain\nlanguage for three reasons. None is persuasive. First, petitioner\ndismisses the clause as non-probative \u201cboilerplate\u201d because it\napplies \u201cto the entire, 848-page Dodd-Frank Act\u201d and \u201cappears\nalmost 600 pages before the removal provision at issue.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 45. In petitioner\u2019s view, that means we cannot be\ncertain that Congress really meant to apply the clause to each of\nthe Act\u2019s provisions. But boilerplate is boilerplate for a\nreason\u2014because it offers tried-and-true language to ensure a\nprecise and predictable result. That is the case here. The language\nunmistakably references \u201canyprovision of this Act.\u201d 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75302 (emphasis added). And it appears in a\nlogical and prominent place, immediately following the Act\u2019s title\nand definitions sections, reinforcing the conclusion that it\napplies to the entirety of the Act. Congress was not required to\nlaboriously insert duplicative severability clauses, provision by\nprovision, to accomplish its stated objective.Second, petitioner points to an additional\nseverability clause in the Act that applies only to one of the\nAct\u2019s subtitles. See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78232. In petitioner\u2019s\nview, that clause would be superfluous if Congress meant the\ngeneral severability clause to apply across the Act. But \u201cour\npreference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.\u201dLamiev.United States Trustee,540 U.S.\n526, 536 (2004). In this instance, the redundant language\nappears to reflect the fact that the subtitle to which it refers\noriginated as a standalone bill that was later incorporated into\nDodd-Frank. Compare 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78232 with H.\u00a0R.\n2571, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7302 (2009). And petitioner does not\noffer any construction that would give effect to both provisions,\nmaking the redundancy both inescapable and unilluminating. SeeMicrosoft Corp.v.i4i L. P.,564 U.S.\n91, 106 (2011) (\u201cThe canon against superfluity assists only\nwhere a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).Finally, petitioner argues more broadly that\nCongress would not have wanted to give the President unbridled\ncontrol over the CFPB\u2019s vast authority. Petitioner highlights the\nreferences to the CFPB\u2019s independence in the statutory text and\nlegislative history, as well as in Professor Warren\u2019s and the Obama\nadministration\u2019s original proposals. See Brief for Petitioner 43\u201344\n(collecting examples). And petitioner submits that Congress might\nnot have exempted the CFPB from congressional oversight via the\nappropriations process if it had known that the CFPB would come\nunder executive control.These observations certainly confirm that\nCongress preferred an independent CFPB to a dependent one; but they\nshed little light on the critical question whether Congress would\nhave preferred a dependent CFPB tono agency at all.That is\nthe only question we have the authority to decide, and the answer\nseems clear. Petitioner assumes that, if we eliminate the CFPB,\nregulatory and enforcement authority over the statutes it\nadministers would simply revert back to the handful of independent\nagencies previously responsible for them. Seeid., at 46.\nBut, as the Solicitor General and House of Representatives explain,\nthat shift would trigger a major regulatory disruption and would\nleave appreciable damage to Congress\u2019s work in the consumer-finance\narena. See Reply Brief for Respondent 21\u201322; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n67\u201368. One of the agencies whose regulatory authority was\ntransferred to the CFPB no longer exists. See 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a75412\u20135413 (Office of Thrift Supervision). The others do not have\nthe staff or appropriations to absorb the CFPB\u2019s 1,500-employee,\n500-million-dollar operations. And none has the authority to\nadminister the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s new prohibition on unfair and\ndeceptive practices in the consumer-finance sector. Given these\nconsequences, it is far from evident that Congress would have\npreferred no CFPB to a CFPB led by a Director removable at will by\nthe President.Justice Thomas would have us junk our settled\nseverability doctrine and start afresh, even though no party has\nasked us to do so. Seepost, at 15\u201316, 21\u201324 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Among other things, he\nobjects that it is sheer \u201cspeculation\u201d that Congress would prefer\nthat its consumer protection laws be enforced by a Director\naccountable to the President rather than not at all.Post,\nat 23\u201324. We think it clear that Congress would prefer that we use\na scalpel rather than a bulldozer in curing the constitutional\ndefect we identify today. And such an approach by this Court can\ncome as no surprise to Congress, which was on notice of\nconstitutional objections to single-Director agencies by multiple\npast Presidents from both political parties,supra, at\n19\u201320, and enacted Dodd-Frank against the background of our\nestablished severability doctrine.As in every severability case, there may be\nmeans of remedying the defect in the CFPB\u2019s structure that the\nCourt lacks the authority to provide. Our severability analysis\ndoes not foreclose Congress from pursuing alternative responses to\nthe problem\u2014for example, converting the CFPB into a multimember\nagency. The Court\u2019s only instrument, however, is a blunt one. We\nhave \u201cthe negative power to disregard an unconstitutional\nenactment,\u201dMassachusettsv.Mellon,262 U.S.\n447, 488 (1923); seeMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 178 (1803), but we cannot re-write Congress\u2019s work by creating\noffices, terms, and the like. \u201c[S]uch editorial freedom\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.\u201dFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 510.Because we find the Director\u2019s removal\nprotection severable from the other provisions of Dodd-Frank that\nestablish the CFPB, we remand for the Court of Appeals to consider\nwhether the civil investigative demand was validly ratified.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*A decade ago, we declined to extend Congress\u2019s\nauthority to limit the President\u2019s removal power to a new\nsituation, never before confronted by the Court. We do the same\ntoday. In our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to\nthe President, and that power generally includes the ability to\nsupervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his\nstead. While we have previously upheld limits on the President\u2019s\nremoval authority in certain contexts, we decline to do so when it\ncomes to principal officers who, acting alone, wield significant\nexecutive power. The Constitution requires that such officials\nremain dependent on the President, who in turn is accountable to\nthe people.The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Director Kraninger did\nnot indicate whether she would disregard her statutory removal\nprotection if the President attempted to remove her without\ncause.2The Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the FTC did not exercise executive power has not withstood the\ntest of time. As we observed inMorrisonv.Olson,487 U.S.\n654(1988), \u201c[I]t is hard to dispute that the powers of the FTC\nat the time ofHumphrey\u2019s Executorwould at the present time\nbe considered \u2018executive,\u2019 at least to some degree.\u201dId.,at\n690, n. 28. See alsoArlingtonv.FCC,569 U.S.\n290, 305, n.\u00a04 (2013) (even though the activities of\nadministrative agencies \u201ctake \u2018legislative\u2019 and \u2018judicial\u2019 forms,\u201d\n\u201cthey are exercises of\u2014indeed, under our constitutional structure\ntheymust beexercises of\u2014the \u2018executive Power\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nArt.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.\u00a01)).3Article II distinguishes\nbetween two kinds of officers\u2014principal officers (who must be\nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the\nSenate) and inferior officers (whose appointment Congress may vest\nin the President, courts, or heads of Departments). \u00a72, cl. 2.\nWhile \u201c[o]ur cases have not set forth an exclusive criterion for\ndistinguishing between principal and inferior officers,\u201d we have in\nthe past examined factors such as the nature, scope, and duration\nof an officer\u2019s duties.Edmondv.United States,520 U.S.\n651, 661 (1997). More recently, we have focused on whether the\nofficer\u2019s work is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal officer.Id.,at 663.4The dissent would have us\nignore the reasoning ofHumphrey\u2019s Executorand instead\napply the decision only as part of a reimaginedHumphrey\u2019s-through-Morrisonframework. Seepost, at 18, n.\u00a07, 19\u201322 (Kagan, J., concurring in\njudgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part)\n(hereinafter dissent). But we take the decision on its own terms,\nnot through gloss added by a later Court in dicta. The dissent also\ncriticizes us for suggesting that the 1935 FTC may have had lesser\nresponsibilities than the present FTC. Seepost, at 27,\nn.\u00a010. Perhaps the FTC possessed broader rulemaking,\nenforcement, and adjudicatory powers than theHumphrey\u2019sCourt appreciated. Perhaps not. Either way, what matters is the set\nof powers the Court considered as the basis for its decision, not\nany latent powers that the agency may have had not alluded to by\nthe Court.5The dissent suggests that\nthe Comptroller still enjoyed some degree of insulation after his\nremoval protection was repealed because the President faced a new\nrequirement to \u201ccommunicate[\u00a0]\u201d his \u201creasons\u201d for terminating\nthe Comptroller to the Senate.Post,at 15 (quoting Act of\nJune 3, 1864, ch. 106, \u00a71, 13Stat. 100). But the President could\nstill remove the Comptroller for any reason so long as the\nPresident was, in the dissent\u2019s phrase, \u201cin a firing mood.\u201dPost, at 15.6The OSC should not be\nconfused with the independent counsel inMorrisonor the\nspecial counsel recently appointed to investigate allegations\nrelated to the 2016 Presidential election. Despite sharing similar\ntitles, those individuals have no relationship to the\nOSC.7An Act similar to the one\nvetoed by President Reagan was eventually signed by President\nGeorge H. W. Bush after extensive negotiations and compromises with\nCongress. See Public Papers of the Presidents, George H. W. Bush,\nVol. I, Apr. 10, 1989, p. 391 (1990).8The dissent categorizes\nthe CFPB as one of many \u201cfinancial regulators\u201d that have\nhistorically enjoyed some insulation from the President. Seepost, at 11\u201316. But even assuming financial institutions\nlike the Second Bank and the Federal Reserve can claim a special\nhistorical status, the CFPB is in an entirely different league. It\nacts as a mini legislature, prosecutor, and court, responsible for\ncreating substantive rules for a wide swath of industries,\nprosecuting violations, and levying knee-buckling penalties against\nprivate citizens. Seesupra,at 4\u20135. And, of course, it is\nthe only agency of its kind run by a single Director.9Amicusand the\ndissent try to diminish the CFPB\u2019s insulation from Presidential\ncontrol by observing that the CFPB\u2019s final rules can be set aside\nby a super majority of the Financial Stability and Oversight\nCouncil (FSOC). See Brief for Court-AppointedAmicus Curiae40;post, at 33, n.\u00a013, 36. But the FSOC\u2019s veto power\nis statutorily reserved for extreme situations, when two-thirds of\nthe Council concludes that a CFPB regulation would \u201cput the safety\nand soundness of the United States banking system or the stability\nof the financial system of the United States at risk.\u201d 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a75513(a), (c)(3). That narrow escape hatch has\nno impact on the CFPB\u2019s enforcement or adjudicatory authority and\nhas never been used in the ten years since the agency\u2019s creation.\nIt certainlydoes not render the CFPB\u2019s independent, single-Director\nstructureconstitutional.10The\ndissent likewise points to Madison\u2019s statement in The Federalist\nNo. 39 that the \u201ctenure\u201d of \u201cministerial offices generally will be\na subject of legal regulation.\u201dPost, at 10 (quoting The\nFederalist No. 39, p. 253 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)). But whatever\nMadison may have meant by that statement, he later led the charge\nin contending, on the floor of the First Congress, that \u201cinasmuch\nas the power of removal is of an Executive nature .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nit is beyond the reach of the Legislative body.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong.\n464 (1789); see alsoid., at 462\u2013464, 495\u2013496. Like the\ndissent inFree Enterprise Fund, the dissent goes on to\n\u201cattribute[\u00a0] to Madison a belief that .\u00a0.\u00a0. the\nComptroller[\u00a0] could be made independent of the President. But\nMadison\u2019s actual proposal, consistent with his view of the\nConstitution, was that the Comptroller hold office for a term of\n\u2018years, unless sooner removed by the President\u2019; he would thus be\n\u2018dependent upon the President, because he can be removed by him,\u2019\nand also \u2018dependent upon the Senate, because they must consent to\nhis [reappointment] for every term of years.\u2019 \u201dFree Enterprise\nFundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477, 499, 500 n. 6 (2010) (citation omitted) (quoting 1 Annals\nof Cong. 612). Seepost, at 10, n.\u00a04. The dissent\nfurther notes that, at the time of the founding, some States placed\nlimitations on their Governors\u2019 removal power. Seepost, at\n7. But the Framers hardly viewed State Governors as a reliable\nguide in fashioning the Federal Executive. Indeed, they expressly\nrejected the \u201cexecutive council\u201d structure favored by most States,\nfearing that subjecting the President to oversight, as the States\nhad, would \u201cdistract and .\u00a0.\u00a0. enervate the whole system\nof administration\u201d and inject it with \u201chabitual feebleness and\ndilatoriness.\u201d The Federalist No. 70, at 473, 476 (A.\nHamilton).11Building onamicus\u2019 proposal,\nthe dissent would endorse whatever \u201cthe times demand, so long as\nthe President retains the ability to carry out his constitutional\nfunctions.\u201dPost, at 4. But that amorphous test provides no\nreal limiting principle. The \u201cclearest\u201d (and only) \u201cexample\u201d the\ndissent can muster for what may be prohibited is a for-cause\nremoval restriction placed on the President\u2019s \u201cclose military or\ndiplomatic advisers.\u201dPost, at 17. But that carveout makes\nno logical or constitutional sense. In the dissent\u2019s view,\nfor-cause removal restrictions are permissible because they\nguarantee the President \u201cmeaningful control\u201d over his subordinates.Post, at 28 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted); see alsopost, at 8, 20, 26, 36.If that is\nthe theory, then what is the harm in giving the President the same\n\u201cmeaningful control\u201d over his close advisers? The dissent claims to\nsee a constitutional distinction between the President\u2019s \u201cown\nconstitutional duties in foreign relations and war\u201d and his duty to\nexecute laws passed by Congress.Post, at 13. But the same\nArticle that establishes the President\u2019s foreign relations and war\nduties expressly entrusts him to take care that the laws be\nfaithfully executed. And, from the perspective of the governed, it\nis far from clear that the President\u2019s core and traditional powers\npresent greater cause for concern than peripheral and modern ones.\nIf anything, \u201c[t]he growth of the Executive Branch, which now\nwields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life,heightensthe concern that it may slip from the Executive\u2019s\ncontrol, and thus from that of the people.\u201dFree Enterprise\nFund, 561 U. S., at 499 (emphasis added).12Justice Thomas believes that any\nratification is irrelevant. In his view, even if the issuance of\nthe demand and initiation of this suit have been validly ratified,\nDirector Kraninger\u2019s activities in litigating the case\u2014after\ninheriting it from an Acting Director, but before becoming\nremovable at will herself in light of our decision\u2014present a\ndistinct constitutional injury requiring immediate dismissal.
