It makes it a felony for a registered sex\noffender simply to visit a vast array of websites, including many\nthat appear to provide no realistic opportunity for communications\nthat could facilitate the abuse of children. Because of the law\u2019s\nextraordinary breadth, I agree with the Court that it violates the\nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment.I cannot join the opinion of the Court, however,\nbecause of its undisciplined dicta. The Court is unable to resist\nmusings that seem to equate the entirety of the internet with\npublic streets and parks.Ante, at 4\u20135. And this language is\nbound to be interpreted by some to mean that the States are largely\npowerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from\nvisiting any internet sites, including, for example, teenage dating\nsites and sites designed to permit minors to discuss personal\nproblems with their peers. I am troubled by the implications of the\nCourt\u2019s unnecessary rhetoric.IAThe North Carolina law at issue makes it a\nfelony for a registered sex offender \u201cto access a commercial social\nnetworking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site\npermits minor children to become members or to create or maintain\npersonal Web pages.\u201d N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714\u2013202.5(a), (e)\n(2015). And as I will explain, the statutory definition of a\n\u201ccommercial social networking Web site\u201d is very broad.Packingham and the State debate the analytical\nframework that governs this case. The State argues that the law in\nquestion is content neutral and merely regulates a \u201cplace\u201d\n(i.e., the internet) where convicted sex offenders may wish\nto engage in speech. See Brief for Respondent 20\u201325. Therefore,\naccording to the State, the standard applicable to \u201ctime, place, or\nmanner\u201d restrictions should apply. SeeWardv.Rock\nAgainst Racism, 491 U.\u00a0S. 781, 791 (1989) . Packingham\nresponds that the challenged statute is \u201cunlike any law this Court\nhas considered as a time, place, or manner restriction,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 37, and he advocates a more demanding standard of\nreview,id., at 37\u201339.Like the Court, I find it unnecessary to resolve\nthis dispute because the law in question cannot satisfy the\nstandard applicable to a content-neutral regulation of the place\nwhere speech may occur.BA content-neutral \u201ctime, place, or manner\u201d\nrestriction must serve a \u201clegitimate\u201d government interest,Ward,supra, at 798, and the North Carolina law\neasily satisfies this requirement. As we have frequently noted,\n\u201c[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children\nconstitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201dFerber,supra, at 757. \u201cSex offenders are a serious\nthreat,\u201d and \u201cthe victims of sexual assault are most often\njuveniles.\u201dMcKunev.Lile, 536 U.\u00a0S. 24, 32\n(2002) (plurality opinion); seeConnecticut Dept. of Public\nSafetyv.Doe, 538 U.\u00a0S. 1, 4 (2003) . \u201c[T]he\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. interest [of] safeguarding the physical and\npsychological well-being of a minor .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a compelling\none,\u201dGlobe Newspaper Co.v.Superior Court, County of\nNorfolk, 457 U.\u00a0S. 596, 607 (1982) , and \u201cwe have\nsustained legislation aimed at protecting the physical and\nemotional well-being of youth even when the laws have operated in\nthe sensitive area of constitutionally protected rights,\u201dFerber,supra, at 757.Repeat sex offenders pose an especially grave\nrisk to children. \u201cWhen convicted sex offenders reenter society,\nthey are much more likely than any other type of offender to be\nrearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\u201dMcKune,supra, at 33 (plurality opinion); seeUnited Statesv.Kebodeaux, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2013) (slip\nop.,at 8\u20139).The State\u2019s interest in protecting children from\nrecidivist sex offenders plainly applies to internet use. Several\nfactors make the internet a powerful tool for the would-be child\nabuser. First, children often use the internet in a way that gives\noffenders easy access to their personal information\u2014by, for\nexample, communicating with strangers and allowing sites to\ndisclose their location.[1]\nSecond, the internet provides previously unavailable ways of\ncommunicating with, stalking, and ultimately abusing children. An\nabuser can create a false profile that misrepresents the abuser\u2019s\nage and gender. The abuser can lure the minor into engaging in\nsexual conversations, sending explicit photos, or even meeting in\nperson. And an abuser can use a child\u2019s location posts on the\ninternet to determine the pattern of the child\u2019s day-to-day\nactivities\u2014and even the child\u2019s location at a given moment. Such\nuses of the internet are already well documented, both in\nresearch[2] and in reported\ndecisions.[3]Because protecting children from abuse is a\ncompelling state interest and sex offenders can (and do) use the\ninternet to engage in such abuse, it is legitimate and entirely\nreasonable for States to try to stop abuse from occurring before it\nhappens.C1It is not enough, however, that the law before\nus is designed to serve a compelling state interest; it also must\nnot \u201cburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further\nthe government\u2019s legitimate interests.\u201dWard, 491\nU.\u00a0S., at 798\u2013799; see alsoMcCullenv.Coakley,\n573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2014) (slip op., at 18\u201319). The North\nCarolina law fails this requirement.A straightforward reading of the text of\nN.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a714\u2013202.5 compels the conclusion that it\nprohibits sex offenders from accessing an enormous number of\nwebsites. The law defines a \u201ccommercial social networking Web site\u201d\nas one with four characteristics. First, the website must be\n\u201coperated by a person who derives revenue from membership fees,\nadvertising, or other sources related to the operation of the Web\nsite.\u201d \u00a714\u2013202.5(b)(1). Due to the prevalence of advertising on\nwebsites of all types, this requirement does little to limit the\nstatute\u2019s reach.Second, the website must \u201c[f]acilitat[e] the\nsocial introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of\nfriendship, meeting other persons, or information exchanges.\u201d\n\u00a714\u2013202.5(b)(2). The term \u201csocial introduction\u201d easily encompasses\nany casual exchange, and the term \u201cinformation exchanges\u201d seems to\napply to any site that provides an opportunity for a visitor to\npost a statement or comment that may be read by other visitors.\nToday, a great many websites include this feature.Third, a website must \u201c[a]llo[w] users to create\nWeb pages or personal profiles that contain informationsuch\nasthe name or nickname of the user, photographs placed on the\npersonal Web page by the user, other personal information about the\nuser, and links to other personal Web pages on the commercial\nsocial networking Web site of friends or associates of the user\nthat may be accessed by other users or visitors to the Web site.\u201d\n\u00a714\u2013202.5(b)(3) (emphasis added). This definition covers websites\nthat allow users to create anything that can be called a \u201cpersonal\nprofile,\u201di.e., a short description of the user.[4] Con-trary to the argument of the\nState, Brief for Respondent 26\u201327, everything that follows the\nphrase \u201csuch as\u201d is an illustration of features that a covered\nwebsite or personal profile may (but need not) include.Fourth, in order to fit within the statute, a\nwebsite must \u201c[p]rovid[e] users or visitors .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmechanisms to communicate with other users,such asa\nmessage board, chat room, electronic mail, or instant messenger.\u201d\n\u00a714\u2013202.5(b)(4) (emphasis added). This requirement seems to demand\nno more than that a website allow back-and-forth comments between\nusers. And since a comment function is undoubtedly a \u201cmechanis[m]\nto communicate with other users,\u201dibid., it appears to\nfollow that any website with such a function satisfies this\nrequirement.2The fatal problem for \u00a714\u2013202.5 is that its\nwide sweep precludes access to a large number of websites that are\nmost unlikely to facilitate the commission of a sex crime against a\nchild. A handful of examples illustrates this point.Take, for example, the popular retail website\nAmazon.com, which allows minors to use its services[5] and meets all four requirements of\n\u00a714\u2013202.5\u2019s definition of a commercial social networking website.\nFirst, as a seller of products, Amazon unquestionably derives\nrevenue from the operation of its website. Second, the Amazon site\nfacilitates the social introduction of people for the purpose of\ninformation exchanges. When someone purchases a product on Amazon,\nthe purchaser can review the product and upload photographs, and\nother buyers can then respond to the review.[6] This information exchange about products that\nAmazon sells undoubtedly fits within the definition in \u00a714\u2013202.5.\nIt is the equivalent of passengers on a bus comparing notes about\nproducts they have purchased. Third, Amazon allows a user to create\na personal profile, which is then associated with the product\nreviews that the user uploads. Such a profile can contain an\nassortment of information, including the user\u2019s name, e-mail\naddress, and picture.[7] And\nfourth, given its back-and-forth comment function, Amazon satisfies\nthe final statutory requirement.[8]Many news websites are also covered by this\ndefinition. For example, the Washington Post\u2019s website gives minors\naccess[9] and satisfies the\nfour elements that define a commercial social networking website.\nThe website (1) derives revenue from ads and (2) facilitates social\nintroductions for the purpose of information exchanges. Users of\nthe site can comment on articles, reply to other users\u2019 comments,\nand recommend another user\u2019s comment.[10] Users can also (3) create personal profiles that\ninclude a name or nickname and a photograph. The photograph and\nname will then appear next to every comment the user leaves on an\narticle. Finally (4), the back-and-forth comment section is a\nmechanism for users to communicate among themselves. The site thus\nfalls within \u00a714\u2013202.5 and is accordingly off limits for registered\nsex offenders in NorthCarolina.Or consider WebMD\u2014a website that contains\nhealth-related resources, from tools that help users find a doctor\nto information on preventative care and the symptoms associated\nwith particular medical problems. WebMD, too, allows children on\nthe site.[11] And it\nexhibits the four hallmarks of a \u201ccommercial social networking\u201d\nwebsite. It obtains revenue from advertisements.[12] It facilitates information\nexchanges\u2014via message boards that allow users to engage in public\ndiscussion of an assortment of health issues.[13] It allows users to create basic profile\npages: Users can upload a picture and some basic information about\nthemselves, and other users can see their aggregated comments and\n\u201clikes.\u201d[14] WebMD also\nprovides message boards, which are specifically mentioned in the\nstatute as a \u201cmechanis[m] to communicate with other users.\u201d\nN.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a714\u2013202.5(b)(4).As these examples illustrate, the North Carolina\nlaw has a very broad reach and covers websites that are ill suited\nfor use in stalking or abusing children. The focus of the\ndiscussion on these sites\u2014shopping, news, health\u2014does not provide a\nconvenient jumping off point for conversations that may lead to\nabuse. In addition, the social exchanges facilitated by these\nwebsites occur in the open, and this reduces the possibility of a\nchild being secretly lured into an abusive situation. These\nwebsites also give sex offenders little opportunity to gather\npersonal details about a child; the information that can be listed\nin a profile is limited, and the profiles are brief. What is more,\nnone of these websites make it easy to determine a child\u2019s precise\nlocation at a given moment. For example, they do not permit photo\nstreams (at most, a child could upload a single profile\nphotograph), and they do not include up-to-the minute location\nservices. Such websites would provide essentially no aid to a\nwould-be child abuser.Placing this set of websites categorically off\nlimits from registered sex offenders prohibits them from receiving\nor engaging in speech that the First Amendment protects and does\nnot appreciably advance the State\u2019s goal of protecting children\nfrom recidivist sex offenders. I am therefore compelled to conclude\nthat, while the law before us addresses a critical problem, it\nsweeps far too broadly to satisfy the demands of the Free Speech\nClause.[15]IIWhile I thus agree with the Court that the\nparticular law at issue in this case violates the First Amendment,\nI am troubled by the Court\u2019s loose rhetoric. After noting that \u201ca\nstreet or a park is a quintessential forum for the exercise of\nFirst Amendment rights,\u201d the Court states that \u201ccyberspace\u201d and\n\u201csocial media in particular\u201d are now \u201cthe most important places (in\na spatial sense) for the exchange of views.\u201dAnte, at 4\u20135.\nThe Court declines to explain what this means with respect to free\nspeech law, and the Court holds no more than that the North\nCarolina law fails the test for content-neutral \u201ctime, place, and\nmanner\u201d restrictions. But if the entirety of the internet or even\njust \u201csocial media\u201d sites[16] are the 21st century equivalent of public streets and\nparks, then States may have little ability to restrict the sites\nthat may be visited by even the most dangerous sex offenders. May a\nState preclude an adult previously convicted of molesting children\nfrom visiting a dating site for teenagers? Or a site where minors\ncommunicate with each other about per-sonal problems? The Court\nshould be more attentive to the implications of its rhetoric for,\ncontrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, there are important differences\nbetween cyberspace and the physical world.I will mention a few that are relevant to\ninternet use by sex offenders. First, it is easier for parents to\nmonitor the physical locations that their children visit and the\nindividuals with whom they speak in person than it is to monitor\ntheir internet use. Second, if a sex offender is seen approaching\nchildren or loitering in a place fre-quented by children, this\nconduct may be observed by parents, teachers, or others. Third, the\ninternet offers an unprecedented degree of anonymity and easily\npermits a would-be molester to assume a false identity.The Court is correct that we should be cautious\nin applying our free speech precedents to the internet.Ante, at 6. Cyberspace is different from the physical world,\nand if it is true, as the Court believes, that \u201cwe cannot\nappreciate yet\u201d the \u201cfull dimensions and vast potential\u201d of \u201cthe\nCyber Age,\u201dibid., we should proceed circumspectly, taking\none step at a time. It is regrettable that the Court has not heeded\nits own admonition of caution.Notes1See Pew Research Center,\nTeens, Social Media, and Privacy 5(May 21, 2013),\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/files/2013/05/PIP_TeensSocialMediaandPrivacy_PDF.pdf(all internet materials as last visited June 16, 2017); J.\nWolak, K.
