I write\nseparately to note that for me, unlike for Justice Ginsburg, seepost,at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment), the memorandum of agreement between the Army Corps of\nEngineers and the Environmental Protection Agency is central to the\ndisposition of this case. For an agency action to be final, \u201cthe\naction must be one by which rights or obligations have been\ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201dBennettv.Spear, 520 U.\u00a0S. 154, 178 (1997) . As\nthe Court states, the memorandum of agreement establishes that\njurisdictional determinations (JDs) are \u201cbinding on the Government\nand represent the Government\u2019s position in any subsequent Federal\naction or litigation concerning that final determination.\u201d\nMemorandum of Agreement \u00a7\u00a7IV\u2013C\u20132, VI\u2013A;ante, at 6\n(major-ity opinion). A negative JD thus prevents the Corps and\nEPA\u2014the two agencies with authority to enforce the Clean Water\nAct\u2014from bringing a civil action against a property owner for the\nJD\u2019s entire 5-year lifetime.Ante, at 6\u20137, and n.\u00a03.\nThe creation of that safe harbor, which binds the agencies in any\nsubsequent litigation, is a \u201cdirect and appreciable legal\nconsequence[\u00a0]\u201d satisfying the second prong ofBennett.\n520 U.\u00a0S., at 178.",
