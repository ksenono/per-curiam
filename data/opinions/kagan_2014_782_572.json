BAY MILLS\nINDIANCOMMUNITY et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[May 27, 2014]Justice Kagan\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.The question in this\ncase is whether tribal sovereign immunity bars Michigan\u2019s\nsuit against the Bay Mills Indian Community for opening a casino\noutside Indian lands. We hold that immunity protects Bay Mills from\nthis legal action. Congress has not abrogated tribal sovereign\nimmunity from a State\u2019s suit to enjoin gaming off a\nreservation or other Indian lands. And we decline to revisit our\nprior decisions holding that, absent such an abrogation (or a\nwaiver), Indian tribes have immunity even when a suit arises from\noff-reservation commercial activity. Michigan must therefore resort\nto other mechanisms, including legal actions against the\nresponsible individuals, to resolve this dispute.IThe Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act (IGRA or Act), 102Stat. 2467, 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72701 et\u00a0seq., creates a framework for regulating gaming\nactivity on Indian lands.[1]\nSee \u00a72702(3) (describing the statute\u2019s purpose as\nestablishing \u201cregulatory authority .\u00a0.\u00a0. [and]\nstandards for gaming on Indian lands\u201d). The Act divides\ngaming into three classes. Class III gaming, the most closely\nregulated and the kind involved here, includes casino games, slot\nmachines, and horse racing. See \u00a72703(8). A tribe may conduct\nsuch gaming on Indian lands only pursuant to, and in compliance\nwith, a compact it has negotiated with the sur-rounding State. See\n\u00a72710(d)(1)(C). A compact typically prescribes rules for\noperating gaming, allocates law enforcement authority between the\ntribe and State, and provides remedies for breach of the\nagreement\u2019s terms. See \u00a7\u00a72710(d)(3)(C)(ii), (v).\nNotable here, IGRA itself authorizes a State to bring suit against\na tribe for certain conduct violating a compact: Specifically,\n\u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) allows a State to sue in federal court to\n\u201cenjoin a class III gaming activity located on Indian lands\nand conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that is in effect.\u201dPursuant to the Act,\nMichigan and Bay Mills, a federally recognized Indian Tribe,\nentered into a compact in 1993. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n73a\u201396a. The compact empowers Bay Mills to conduct class III\ngaming on \u201cIndian lands\u201d; conversely, it prohibits the\nTribe from doing so outside that territory. Id., at 78a, 83a; see\nn.\u00a01, supra. The compact also contains a dispute resolution\nmechanism, which sends to arbitration any contractual differences\nthe parties cannot settle on their own. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n89a\u201390a. A provision within that arbitration section states\nthat \u201c[n]othing in this Compact shall be deemed a\nwaiver\u201d of either the Tribe\u2019s or the State\u2019s\nsovereign immunity. Id., at 90a. Since entering into the com-pact,\nBay Mills has operated class III gaming, as authorized, on its\nreservation in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.In 2010, Bay Mills\nopened another class III gaming facility in Vanderbilt, a small\nvillage in Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula about 125 miles from\nthe Tribe\u2019s reservation. Bay Mills had bought the Vanderbilt\nproperty with accrued interest from a federal appropriation, which\nCongress had made to compensate the Tribe for 19th-century takings\nof its ancestral lands. See Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement\nAct, 111Stat. 2652. Congress had directed that a portion of the\nappropriated funds go into a \u201cLand Trust\u201d whose\nearnings the Tribe was to use to improve or purchase property.\nAccording to the legislation, any land so acquired \u201cshall be\nheld as Indian lands are held.\u201d \u00a7107(a)(3), id., at\n2658. Citing that provision, Bay Mills contended that the\nVanderbilt property was \u201cIndian land\u201d under IGRA and\nthe compact; and the Tribe thus claimed authority to operate a\ncasino there.Michigan disagreed: The\nState sued Bay Mills in federal court to enjoin operation of the\nnew casino, alleging that the facility violated IGRA and the\ncompact because it was located outside Indian lands. The same day\nMichigan filed suit, the federal Department of the Interior issued\nan opinion concluding (as the State\u2019s complaint said) that\nthe Tribe\u2019s use of Land Trust earnings to purchase the\nVanderbilt property did not convert it into Indian territory. See\nApp. 69\u2013101. The District Court entered a preliminary\ninjunction against Bay Mills, which promptly shut down the new\ncasino and took an interlocutory appeal. While that appeal was\npending, Michigan amended its complaint to join various tribal\nofficials as defendants, as well as to add state law and federal\ncommon law claims. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit then\nvacated the injunction, holding (among other things) that tribal\nsovereign immunity barred Michigan\u2019s suit against Bay Mills\nunless Congress provided otherwise, and that\n\u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) did not authorize the action. See 695\nF.\u00a03d 406, 413\u2013415 (2012). That provision of IGRA, the\nSixth Circuit reasoned, permitted a suit against the Tribe to\nenjoin only gaming activity located on Indian lands, whereas the\nState\u2019s complaint alleged that the Vanderbilt casino was\noutside such territory. See id., at 412.[2] Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that\nMichigan could proceed, if at all, solely against the individual\ndefendants, and it remanded to the District Court to consider those\nclaims. See id., at 416\u2013417.[3] Although no injunc-tion is currently in effect, Bay\nMills has not reopened the Vanderbilt casino.We granted certiorari\nto consider whether tribal sovereign immunity bars Michigan\u2019s\nsuit against Bay Mills, 570 U.\u00a0S. __ (2013), and we now affirm\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.IIIndian tribes are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018domestic dependent nations\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthat exercise \u201cinherent sovereign authority.\u201d Oklahoma\nTax Comm\u2019n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498\nU.\u00a0S. 505, 509 (1991) (Potawatomi) (quoting Cherokee Nation v.\nGeorgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831)). As dependents, the tribes are\nsubject to plenary control by Congress. See United States v. Lara,\n541 U.\u00a0S. 193, 200 (2004) (\u201c[T]he Constitution grants\nCongress\u201d powers \u201cwe have consistently described as\n\u2018plenary and exclusive\u2019\u00a0\u201d to\n\u201clegislate in respect to Indian tribes\u201d). And yet they\nremain \u201cseparate sovereigns pre-existing the\nConstitution.\u201d Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.\u00a0S.\n49, 56 (1978) . Thus, unless and \u201cuntil Congress acts, the\ntribes retain\u201d their historic sovereign authority. United\nStates v. Wheeler, 435 U.\u00a0S. 313, 323 (1978) .Among the core aspects\nof sovereignty that tribes possess\u2014subject, again, to\ncongressional action\u2014is the \u201ccommon-law immunity from\nsuit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.\u201d Santa Clara\nPueblo, 436 U.\u00a0S., at 58. That immunity, we have explained, is\n\u201ca necessary corollary to Indian sovereignty and\nself-governance.\u201d Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold\nReservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U.\u00a0S. 877, 890\n(1986) ; cf. The Federalist No. 81, p. 511 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (A.\nHamilton) (It is \u201cinherent in the nature of sovereignty not\nto be amenable\u201d to suit without consent). And the qualified\nnature of Indian sovereignty modifies that principle only by\nplacing a tribe\u2019s immunity, like its other governmental\npowers and attributes, in Congress\u2019s hands. See United States\nv. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.\u00a0S. 506,\n512 (1940) (USF&G) (\u201cIt is as though the immunity which\nwas theirs as sovereigns passed to the United States for their\nbenefit\u201d). Thus, we have time and again treated the\n\u201cdoctrine of tribal immunity [as] settled law\u201d and\ndismissed any suit against a tribe absent congressional\nauthorization (or a waiver). Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing\nTechnologies, Inc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 751, 756 (1998) .In doing so, we have\nheld that tribal immunity applies no less to suits brought by\nStates (including in their own courts) than to those by\nindividuals. First in Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of\nWash., 433 U.\u00a0S. 165 \u2013168, 172\u2013173 (1977), and\nthen again in Potawatomi, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 509\u2013510, we\nbarred a State seeking to enforce its laws from filing suit against\na tribe, rejecting arguments grounded in the State\u2019s own\nsovereignty. In each case, we said a State must resort to other\nremedies, even if they would be less \u201cefficient.\u201d Id.,\nat 514; see Kiowa, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 755 (\u201cThere is a\ndifference between the right to demand compliance with state laws\nand the means available to enforce them\u201d). That is because,\nas we have often stated (and contrary to the dissent\u2019s novel\npronouncement, see post, at 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (hereinafter\nthe dissent)), tribal immunity \u201cis a matter of federal law\nand is not subject to diminution by the States.\u201d 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 756 (citing Three Affiliated Tribes, 476 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 891; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,\n447 U.\u00a0S. 134, 154 (1980) ). Or as we elsewhere explained:\nWhile each State at the Constitutional Convention surrendered its\nimmunity from suit by sister States, \u201cit would be absurd to\nsuggest that the tribes\u201d\u2014at a conference \u201cto\nwhich they were not even parties\u201d\u2014similarly ceded their\nimmunity against state-initiated suits. Blatchford v. Native\nVillage of Noatak, 501 U.\u00a0S. 775, 782 (1991) .Equally important here,\nwe declined in Kiowa to make any exception for suits arising from a\ntribe\u2019s commercial activities, even when they take place off\nIndian lands. In that case, a private party sued a tribe in state\ncourt for defaulting on a promissory note. The plaintiff asked this\nCourt to confine tribal immunity to suits involving conduct on\n\u201creservations or to noncommercial activities.\u201d 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 758. We said no. We listed Puyallup, Potawa-tomi,\nand USF&G as precedents applying immunity to a suit predicated\non a tribe\u2019s commercial conduct\u2014respectively, fishing,\nselling cigarettes, and leasing coal mines. 523 U.\u00a0S., at\n754\u2013755. Too, we noted that Puyallup involved enterprise\n\u201cboth on and off [the Tribe\u2019s] reservation.\u201d 523\nU.\u00a0S., at 754 (quoting 433 U.\u00a0S., at 167). \u201c[O]ur\nprecedents,\u201d we thus concluded, have not previously\n\u201cdrawn the[ ] distinctions\u201d the plaintiff pressed in\nthe case. 523 U.\u00a0S., at 755. They had established a broad\nprinciple, from which we thought it improper suddenly to start\ncarving out exceptions. Rather, we opted to \u201cdefer\u201d to\nCongress about whether to abrogate tribal immunity for\noff-reservation commercial conduct. Id., at 758, 760; see infra, at\n17\u201318.Our decisions establish\nas well that such a congressional decision must be clear. The\nbaseline position, we have often held, is tribal immunity; and\n\u201c[t]o abrogate [such] immunity, Congress must\n\u2018unequivocally\u2019 express that purpose.\u201d\nC\u00a0&\u00a0L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi\nTribe of Okla., 532 U.\u00a0S. 411, 418 (2001) (quoting Santa Clara\nPueblo, 436 U.\u00a0S., at 58). That rule of construction reflects\nan enduring principle of Indian law: Although Congress has plenary\nauthority over tribes, courts will not lightly assume that Congress\nin fact intends to undermine Indian self-government. See, e.g.,\nid., at 58\u201360; Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.\u00a0S.\n9, 18 (1987) ; United States v. Dion, 476 U.\u00a0S. 734 \u2013739\n(1986).The upshot is this:\nUnless Congress has authorized Michigan\u2019s suit, our\nprecedents demand that it be dismissed.[4] And so Michigan, naturally enough, makes two arguments:\nfirst, that IGRA indeed abrogates the Tribe\u2019s immunity from\nthe State\u2019s suit; and second, that if it does not, we should\nrevisit\u2014and reverse\u2014our decision in Kiowa, so that\ntribal immunity no longer applies to claims arising from commercial\nactivity outside Indian lands. We consider\u2014and\nreject\u2014each contention in turn.IIIIGRA partially\nabrogates tribal sovereign immunity in\n\u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii)\u2014but this case, viewed most naturally,\nfalls outside that term\u2019s ambit. The provision, as noted\nabove, authorizes a State to sue a tribe to \u201cenjoin a class\nIII gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in\nviolation of any Tribal-State compact.\u201d See supra, at 2;\nKiowa, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 758 (citing the provision as an example\nof legislation \u201crestrict[ing] tribal immunity from suit in\nlimited circumstances\u201d). A key phrase in that abrogation is\n\u201con Indian lands\u201d\u2014three words reflecting\nIGRA\u2019s overall scope (and repeated some two dozen times in\nthe statute). A State\u2019s suit to enjoin gaming activity on\nIndian lands (assuming other requirements are met, see n.\u00a06,\ninfra) falls within \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii); a similar suit to stop\ngaming activity off Indian lands does not. And that creates a\nfundamental problem for Michigan. After all, the very premise of\nthis suit\u2014the reason Michigan thinks Bay Mills is acting\nunlawfully\u2014is that the Vanderbilt casino is outside Indian\nlands. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a\u201360a. By dint of that\ntheory, a suit to enjoin gaming in Vanderbilt is correspondingly\noutside \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii)\u2019s abrogation of immunity.Michigan first attempts\nto fit this suit within \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) by relocating the\n\u201cclass III gaming activity\u201d to which it is objecting.\nTrue enough, Michigan states, the Vanderbilt casino lies outside\nIndian lands. But Bay Mills \u201cauthorized, licensed, and\noperated\u201d that casino from within its own reservation. Brief\nfor Michigan 20. According to the State, that necessary\nadministrative action\u2014no less than, say, dealing\ncraps\u2014is \u201cclass III gaming activ-ity,\u201d and\nbecause it occurred on Indian land, this suit to enjoin it can go\nforward.But that argument comes\nup snake eyes, because numerous provisions of IGRA show that\n\u201cclass III gaming activity\u201d means just what it sounds\nlike\u2014the stuff involved in playing class III games. For\nexample, \u00a72710(d)(3)(C)(i) refers to \u201cthe licensing and\nregulation of [a class III gaming] activity\u201d and\n\u00a72710(d)(9) concerns the \u201coperation of a class III\ngaming activity.\u201d Those phrases make perfect sense if\n\u201cclass III gaming activity\u201d is what goes on in a\ncasino\u2014each roll of the dice and spin of the wheel. But they\nlose all meaning if, as Michigan argues, \u201cclass III gaming\nactivity\u201d refers equally to the off-site licensing or\noperation of the games. (Just plug in those words and see what\nhappens.) See also \u00a7\u00a72710(b)(2)(A), (b)(4)(A), (c)(4),\n(d)(1)(A) (similarly referring to class II or III \u201cgaming\nactivity\u201d). The same holds true throughout the statute.\nSection 2717(a)(1) specifies fees to be paid by \u201ceach gaming\noperation that conducts a class II or class III gaming\nactivity\u201d\u2014signifying that the gaming activity is the\ngambling in the poker hall, not the proceedings of the off-site\nadministrative authority. And \u00a7\u00a72706(a)(5) and 2713(b)(1)\ntogether describe a federal agency\u2019s power to \u201cclos[e]\na gaming activity\u201d for \u201csubstantial violation[s]\u201d\nof law\u2014e.g., to shut down crooked blackjack tables, not the\ntribal regulatory body meant to oversee them. Indeed, consider\nIGRA\u2019s very first finding: Many tribes, Congress stated,\n\u201chave licensed gaming activities on Indian lands,\u201d\nthereby necessitating federal regulation. \u00a72701(1). The\n\u201cgaming activit[y]\u201d is (once again) the gambling. And\nthat means \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does not allow Michigan\u2019s\nsuit even if Bay Mills took action on its reservation to license or\noversee the Vanderbilt facility.Stymied under\n\u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii), Michigan next urges us to adopt a\n\u201cholistic method\u201d of interpreting IGRA that would allow\na State to sue a tribe for illegal gaming off, no less than on,\nIndian lands. Brief for Michigan 30. Michi-gan asks here that we\nconsider \u201cIGRA\u2019s text and structure as a whole.\u201d\nId., at 28. But (with one briefly raised exception) Michigan fails\nto identify any specific textual or structural features of the\nstatute to support its proposed result.[5] Rather, Michigan highlights a (purported) anomaly of\nthe statute as written: that it enables a State to sue a tribe for\nillegal gaming inside, but not outside, Indian country.\n\u201c[W]hy,\u201d Michigan queries, \u201cwould Congress\nauthorize a state to obtain a federal injunction against illegal\ntribal gaming on Indian lands, but not on lands subject to the\nstate\u2019s own sovereign jurisdiction?\u201d Reply Brief 1.\nThat question has no answer, Michigan argues: Whatever words\nCongress may have used in IGRA, it could not have intended that\nsenseless outcome. See Brief for Michigan 28.But this Court does not\nrevise legislation, as Michigan proposes, just because the text as\nwritten creates an apparent anomaly as to some subject it does not\naddress. Truth be told, such anomalies often arise from statutes,\nif for no other reason than that Congress typically legislates by\nparts\u2014addressing one thing without examining all others that\nmight merit comparable treatment. Rejecting a similar argument that\na statutory anomaly (between property and non-property taxes) made\n\u201cnot a whit of sense,\u201d we explained in one recent case\nthat \u201cCongress wrote the statute it\nwrote\u201d\u2014meaning, a statute going so far and no further.\nSee CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17\u201318). The same could be said\nof IGRA\u2019s abrogation of tribal immunity for gaming \u201con\nIndian lands.\u201d This Court has no roving license, in even\nordinary cases of statutory interpretation, to disregard clear\nlanguage simply on the view that (in Michigan\u2019s words)\nCongress \u201cmust have intended\u201d something broader. Brief\nfor Michigan 32. And still less do we have that warrant when the\nconsequence would be to expand an abrogation of immunity, because\n(as explained earlier) \u201cCongress must\n\u2018unequivocally\u2019 express [its] purpose\u201d to subject\na tribe to litigation. C\u00a0&\u00a0L Enterprises, 532\nU.\u00a0S., at 418; see supra, at 7.In any event,\nIGRA\u2019s history and design provide a more than intelligible\nanswer to the question Michigan poses about why Congress would have\nconfined a State\u2019s authority to sue a tribe as\n\u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) does. Congress adopted IGRA in response to\nthis Court\u2019s decision in California v. Cabazon Band of\nMission Indians, 480 U.\u00a0S. 202 \u2013222 (1987), which held\nthat States lacked any regulatory authority over gaming on Indian\nlands. Cabazon left fully intact a State\u2019s regulatory power\nover tribal gaming outside Indian territory\u2014which, as we will\nsoon show, is capacious. See infra, at 12\u201313. So the problem\nCongress set out to address in IGRA (Cabazon\u2019s ouster of\nstate authority) arose in Indian lands alone. And the solution\nCongress devised, naturally enough, reflected that fact. See, e.g.,\nSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.\u00a0S. 44, 58 (1996)\n(\u201c[T]he Act grants the States a power that they would not\notherwise have, viz., some measure of author-ity over gaming on\nIndian lands\u201d). Everything\u2014literally\neverything\u2014in IGRA affords tools (for either state or federal\nofficials) to regulate gaming on Indian lands, and nowhere else.\nSmall surprise that IGRA\u2019s abrogation of tribal immunity does\nthat as well.[6]And the resulting\nworld, when considered functionally, is not nearly so\n\u201cenigma[tic]\u201d as Michigan suggests. Reply Brief 1. True\nenough, a State lacks the ability to sue a tribe for illegal gaming\nwhen that activity occurs off the reservation. But a State, on its\nown lands, has many other powers over tribal gaming that it does\nnot possess (absent consent) in Indian territory. Unless federal\nlaw provides differently, \u201cIndians going beyond reservation\nboundaries\u201d are subject to any generally applicable state\nlaw. See Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, 546 U.\u00a0S.\n95, 113 (2005) (quoting Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411\nU.\u00a0S. 145, 148 (1973) ). So, for example, Michigan could, in\nthe first instance, deny a license to Bay Mills for an\noff-reservation casino. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7432.206\u2013432.206a (West 2001). And if Bay Mills\nwent ahead anyway, Michigan could bring suit against tribal\nofficials or employees (rather than the Tribe itself\u00a0) seeking\nan injunction for, say, gambling without a license. See\n\u00a7432.220; see also \u00a7600.3801(1)(a) (West 2013)\n(designating illegal gambling facilities as public nuisances). As\nthis Court has stated before, analogizing to Ex parte Young, 209\nU.\u00a0S. 123 (1908) , tribal immunity does not bar such a suit\nfor injunctive relief against individuals, includ-ing tribal\nofficers, responsible for unlawful conduct. See Santa Clara Pueblo,\n436 U.\u00a0S., at 59. And to the extent civil remedies proved\ninadequate, Michigan could resort to its criminal law, prosecuting\nanyone who maintains\u2014or even frequents\u2014an unlawful\ngambling establishment. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7432.218 (West 2001), 750.303, 750.309 (West 2004). In\nshort (and contrary to the dissent\u2019s unsupported assertion,\nsee post, at 11), the panoply of tools Michigan can use to enforce\nits law on its own lands\u2014no less than the suit it could bring\non Indian lands under \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii)\u2014can shutter,\nquickly and permanently, an illegal casino.[7]Finally, if a State\nreally wants to sue a tribe for gaming outside Indian lands, the\nState need only bargain for a waiver of immunity. Under IGRA, a\nState and tribe negotiating a compact \u201cmay include\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. remedies for breach of contract,\u201d 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72710(d)(3)(C)(v)\u2014including a\nprovision allowing the State to bring an action against the tribe\nin the circumstances presented here. States have more than enough\nleverage to obtain such terms because a tribe cannot conduct class\nIII gaming on its lands without a compact, see \u00a72710(d)(1)(C),\nand cannot sue to enforce a State\u2019s duty to negotiate a\ncompact in good faith, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 47\n(holding a State immune from such suits). So as Michigan\nforthrightly acknowl-edges, \u201ca party dealing with a tribe in\ncontract negotiations has the power to protect itself by refusing\nto deal absent the tribe\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity from\nsuit.\u201d Brief for Michigan 40. And many States have taken that\npath. See Brief for Seminole Tribe of Florida et\u00a0al. as Amici\nCuriae 12\u201322 (listing compacts with waivers of tribal\nimmunity). To be sure, Michigan did not: As noted earlier, the\ncompact at issue here, instead of authorizing judicial remedies,\nsends disputes to arbitration and expressly retains each\nparty\u2019s sovereign immunity. See supra, at 2. But\nMichigan\u2014like any State\u2014could have insisted on a\ndifferent deal (and indeed may do so now for the future, because\nthe current compact has expired and remains in effect only until\nthe parties negotiate a new one, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 21). And in\nthat event, the limitation Congress placed on IGRA\u2019s\nabrogation of tribal immunity\u2014whether or not anomalous as an\nabstract matter\u2014would have made no earthly difference.IVBecause IGRA\u2019s\nplain terms do not abrogate Bay Mills\u2019 immunity from this\nsuit, Michigan (and the dissent) must make a more dramatic\nargument: that this Court should \u201crevisit[ ] Kiowa\u2019s\nholding\u201d and rule that tribes \u201chave no immunity for\nillegal commercial activity outside their sovereign\nterritory.\u201d Reply Brief 8, 10; see post, at 1. Michigan\nargues that tribes increasingly participate in off-reservation\ngaming and other commercial activity, and operate in that capacity\nless as governments than as private businesses. See Brief for\nMichigan 38 (noting, among other things, that \u201ctribal gaming\nrevenues have more than tripled\u201d since Kiowa). Further,\nMichigan contends, tribes have broader immunity from suits arising\nfrom such conduct than other sovereigns\u2014most notably, because\nCongress enacted legislation limiting foreign nations\u2019\nimmunity for commercial activity in the United States. See id., at\n41; 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(2). It is time, Michigan\nconcludes, to \u201clevel[ ] the playing field.\u201d Brief for\nMichigan 38.But this Court does not\noverturn its precedents lightly. Stare decisis, we have stated,\n\u201cis the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded,\npredictable, and consistent development of legal principles,\nfosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the\nactual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 827 (1991) . Although\n\u201cnot an inexorable command,\u201d id., at 828, stare decisis\nis a foundation stone of the rule of law, necessary to ensure that\nlegal rules develop \u201cin a principled and intelligible\nfashion,\u201d Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.\u00a0S. 254, 265 (1986)\n. For that reason, this Court has always held that \u201cany\ndeparture\u201d from the doctrine \u201cdemands special\njustification.\u201d Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.\u00a0S. 203, 212\n(1984) .And that is more than\nusually so in the circumstances here. First, Kiowa itself was no\none-off: Rather, in rejecting the identical argument Michigan\nmakes, our decision reaffirmed a long line of precedents,\nconcluding that \u201cthe doctrine of tribal\nimmunity\u201d\u2014without any exceptions for commercial or\noff-reservation conduct\u2014\u201cis settled law and controls\nthis case.\u201d 523 U.\u00a0S., at 756; see id., at\n754\u2013755; supra, at 5\u20137. Second, we have relied on Kiowa\nsubsequently: In another case involving a tribe\u2019s\noff-reservation commercial conduct, we began our analysis with\nKiowa\u2019s holding that tribal immunity applies to such activity\n(and then found that the Tribe had waived its protection). See\nC\u00a0&\u00a0L Enterprises, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 418. Third,\ntribes across the country, as well as entities and individuals\ndoing business with them, have for many years relied on Kiowa\n(along with its forebears and progeny), negotiating their contracts\nand structuring their transactions against a backdrop of tribal\nimmunity. As in other cases involving contract and property rights,\nconcerns of stare decisis are thus \u201cat their acme.\u201d\nState Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.\u00a0S. 3, 20 (1997) . And fourth (a\npoint we will later revisit, see infra, at 17\u201320), Congress\nexercises primary authority in this area and \u201cremains free to\nalter what we have done\u201d\u2014another factor that gives\n\u201cspecial force\u201d to stare decisis. Patterson v. McLean\nCredit Union, 491 U.\u00a0S. 164 \u2013173 (1989). To overcome all\nthese reasons for this Court to stand pat, Michigan would need an\nace up its sleeve.[8]But instead, all the\nState musters are retreads of assertions we have rejected before.\nKiowa expressly considered the view, now offered by Michigan, that\n\u201cwhen tribes take part in the Nation\u2019s commerce,\u201d\nimmunity \u201cextends beyond what is needed to safeguard tribal\nself-governance.\u201d 523 U.\u00a0S., at 758. (Indeed, as Kiowa\nnoted, see id., at 757, Potawatomi had less than a decade earlier\nrejected Oklahoma\u2019s identical contention that \u201cbecause\ntribal business activities .\u00a0.\u00a0. are now so detached from\ntraditional tribal interests,\u201d immunity \u201cno longer\nmakes sense in [the commercial] context,\u201d 498 U.\u00a0S., at\n510.) So too, the Kiowa Court comprehended the trajectory of\ntribes\u2019 commercial activity (which is the dissent\u2019s\nexclusive rationale for ignoring stare decisis, see post, at\n10\u201313). In the preceding decade, tribal gaming revenues had\nincreased more than thirty fold[9] (dwarfing the still strong rate of growth since that\ntime, see supra, at 14\u201315); and Kiowa noted the flourishing\nof other tribal enterprises, ranging from cigarette sales to ski\nresorts, see 523 U.\u00a0S., at 758. Moreover, the Kiowa Court\nunderstood that other sovereigns did not enjoy similar immunity for\ncommercial activities outside their territory; that seeming\n\u201canomal[y]\u201d was a principal point in the dissenting\nopinion. See id., at 765 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Kiowa did more,\nin fact, than acknowledge those arguments; it expressed a fair bit\nof sympathy toward them. See id., at 758 (noting \u201creasons to\ndoubt the wisdom of perpetuating the doctrine\u201d as to\noff-reservation commercial conduct). Yet the decision could not\nhave been any clearer: \u201cWe decline to draw [any]\ndistinction\u201d that would \u201cconfine [immunity] to\nreservations or to noncommercial activities.\u201d Ibid.We ruled that way for a\nsingle, simple reason: because it is fundamentally Congress\u2019s\njob, not ours, to determine whether or how to limit tribal\nimmunity. The special brand of sovereignty the tribes\nretain\u2014both its nature and its extent\u2014rests in the\nhands of Congress. See Lara, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 200; Wheeler, 435\nU.\u00a0S., at 323. Kiowa chose to respect that congressional\nresponsibility (as Potawatomi had a decade earlier) when it\nrejected the precursor to Michigan\u2019s argument: Whatever our\nview of the merits, we explained, \u201cwe defer to the role\nCongress may wish to exercise in this important judgment.\u201d\n523 U.\u00a0S., at 758; see Potawatomi, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 510\n(stating that because \u201cCongress has always been at liberty to\ndispense with\u201d or limit tribal immunity, \u201cwe are not\ndisposed to modify\u201d its scope). Congress, we\nsaid\u2014drawing an analogy to its role in shaping foreign\nsovereign immunity[10]\u2014has the greater capacity \u201cto weigh and\naccommodate the competing policy concerns and reliance\ninterests\u201d involved in the issue. 523 U.\u00a0S., at 759. And\nCongress repeatedly had done just that: It had restricted tribal\nimmunity \u201cin limited circum-stances\u201d (including, we\nnoted, in \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii)), while \u201cin other\nstatutes\u201d declaring an \u201cintention not to alter\u201d\nthe doctrine. Id., at 758; see Potawatomi, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 510\n(citing statutory provisions involving tribal immunity). So too, we\nthought, Congress should make the call whether to curtail a\ntribe\u2019s immunity for off-reservation commer-cial\nconduct\u2014and the Court should accept Congress\u2019s\njudgment.All that we said in\nKiowa applies today, with yet one more thing: Congress has now\nreflected on Kiowa and made an initial (though of course not\nirrevocable) decision to retain that form of tribal immunity.\nFollowing Kiowa, Congress considered several bills to substantially\nmodify tribal immunity in the commercial context. Two in\nparticular\u2014drafted by the chair of the Senate Appropriations\nSubcommittee on the Interior\u2014expressly referred to Kiowa and\nbroadly abrogated tribal immunity for most torts and breaches of\ncontract. See S. 2299, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); S. 2302, 105th\nCong., 2d Sess. (1998). But instead of adopting those reversals of\nKiowa, Congress chose to enact a far more modest alternative\nrequiring tribes either to disclose or to waive their immunity in\ncontracts needing the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s approval.\nSee Indian Tribal Economic Development and Contract Encouragement\nAct of 2000, \u00a72, 114Stat. 46 (codified at 25\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a781(d)(2)); see also F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law \u00a77.05[1][b], p. 643 (2012). Since then,\nCongress has continued to exercise its plenary authority over\ntribal immunity, specifically preserving immunity in some contexts\nand abrogating it in others, but never adopting the change Michigan\nwants.[11] So rather than\nconfronting, as we did in Kiowa, a legislative vacuum as to the\nprecise issue presented, we act today against the backdrop of a\ncongressional choice: to retain tribal immunity (at least for now)\nin a case like this one.[12]Reversing Kiowa in\nthese circumstances would scale the heights of presumption: Beyond\nupending \u201clong-established principle[s] of tribal sovereign\nimmunity,\u201d that action would replace Congress\u2019s\nconsidered judgment with our contrary opinion. Potawatomi, 498\nU.\u00a0S., at 510. As Kiowa recognized, a fundamental commitment\nof Indian law is judicial respect for Congress\u2019s primary role\nin defining the contours of tribal sovereignty. See 523 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 758\u2013760; see also Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.\u00a0S., at\n60 (\u201c[A] proper respect .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the plenary\nauthority of Congress in this area cautions that [the courts] tread\nlightly\u201d); Cohen, supra, \u00a72.01[1], at 110\n(\u201cJudicial deference to the paramount authority of Congress\nin matters concerning Indian policy remains a central and\nindispensable principle of the field of Indian law\u201d). That\ncommitment gains only added force when Congress has already\nreflected on an issue of tribal sovereignty, including immunity\nfrom suit, and declined to change settled law. And that force must\ngrow greater still when Congress considered that issue partly at\nour urging. See Kiowa, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 758 (hinting, none too\nsubtly, that \u201cCongress may wish to exercise\u201d its\nauthority over the question presented). Having held in Kiowa that\nthis issue is up to Congress, we cannot reverse ourselves because\nsome may think its conclusion wrong. Congress of course may always\nchange its mind\u2014and we would readily defer to that new\ndecision. But it is for Congress, now more than ever, to say\nwhether to create an exception to tribal immunity for\noff-reservation commercial activity. As in Kiowa\u2014except still\nmore so\u2014\u201cwe decline to revisit our case law[,] and\nchoose\u201d instead \u201cto defer to Congress.\u201d Id., at\n760.VAs \u201cdomestic\ndependent nations,\u201d Indian tribes exercise sovereignty\nsubject to the will of the Federal Government. Cherokee Nation, 5\nPet., at 17. Sovereignty implies immunity from lawsuits. Subjection\nmeans (among much else) that Congress can abrogate that immunity as\nand to the extent it wishes. If Congress had authorized this suit,\nBay Mills would have no valid grounds to object. But Congress has\nnot done so: The abrogation of immunity in IGRA applies to gaming\non, but not off, Indian lands. We will not rewrite Congress\u2019s\nhandiwork. Nor will we create a freestanding exception to tribal\nimmunity for all off-reservation commercial conduct. This Court has\ndeclined that course once before. To choose it now would entail\nboth overthrowing our precedent and usurping Congress\u2019s\ncurrent policy judgment. Accordingly, Michigan may not sue Bay\nMills to enjoin the Vanderbilt casino, but must instead use\navailable alternative means to accomplish that object.We affirm the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Act defines\n\u201cIndian lands\u201d as \u201c(A) all lands within the\nlimits of any Indian reservation; and (B) any lands title to which\nis either held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any\nIndian tribe or individual[,] or held by any Indian tribe or\nindividual subject to restriction by the United States against\nalienation and over which an Indian tribe exercises governmental\npower.\u201d \u00a72703(4).2The Sixth Circuit framed\npart of its analysis in jurisdictional terms, holding that the\nDistrict Court had no authority to consider Michigan\u2019s IGRA\nclaim because \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) provides federal jurisdiction\nonly over suits to enjoin gaming on Indian lands (and\nMichigan\u2019s suit was not that). See 695 F.\u00a03d, at\n412\u2013413. That reasoning is wrong, as all parties agree. See\nBrief for Michigan 22\u201325; Brief for Bay Mills 23\u201324;\nBrief for United States as 16\u201317. The general\nfederal-question statute, , gives a district court subject matter\njurisdiction to decide any claim alleging a violation of IGRA.\nNothing in \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii) or any other provision of IGRA\nlimits that grant of jurisdiction (although those provisions may\nindicate that a party has no statutory right of action). See v. ,\n\u2013644 (2002).3The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision applied not only to Michigan\u2019s case,\nbut also to a consolidated case brought by the Little Traverse Bay\nBands of Odawa Indians, which operates a casino about 40 miles from\nthe Vanderbilt property. Little Traverse subsequently dismissed its\nsuit, rather than seek review in this Court.4Michigan does not argue\nhere that Bay Mills waived its immunity from suit. Recall that the\ncompact expressly preserves both the Tribe\u2019s and the\nState\u2019s sovereign immunity. See , at 2.5Michigan\u2019s single\nreference to another statutory provision, , does not advance its\nargument, because that term includes a geographical limitation\nsimilar to the one appearing in \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii). Section\n1166 makes a State\u2019s gambling laws applicable \u201cin\nIndian country\u201d as federal law, and then gives the Federal\nGovernment \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over criminal\nprosecutions\u201d for violating those laws. , (d). Michigan\nbriefly argues that, by negative implication, \u00a71166 gives a\nState the power \u201cto bring a suit to enforce [its]\nanti-gambling laws in Indian country,\u201d and that this power\napplies \u201ceven when the defendant is an Indian tribe.\u201d\nBrief for Michigan 26 (emphasis added). Bay Mills and the United\nStates vigorously contest both those propositions, arguing that\n\u00a71166 gives States no civil enforcement authority at all, much\nless as against a tribe. See Brief for Bay Mills 30\u201331; Brief\nfor United States as 20\u201322. But that dispute is irrelevant\nhere. Even assuming Michigan\u2019s double inference were valid,\n\u00a71166 would still allow a State to sue a tribe for gaming only\n\u201cin Indian country.\u201d So Michigan\u2019s suit, alleging\nthat illegal gaming occurred on lands, could no more proceed under\n\u00a71166 than under \u00a72710(d)(7)(A)(ii).6Indeed, the statutory\nabrogation does not even cover all suits to enjoin gaming on Indian\nlands, thus refuting the very premise of Michigan\u2019s\nargument-from-anomaly. Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), recall, allows a\nState to sue a tribe not for all \u201cclass III gaming activity\nlocated on Indian lands\u201d (as Michigan suggests), but only for\nsuch gaming as is \u201cconducted in violation of any Tribal-State\ncompact.\u00a0.\u00a0. that is in effect.\u201d Accordingly, if a\ntribe opens a casino on Indian lands before negotiating a compact,\nthe surrounding State cannot sue; only the Federal Government can\nenforce the law. See . To be precise, then, IGRA\u2019s\nauthorization of suit mirrors not the full problem created (a\nvacuum of state authority over gaming in Indian country) but, more\nparticularly, Congress\u2019s \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d\ncompact-based solution to that difficulty. v. , \u201374 (1996).\nSo Michigan\u2019s binary challenge\u2014if a State can sue to\nstop gaming in Indian country, why not off?\u2014fails out of the\nstarting gate. In fact, a State sue to enjoin all gaming in Indian\ncountry; that gaming must, in addition, violate an agreement that\nthe State and tribe have mutually entered.7Michigan contends that\nthese alternative remedies may be more intrusive on, or less\nrespectful of, tribal sovereignty than the suit it wants to bring.\nSee Brief for Michigan 15; Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. Bay Mills, which\npresumably is better positioned to address that question,\nemphatically disagrees. See at 32\u201333. And the law supports\nBay Mills\u2019 position: Dispensing with the immunity of a\nsovereign for fear of pursuing available remedies against its\nofficers or other individuals would upend all known principles of\nsovereign immunity.8Adhering to is\nparticularly appropriate here given that the State, as we have\nshown, has many alternative remedies: It has no need to sue the\nTribe to right the wrong it alleges. See , at 12\u201313. We need\nnot consider whether the situation would be different if no\nalternative remedies were available. We have never, for example,\nspecifically addressed (nor, so far as we are aware, has Congress)\nwhether immunity should apply in the ordinary way if a tort victim,\nor other plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe, has no\nalternative way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial\nconduct. The argument that such cases would present a\n\u201cspecial justification\u201d for abandoning precedent is not\nbefore us. v. , .9See Nat. Gambling Impact\nStudy Comm\u2019n, Final Report, pp.\u00a06\u20131 to 6\u20132\n(1999), online at\nhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ngisc/reports/6.pdf (as visited Apr.\n30, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).10explained that Congress, in the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, , \u201cden[ied]\nimmunity for the commercial acts of a foreign nation,\u201d\ncodifying an earlier State Department document, known as the Tate\nLetter, announcing that policy. 523 U.\u00a0S., at 759. Michigan\ntakes issue with \u2019s account, maintaining that this Court took\nthe lead in crafting the commercial exception to foreign sovereign\nimmunity, and so should feel free to do the same thing here. See\nReply Brief 6\u20137. But the decision Michigan cites, v. , , does\nnot show what the State would like. First, Michigan points to a\npart of the opinion commanding only four votes, see , at\n695\u2013706 (opinion of White, J.); the majority\u2019s decision\nwas based on the act of state doctrine, not on anything to do with\nforeign sovereign immunity, see at 690\u2013695. And second, even\nthe plurality opinion relied heavily on the views of the Executive\nBranch as expressed in the Tate Letter\u2014going so far as to\nattach that document as an appendix. See at 696\u2013698 (opinion\nof White, J.); , at 711\u2013715 (appendix 2 to opinion of the\nCourt). The opinion therefore illustrates what highlighted: this\nCourt\u2019s historic practice of \u201cdeferr[ing] to the\ndecisions of the political branches,\u201d rather than going it\nalone, when addressing foreign sovereign immunity. v. ,\n.11Compare, , Prevent All Cigarette\nTrafficking Act of 2009, \u00a7\u00a72(e), (3)(a), (preserving\nimmunity), with Arizona Water Settlements Act,\n\u00a7\u00a7213(a)(2), 301, (abrogating immunity). The\ndissent\u2019s claim that \u201cCongress has never granted tribal\nsovereign immunity in shape or form,\u201d ,at 13, apparently does\nnot take into account the many statutes in which Congress preserved\nor otherwise ratified tribal immunity. See, , ; see generally , 498\nU.\u00a0S., at 510 (\u201cCongress has consistently reiterated its\napproval of the immunity doctrine\u201d).12The\ndissent principally counters that this history is not\n\u201crelevan[t]\u201d because was a \u201ccommon-law\ndecision.\u201d ,at 14. But that is to ignore what (in line with\nprior rulings) specifically told Congress: that tribal immunity,\nfar from any old common law doctrine, lies in Congress\u2019s\nhands to configure. See 523 U.\u00a0S., at 758; , 498 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 510; v. , \u201360 (1978). When we inform Congress that it has\nprimary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to\nconsider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem\nirrelevant how Congress responds.",
