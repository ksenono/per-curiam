YATES, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe eleventh circuit[February 25, 2015]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and\nJustice Thomas join, dissenting.A criminal law,18 U. S. C. \u00a71519, prohibits tampering with \u201cany\nrecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in an attempt to obstruct a\nfederal investigation. This case raises the question whether the\nterm \u201ctangible object\u201d means the same thing in \u00a71519 as it means in\neveryday language\u2014any object capable of being touched. The answer\nshould be easy: Yes. The term \u201ctangible object\u201d is broad, but\nclear. Throughout the U.\u00a0S. Code and many States\u2019 laws, it\ninvariably covers physical objects of all kinds. And in \u00a71519,\ncontext confirms what bare text says: All the words surrounding\n\u201ctangible object\u201d show that Congress meant the term to have a wide\nrange. That fits with Congress\u2019s evident purpose in enacting \u00a71519:\nto punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence\u2014anyphysical evidence\u2014with the intent of thwarting federal law\nenforcement.The plurality instead interprets \u201ctangible object\u201d to cover\n\u201conly objects one can use to record or preserve information.\u201dAnte, at 7. The concurring opinion similarly, if more\nvaguely, contends that \u201ctangible object\u201d should refer to \u201csomething\nsimilar to records or documents\u201d\u2014and shouldn\u2019t include colonial\nfarmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.Ante, at 1 (Alito, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). In my view, conventional tools of\nstatutory construction all lead to a more conventional result: A\n\u201ctangible object\u201d is an object that\u2019s tangible. I would apply the\nstatute that Congress enacted and affirm the judgment below.IWhile the plurality starts its analysis with \u00a71519\u2019s heading,\nseeante, at 10 (\u201cWe note first \u00a71519\u2019s caption\u201d), I would\nbegin with \u00a71519\u2019s text. When Congress has not supplied a\ndefinition, we generally give a statutory term its ordinary\nmeaning. See,e.g.,Schindler Elevator Corp.v.United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 5). As the plurality must acknowledge, the ordinary meaning\nof \u201ctangible object\u201d is \u201ca discrete thing that possesses physical\nform.\u201dAnte, at 7 (punctuation and citation omitted). A fish\nis, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form. See\ngenerally Dr. Seuss, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960).\nSo the ordinary meaning of the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in \u00a71519, as\nnoone here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red\ngrouper).That interpretation accords with endless uses of the term in\nstatute and rule books as construed by courts. Dozens of federal\nlaws and rules of procedure (and hundreds of state enactments)\ninclude the term \u201ctangible object\u201d or its first cousin \u201ctangible\nthing\u201d\u2014some in association with documents, others not. See,e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a78302(2) (referring to \u201cany material or\ntangible object that could harbor a pest or disease\u201d);15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a757b\u20131(c) (authorizing investigative demands for\n\u201cdocumentary material or tangible things\u201d);18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7668(a)(1)(D) (defining \u201cmuseum\u201d as entity that owns \u201ctangible\nobjects that are exhibited to the public\u201d);28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72507(b) (allowing discovery of \u201crelevant facts, books, papers,\ndocuments or tangible things\u201d).[1] To my\nknowledge, no court has ever read any such provision to exclude\nthings that don\u2019t record or preserve data; rather, all courts have\nadhered to the statutory language\u2019s ordinary (i.e.,\nexpansive) meaning. For example, courts have understood the phrases\n\u201ctangible objects\u201d and \u201ctangible things\u201d in the Federal Rules of\nCriminal and Civil Procedure to cover everything from guns to drugs\nto machinery to .\u00a0.\u00a0. animals. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Obiukwu, 17 F.\u00a03d 816, 819 (CA6\n1994) (per curiam) (handgun);United Statesv.Acarino, 270 F. Supp. 526, 527\u2013528 (EDNY 1967) (heroin);In re Newman, 782 F. 2d 971, 972\u2013975 (CA Fed. 1986) (energy\ngeneration system);Martinv.Reynolds Metals Corp.,\n297 F. 2d 49, 56\u201357 (CA9 1961) (cattle). No surprise, then,\nthat\u2014until today\u2014courts have uniformly applied the term \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d in \u00a71519 in the same way. See,e.g.,United\nStatesv.McRae, 702 F. 3d 806, 834\u2013838 (CA5 2012)\n(corpse);UnitedStatesv.Maury, 695 F. 3d\n227, 243\u2013244 (CA3 2012) (cement mixer).That is not necessarily the end of the matter; I agree with the\nplurality (really, who does not?) that context matters in\ninterpreting statutes. We do not \u201cconstrue the meaning of statutory\nterms in a vacuum.\u201dTylerv.Cain,533 U.\u00a0S.\n656,662 (2001). Rather, we interpret particular words \u201cin their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme.\u201dDavisv.Michigan Dept. of Treasury,489\nU.\u00a0S. 803,809 (1989). And sometimes that means, as the\nplurality says, that the dictionary definition of a disputed term\ncannot control. See,e.g.,Bloatev.United\nStates, 559 U.\u00a0S. 196, n.\u00a09 (2010). But this is not\nsuch an occasion, for here the text and its context point the same\nway. Stepping back from the words \u201ctangible object\u201d provides only\nfurther evidence that Congress said what it meant and meant what it\nsaid.Begin with the way the surrounding words in \u00a71519 reinforce the\nbreadth of the term at issue. Section 1519 refers to \u201cany\u201d tangible\nobject, thus indicating (in line withthatword\u2019s plain\nmeaning) a tangible object \u201cof whatever kind.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 97 (2002). This Court has time and again\nrecognized that \u201cany\u201d has \u201can expansive meaning,\u201d bringing within a\nstatute\u2019s reachalltypes of the item (here, \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d) to which the law refers.Department of Housing and\nUrban Developmentv.Rucker,535 U. S. 125,131 (2002);\nsee,e.g.,Republic of Iraqv.Beaty,556 U. S.\n848,856 (2009);Aliv.Federal Bureau of Prisons,552\nU. S. 214\u2013220 (2008). And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in\n\u00a71519 (\u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\nfalsifies, or makes a false entry\u201d) further shows that Congress\nwrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are supposed to\nensure\u2014just as \u201ctangible object\u201d is meant to\u2014that \u00a71519 covers the\nwhole world of evidence-tampering, in all its prodigious variety.\nSeeUnited Statesv.Rodgers,466 U. S. 475,480 (1984)\n(rejecting a \u201cnarrow, technical definition\u201d of a statutory term\nwhen it \u201cclashes strongly\u201d with \u201csweeping\u201d language in the same\nsentence).Still more, \u201ctangible object\u201d appears as part of a three-noun\nphrase (including also \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d) common to\nevidence-tampering laws and always understood to embrace things of\nall kinds. The Model Penal Code\u2019s evidence-tampering section,\ndrafted more than 50 years ago, similarly prohibits a person from\n\u201calter[ing], destroy[ing], conceal[ing] or remov[ing] anyrecord, document or thing\u201d in an effort to thwart an\nofficial investigation or proceeding. ALI, Model Penal Code\n\u00a7241.7(1),p. 175 (1962) (emphasis added). The Code\u2019s commentary\nemphasizes that the offense described in that provision is \u201cnot\nlimited to conduct that [alters] a written instrument.\u201dId.,\n\u00a7241.7, Comment 3, at 179. Rather, the language extends to \u201cany\nphysical object.\u201dIbid.Consistent with that statement\u2014and,\nof course, with ordinary meaning\u2014courts in the more than 15 States\nthat have laws based on the Model Code\u2019s tampering provision apply\nthem to all tangible objects, including drugs, guns, vehicles and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. yes, animals. See,e.g.,Statev.Majors, 318 S. W. 3d 850, 859\u2013861 (Tenn. 2010) (cocaine);Puckettv.State, 328 Ark. 355, 357\u2013360, 944 S. W. 2d\n111, 113\u2013114 (1997) (gun);Statev.Bruno, 236 Conn.\n514, 519\u2013520, 673 A. 2d 1117, 1122\u20131123 (1996) (bicycle, skeleton,\nblood stains);Statev.Crites, 2007 Mont. Dist.\nLEXIS 615, *5\u2013*7 (Dec. 21, 2007) (deer antlers). Not a one has\nlimited the phrase\u2019s scope to objects that record or preserve\ninformation.The words \u201crecord, document, or tangible object\u201d in \u00a71519 also\ntrack language in18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71512, the federal\nwitness-tampering law covering (as even the plurality accepts, seeante, at 12) physical evidence in all its forms. Section\n1512, both in its original version (preceding \u00a71519) and today,\nrepeatedly uses the phrase \u201crecord, document, or other object\u201d\u2014most\nnotably, in a provision prohibiting the use of force or threat to\ninduce another person to withhold any of those materials from an\nofficial proceeding. \u00a74(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act\nof 1982,96Stat.1249, as amended,18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71512(b)(2).\nThat language, which itself likely derived from the Model Penal\nCode, encompasses no less the bloody knife than the incriminating\nletter, as all courts have for decades agreed. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Kellington, 217 F. 3d 1084, 1088\n(CA9 2000) (boat);United Statesv.Applewhaite, 195\nF. 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999) (stone wall). And typically \u201conly the\nmost compelling evidence\u201d will persuade this Court that Congress\nintended \u201cnearly identical language\u201d in provisions dealing with\nrelated subjects to bear different meanings.Communication\nWorkersv.Beck,487 U.\u00a0S. 735,754 (1988); see A.\nScalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal\nTexts 252 (2012). Context thus again confirms what text\nindicates.And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts extra\nicing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the plurality\nnotes, seeante, at 2, 6, was enacted after the Enron\nCorporation\u2019s collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002,116Stat.745. But the provision began its life in a separate\nbill, and the drafters emphasized that Enron was \u201conly a case study\nexposing the shortcomings in our current laws\u201d relating to both\n\u201ccorporate and criminal\u201d fraud. S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, pp.\u00a02, 11\n(2002). The primary \u201cloophole[\u00a0]\u201d Congress identified, seeid., at 14, arose from limits in the part of \u00a71512 just\ndescribed: That provision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a\nperson from inducing another to destroy \u201crecord[s], document[s], or\nother object[s]\u201d\u2014of every type\u2014but not from doing so himself.\n\u00a71512(b)(2); seesupra, at 5. Congress (as even the\nplurality agrees, seeante, at 6) enacted \u00a71519 to close\nthat yawning gap. But \u00a71519 could fully achieve that goal only if\nit covered all the records, documents, and objects \u00a71512 did, as\nwell as all the means of tampering with them. And so \u00a71519 was\nwritten to do exactly that\u2014\u201cto apply broadly to any acts to destroy\nor fabricate physical evidence,\u201d as long as performed with the\nrequisite intent. S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, at 14. \u201cWhen a person\ndestroys evidence,\u201d the drafters explained, \u201coverly technical legal\ndistinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution.\u201dId., at 7. Ah well: Congress, meet today\u2019s Court, which here\ninvents just such a distinction with just such an effect. SeeUnited Statesv.Philadelphia Nat. Bank,374\nU.\u00a0S. 321,343 (1963) (\u201c[C]reat[ing] a large loophole in a\nstatute designed to close a loophole\u201d is \u201cillogical and\ndisrespectful of .\u00a0.\u00a0. congressional purpose\u201d).As Congress recognized in using a broad term, giving immunity to\nthose who destroy non-documentary evidence has no sensible basis in\npenal policy. A person who hides a murder victim\u2019s body is no less\nculpable than one who burns the victim\u2019s diary. A fisherman, like\nJohn Yates, who dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less\nblameworthy than one who shreds his vessel\u2019s catch logfor the same\nreason. Congress thus treated both offenders in the same way. It\nunderstood, in enacting \u00a71519, that destroying evidence is\ndestroying evidence, whether or not that evidence takes documentary\nform.IIAThe plurality searches far and wide for\nanything\u2014anything\u2014to support its interpretation of \u00a71519.\nBut its fishing expedition comes up empty.The plurality\u2019s analysis starts with \u00a71519\u2019s title:\n\u201cDestruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal\ninvestigations and bankruptcy.\u201d Seeante, at 10; see alsoante, at 3\u20134 (opinion of Alito, J.). That\u2019s already a sign\nsomething is amiss. I know of no other case in which we havebegunour interpretation of a statute with the title, or\nrelied on a title to override the law\u2019s clear terms. Instead, we\nhave followed \u201cthe wise rule that the title of a statute and the\nheading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.\u201dTrainmenv.Baltimore & Ohio R.\u00a0Co.,331 U.\nS. 519\u2013529 (1947).The reason for that \u201cwise rule\u201d is easy to see: A title is,\nalmost necessarily, an abridgment. Attempting to mention every term\nin a statute \u201cwould often be ungainly as well as useless\u201d;\naccordingly, \u201cmatters in the text .\u00a0.\u00a0. are frequently\nunreflected in the headings.\u201dId., at 528. Just last year,\nthis Court observed that two titles in a nearby section of\nSarbanes-Oxley serve as \u201cbut a short-hand reference to the general\nsubject matter\u201d of the provision at issue, \u201cnot meant to take the\nplace of the detailed provisions of the text.\u201dLawsonv.FMR LLC, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 16)\n(quotingTrainmen, 331 U.\u00a0S., at 528). The\n\u201cunder-inclusiveness\u201d of the headings, we stated, was \u201capparent.\u201dLawson, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at16). So too for\n\u00a71519\u2019s title, which refers to \u201cdestruction, alteration, or\nfalsification\u201d butnotto mutilation, concealment, or\ncovering up, and likewise mentions \u201crecords\u201d butnotother\ndocuments or objects. Presumably, the plurality would not refuse to\napply \u00a71519 when a person only conceals evidence rather than\ndestroying, altering, or falsifying it; instead, the plurality\nwould say that a title is just a title, which cannot \u201cundo or\nlimit\u201d more specific statutory text.Ibid.(quotingTrainmen, 331 U.\u00a0S., at 529). The same holds true when\nthe evidence in question is not a \u201crecord\u201d but something else whose\ndestruction, alteration, etc., is intended to obstruct justice.The plurality next tries to divine meaning from \u00a71519\u2019s\n\u201cposition within Chapter 73 of Title 18.\u201dAnte, at 10. But\nthat move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell, this\nCourt has never once suggested that the section number assigned to\na law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,supra, at xi\u2013xvi\n(listing more than 50 interpretive principles and canons without\nmentioning the plurality\u2019s new number-in-the-Code theory). And even\non its own terms, the plurality\u2019s argument is hard to fathom. The\nplurality claims that if \u00a71519 applied to objects generally,\nCongress would not have placed it \u201cafter the pre-existing \u00a71516,\n\u00a71517, and \u00a71518\u201d because those are \u201cspecialized provisions.\u201dAnte, at 11. But search me if I can find a better place for\na broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plural-ity seems to agree\nthat the law properly goes in Chapter 73\u2014the criminal code\u2019s\nchapter on \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d But the provision does not\nlogically fit into any of that chapter\u2019s pre-existing sections. And\nwith the first 18 numbers of the chapter already taken (starting\nwith \u00a71501 and continuing through \u00a71518), the law naturally took\nthe 19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior to the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was ordered\nchronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted than \u00a71517, which\nwas later enacted than \u00a71516, which was .\u00a0.\u00a0. well, you\nget the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress has continued in\nthe same vein. Section 1519 is thus right where you would expect it\n(as is the contemporaneously passed \u00a71520)\u2014between \u00a71518 (added in\n1996) and \u00a71521 (added in 2008).[2]The plurality\u2019s third argument, relying on the surplusage canon,\nat least invokes a known tool of statutory construction\u2014but it too\ncomes to nothing. Says the plurality: If read naturally, \u00a71519\n\u201cwould render superfluous\u201d \u00a71512(c)(1), which Congress passed \u201cas\npart of the same act.\u201dAnte, at 13. But that is not so:\nAlthough the two provisions significantly overlap, each applies to\nconduct the other does not. The key difference between the two is\nthat \u00a71519 protects the integrity of \u201cmatter[s] within the\njurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency\u201d whereas\n\u00a71512(c)(1) safeguards \u201cofficial proceeding[s]\u201d as definedin\n\u00a71515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519\u2019s language often applies more broadly\nthan \u00a71512(c)(1)\u2019s, as the plurality notes. For example, an FBI\ninvestigation counts as a matter within a federal department\u2019s\njurisdiction, but falls outside the statutory definition of\n\u201cofficial proceeding\u201d as construed by courts. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Gabriel, 125 F. 3d 89, 105, n. 13\n(CA2 1997). But conversely, \u00a71512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more\nwidely than \u00a71519. For example, because an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d\nincludes any \u201cproceeding before a judge or court of the United\nStates,\u201d \u00a71512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal\nlitigation between private parties. See \u00a71515(a)(1)(A);United\nStatesv.Burge, 711 F.\u00a03d 803, 808\u2013810 (CA7 2013);United Statesv.Reich, 479 F.\u00a03d 179, 185\u2013187\n(CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.). By contrast, \u00a71519 wouldn\u2019t ordinarily\noperate in that context because a federal court isn\u2019t a \u201cdepartment\nor agency.\u201d SeeHubbardv.United States,514\nU.\u00a0S. 695,715 (1995).[3] So the surplusage\ncanon doesn\u2019t come into play.[4] Overlap\u2014even\nsignificant overlap\u2014abounds in the criminal law. SeeLoughrinv.United States, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ \u2013\n___, n.\u00a04 (2014) (slip op., at 6\u20137, n.\u00a04). This Court has\nnever thought that of such ordinary stuff surplusage is made. Seeibid.;Connecticut Nat. Bankv.Germain,503\nU.\u00a0S. 249,253 (1992).And the legislative history to which the plurality appeals, seeante, at 6, only cuts against it because those materials\nshow that lawmakers knew that \u00a71519 and \u00a71512(c)(1) share much\ncommon ground. Minority Leader Lott introduced the amendment that\nincluded \u00a71512(c)(1) (along with other criminal and corporate fraud\nprovisions) late in the legislative process, explaining that he did\nso at the specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec.\n12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott but\nseveral other Senators noted the overlap between the President\u2019s\npackage and provisions already in the bill, most notably \u00a71519. Seeid., at 12512 (remarks of Sen. Lott);id., at 12513\n(remarks of Sen. Biden);id., at 12517 (remarks of Sens.\nHatch and Gramm). The presence of both \u00a71519 and \u00a71512(c)(1) in the\nfinal Act may have reflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If \u00a71519\ncontained some flaw, \u00a71512(c)(1) would serve as a backstop. Or the\naddition of \u00a71512(c)(1) may have derived solely from legislators\u2019\nwish \u201cto satisfy audiences other than courts\u201d\u2014that is, the\nPresident and his Justice Department. Gluck & Bressman,\nStatutory Interpretation from the Inside, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 935\n(2013) (emphasis deleted). Whichever the case, Congress\u2019s\nconsciousness of overlap between the two provisions removes any\nconceivable reason to cast aside \u00a71519\u2019s ordinary meaning in\nservice of preventing some statutory repetition.Indeed, the inclusion of \u00a71512(c)(1) in Sarbanes-Oxley creates a\nfar worse problem for the plurality\u2019s construction of \u00a71519 than\nfor mine. Section 1512(c)(1) criminalizes the destruction of any\n\u201crecord, document, or other object\u201d; \u00a71519 of any \u201crecord,\ndocument, or tangible object.\u201d On the plurality\u2019s view, one\n\u201cobject\u201d is really an object, whereas the other is only an object\nthat preserves or stores information. But \u201c[t]he normal rule of\nstatutory construction assumes that identical words used in\ndifferent parts of the same act,\u201d passed at the same time, \u201care\nintended to have the same meaning.\u201dSorensonv.Secretary\nof Treasury,475 U.\u00a0S. 851,860 (1986) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And that is especially true when the different\nprovisions pertain to the same subject. Seesupra, at 5\u20136.\nThe plurality doesn\u2019t\u2014really, can\u2019t\u2014explain why it instead\ninterprets the same words used in two provisions of the same Act\naddressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different\nthings.Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches canons,\nhoping thatnoscitur a sociisandejusdem generiswill save it. Seeante, at 13\u201316; see alsoante, at\n1\u20132 (opinion of Alito, J.). The first of those related canons\nadvises that words grouped in a list be given similar meanings. The\nsecond counsels that a general term following specific words\nembraces only things of a similar kind. According to the plurality,\nthose Latin maxims change the English meaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d\nto only things, like records and documents, \u201cused to record or\npreserve information.\u201dAnte, at 14.[5] But\nunderstood as this Court always has, the canons have no such\ntransformative effect on the workaday language Congress chose.As an initial matter, this Court usesnoscitur a sociisandejusdem generisto resolve ambiguity, not create it.\nThose principles are \u201cuseful rule[s] of construction where words\nare of obscure or doubtful meaning.\u201dRussell Motor Car Co.v.United States,261 U. S. 514,520 (1923). But when words\nhave a clear definition, and all other contextual clues support\nthat meaning, the canons cannot properly defeat Congress\u2019s decision\nto draft broad legislation. See,e.g.,Ali, 552\nU.\u00a0S., at 227 (rejecting the invocation of these canons as an\n\u201cattempt to create ambiguity where the statute\u2019s text and structure\nsuggest none\u201d).Anyway, assigning \u201ctangible object\u201d its ordinary meaning\ncomports withnoscitur a sociisandejusdem generiswhen applied, as they should be, with attention to \u00a71519\u2019s subject\nand purpose. Those canons require identifying a common trait that\nlinks all the words in a statutory phrase. See,e.g.,Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist.v.United\nStates ex rel. Wilson,559 U.\u00a0S. 280,289, n.7 (2010);Ali, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 224\u2013226. In responding to that\ndemand, the plurality characterizes records and documents as things\nthat preserve information\u2014and so they are. But just as much, they\nare things that provide information, and thus potentially serve as\nevidence relevant to matters under review. And in a statute\npertaining to obstruction of federal investigations, that\nevidentiary function comes to the fore. The destruction of records\nand documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts\nrelevant to official inquiries. And so too does the destruction of\ntangible objects\u2014of whatever kind. Whether the item is a\nfisherman\u2019s ledger or an undersized fish, throwing it overboard has\nthe identical effect on the administration of justice. Seesupra, at 7. For purposes of \u00a71519, records, documents, and\n(all) tangible objects are therefore alike.Indeed, even the plurality can\u2019t fully credit itsnoscitur/ejusdemargument. The same reasoning would\napply toeverylaw placing the word \u201cobject\u201d (or \u201cthing\u201d)\nafter \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument.\u201d But as noted earlier, such statutes\nare common: The phrase appears (among other places) in many state\nlaws based on the Model Penal Code, as well as in multiple\nprovisions of \u00a71512. Seesupra, at 4\u20135. The plurality\naccepts that in those laws \u201cobject\u201d means object; its argument\nabout superfluity positivelydependson giving \u00a71512(c)(1)\nthat broader reading. Seeante, at 13, 16. What, then, is\nthe difference here? The plurality proposes that some of those\nstatutes describe less serious offenses than \u00a71519. Seeante, at 17. How and why that distinction affects\napplication of thenoscitur a sociisandejusdem\ngeneriscanons is left obscure: Count it asone more of the\nplurality\u2019s never-before-propounded,not-readily-explained\ninterpretive theories. Seesupra, at 7, 8\u20139, 11\u201312. But in\nany event, that rationale cannot support the plurality\u2019s\nwillingness to give \u201cobject\u201d its natural meaning in \u00a71512, which\n(like \u00a71519) sets out felonies with penalties of up to 20 years.\nSee \u00a7\u00a71512(a)(3)(C), (b), (c). The canons, in the plurality\u2019s\ninterpretive world, apparently switch on and off whenever\nconvenient.And the plurality\u2019s invocation of \u00a71519\u2019s verbs does nothing to\nbuttress its canon-based argument. Seeante, at 14\u201315;ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion of Alito, J.). The plurality observes\nthat \u00a71519 prohibits \u201cfalsif[ying]\u201d or \u201cmak[ing] a false entry in\u201d\na tangible object, and no one can do those things to, say, a murder\nweapon (or a fish).Ante, at 14. But of course someone can\nalter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, or cover up such a tangible\nobject, and \u00a71519 prohibits those actions too. The Court has never\nbefore suggested that all the verbs in a statute need to match up\nwith all the nouns. SeeRobersv.United States, 572\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he law does not\nrequire legislators to write extra language specifically exempting,\nphrase by phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a\nphrase is not needed\u201d). And for good reason. It is exactly when\nCongress sets out to draft a statute broadly\u2014to include every\nimaginable variation on a theme\u2014that such mismatches will arise. To\nrespond by narrowing the law, as the plurality does, is thus to\nflout both what Congress wrote and what Congress wanted.Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the rule of\nlenity. Seeante, at 18. But even in its most robust form,\nthat rule only kicks in when, \u201cafter all legitimate tools of\ninterpretation have been exhausted, \u2018a reasonable doubt persists\u2019\nregarding whether Congress has made the defendant\u2019s conduct a\nfederal crime.\u201dAbramskiv.United States, 573\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia,\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 12) (quotingMoskalv.United States,498\nU.\u00a0S. 103,108 (1990)). No such doubt lingers here. The\nplural-ity points to the breadth of \u00a71519, seeante, at 18,\nas though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not. Section\n1519isvery broad. It is also very clear. Every traditional\ntool of statutory interpretation points in the same direction,\ntoward \u201cobject\u201d meaning object. Lenity offers no proper refuge from\nthat straightforward (even though capacious) construction.[6]BThe concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of the\nplurality\u2019s. It relies primarily on thenoscitur a sociisandejusdem generiscanons, tries to bolster them with\n\u00a71519\u2019s \u201clist of verbs,\u201d and concludes with the section\u2019s title.\nSeesupra, at 7\u20138, 12\u201313, 14\u201315 (addressing each of those\narguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no stock in the\nplurality\u2019s section-number and superfluity claims.) From those\nfamiliar materials, the concurrence arrives at the following\ndefinition: \u201c\u00a0\u2018tangible object\u2019 should mean something similar\nto records or documents.\u201dAnte, at 4 (opinion of Alito, J.).\nIn amplifying that purported guidance, the concurrence suggests\napplying the term \u201ctangible object\u201d in keeping with what \u201ca\nneighbor, when asked to identify something similar to record or\ndocument,\u201d might answer.Ante, at 1. \u201c[W]ho wouldn\u2019t raise\nan eyebrow,\u201d the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said\n\u201ccrocodile\u201d?Ante, at 1\u20132. Courts sometimes say, when\nexplaining the Latin maxims, that the \u201cwords of a statute should be\ninterpreted consistent with their neighbors.\u201d See,e.g.,United Statesv.Locke, 529 U.\u00a0S. 89,105 (2000).\nThe concurrence takes that expression literally.But \u00a71519\u2019s meaning should not hinge on the odd game of Mad Libs\nthe concurrence proposes. No one reading \u00a71519 needs to fill in a\nblank after the words \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments.\u201d That is because\nCongress, quite helpfully, already did so\u2014adding the term \u201ctangible\nobject.\u201d The issue in this case is what that term means. So if the\nconcurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I\u2019d recommend a\nmore pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the concurrence\nprefers, a crocodile) is a \u201ctangible object\u201d? As to that query,\n\u201cwho wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow\u201d if the neighbor said \u201cno\u201d?In insisting on its different question, the concurrence neglects\nthe proper function of catchall phrases like \u201cor tangible object.\u201d\nThe reason Congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things\nthat, in the concurrence\u2019s words, \u201cdo[\u00a0] not spring to\nmind\u201d\u2014to my mind, to my neighbor\u2019s, or (most important) to\nCongress\u2019s.Ante, at 1 (opinion of Alito, J.). As this Court\nrecently explained: \u201c[T]he whole value of a generally phrased\nresidual [term] is that it serves as a catchall for matters not\nspecifically contemplated\u2014known unknowns.\u201dBeaty, 556\nU.\u00a0S., at 860. Congress realizes that in a game of free\nassociation with \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cdocument,\u201d it will never think of\nall the other things\u2014including crocodiles and fish\u2014whose\ndestruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as\neffectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf.United Statesv.Stubbs, 11 F.\u00a03d 632, 637\u2013638 (CA6 1993) (dead\ncrocodiles used as evidence to support smuggling conviction). And\nso Congress adds the general term \u201cor tangible object\u201d\u2014again,\nexactly because such things \u201cdo[\u00a0] not spring to\nmind.\u201d[7]The concurrence suggests that the term \u201ctangible object\u201d serves\nnot as a catchall for physical evidence but to \u201censure beyond\nquestion\u201d that e-mails and other electronic files fall within\n\u00a71519\u2019s compass.Ante, at 2. But that claim is\neyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Congress wishing to make\ncertain that \u00a71519 applies toe-mails add the phrase \u201ctangible\nobject\u201d (as opposed, say, to \u201celectronic communications\u201d)? Would a\njudge or jury member predictably find that \u201ctangible object\u201d\nencompasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say, with\nsomething as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer is not), then\nthat term cannot function as a failsafe fore-mails.The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its arguments can\ncarry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons plus \u00a71519\u2019s verbs\nplus \u00a71519\u2019s title to \u201ctip the case\u201d for Yates.Ante, at 1.\nBut the sum total of three mistaken arguments is .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthree mistaken arguments. They do not get better in the combining.\nAnd so the concurrence ends up right where the plurality does,\nexcept that the concurrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has\nnothing to fallback on.IIIIf none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation can\nproduce today\u2019s result, then what accounts for it? The plurality\noffers a clue when it emphasizes the disproportionate penalties\n\u00a71519 imposes if the law is read broadly. Seeante, at\n17\u201318. Section 1519, the plurality objects, would then\n\u201cexpose[\u00a0] individuals to 20-year prison sentences for\ntampering withanyphysical object thatmighthave\nevidentiary value inanyfederal investigation intoanyoffense.\u201dAnte, at 18. That brings to the surface\nthe real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punishment in the\nU.\u00a0S. Code.Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat\u2014though\nonly somewhat\u2014exaggerates the matter. The plurality omits from its\ndescription of \u00a71519 the requirement that a person act \u201cknowingly\u201d\nand with \u201cthe intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\u201d federal law\nenforcement. And in highlighting \u00a71519\u2019s maximum penalty, the\nplurality glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.\n(Let\u2019s not forget that Yates\u2019s sentence was not 20 years, but 30\ndays.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no\nminimums when it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut\nfrom major to minor. Thatis assuredly true of acts obstructing\njustice. Compare this case with the following, all of which\nproperly come within, but now fall outside, \u00a71519:McRae,\n702 F.\u00a03d, at 834\u2013838 (burning human body to thwart murder\ninvestigation);Maury, 695 F.\u00a03d, at 243\u2013244 (altering\ncement mixer to impede inquiry into amputation of employee\u2019s\nfingers);United Statesv.Natal, 2014 U. S. Dist.\nLEXIS 108852, *24\u2013*26 (D Conn., Aug. 7, 2014) (repainting van to\ncover up evidence of fatal arson). Most district judges, as\nCongress knows, will recognize differences between such cases and\nprosecutions like this one, and will try to make the punishment fit\nthe crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for the reasons the\nplurality gives, that \u00a71519 is a bad law\u2014too broad and\nundifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give\nprosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion.\nAnd I\u2019d go further: In those ways, \u00a71519 is unfortunately not an\noutlier, but an emblem of a deeper pathology in the federal\ncriminal code.But whatever the wisdom or folly of \u00a71519, this Court does not\nget to rewrite the law. \u201cResolution of the pros and cons of whether\na statute should sweep broadly or narrowly is for Congress.\u201dRodgers, 466 U. S., at 484. If judges disagree with\nCongress\u2019s choice, we are perfectly entitled to say so\u2014in lectures,\nin law review articles, and even in dicta. But we are not entitled\nto replace the statute Congress enacted with an alternative of our\nowndesign.I respectfully dissent.Notes1From Alabama and Alaska through\nWisconsin and Wyoming (and trust me\u2014in all that come between),\nStates similarly use the terms \u201ctangible objects\u201d and \u201ctangible\nthings\u201d in statutes and rules of all sorts. See,e.g., Ala.\nCode \u00a734\u201317\u20131(3) (2010) (defining \u201clandscape architecture\u201d to\ninclude the design of certain \u201ctangible objects and features\u201d);\nAlaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1) (2014) (allowing litigants to\n\u201cinspect, copy, test, or sample any tangible things\u201d that\nconstitute or contain discoverable material); Wis. Stat. \u00a7804.09(1)\n(2014) (requiring the production of \u201cdesignated tangible things\u201d in\ncivil proceedings); Wyo. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(h) (2014) (defining\n\u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of a search-and-seizure statute to include\n\u201cdocuments, books, papers and any other tangible\nobjects\u201d).2The lonesome exception to Chapter\n73\u2019s chronological order is \u00a71514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to\ncreate a civil action to protect whistleblowers. Congress decided\nto place that provision right after the only other section in\nChapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to protect victims\nand witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the \u00a71514 example, says\nit likewise \u201cwould have made more sense for Congress to codify the\nsubstance of \u00a71519 within \u00a71512 or in a new \u00a71512A.\u201dAnte,\nat 12, n. 4. But \u00a71512 is titled \u201cTampering with a witness, victim,\nor an informant,\u201d and its provisions almost all protect witnesses\nfrom intimidation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that\nCongress wanted a broad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its\nown rather than as part of\u2014or an appendage to\u2014a witness-tampering\nprovision.3The plurality\u2019s objection to this\nstatement is difficult to understand. It cannot take issue withHubbard\u2019s holding that \u201ca federal court is neither a\n\u2018department\u2019 nor an \u2018agency\u2019\u00a0\u201d in a statute referring, just as\n\u00a71519 does, to \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of any\ndepartment or agency of the United States.\u201d 514 U.\u00a0S., at 698,\n715. So the plurality suggests that the phrase \u201cin relation to\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. any such matter\u201d in \u00a71519 somehow changesHubbard\u2019s result. Seeante, at 12\u201313, and n.\u00a05.\nBut that phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a\n\u201cmatter within the jurisdiction of any department or\nagency\u201d\u2014excluding courts, asHubbardcommands. That is why\nthe federal government, as far asI can tell, has never once brought\na prosecution under \u00a71519 forevidence-tampering in litigation\nbetween private parties. It instead uses \u00a71512(c)(1) for that\npurpose.4Section 1512(c)(1) also applies more\nbroadly than \u00a71519 in proceedings relating to insurance regulation.\nThe term \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d in \u00a71512(c)(1) is defined to include\n\u201cproceeding[s] involving the business of insurance whose activities\naffect interstate commerce before any insurance regulatory official\nor agency.\u201d \u00a71515(a)(1)(D). But \u00a71519 wouldn\u2019t usually apply in\nthat context because state, not federal, agencies handle most\ninsurance regulation.5The plurality seeks support for this\nargument in the Sentencing Commission\u2019s construction of the phrase\n\u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects,\u201dante, at 14, but\nto no avail. The plurality cites a note in the Commission\u2019s Manual\nclarifying that this phrase, as used in the Sentencing Guidelines,\n\u201cincludes\u201d various electronic information, communications, and\nstorage devices. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual \u00a72J1.2, comment., n.\u00a01 (Nov. 2014) (USSG). But\n\u201cincludes\u201d (following its ordinary definition) \u201cis not exhaustive,\u201d\nas the Commission\u2019s commentary makes explicit. USSG \u00a71B1.1,\ncomment., n.\u00a02. Otherwise, the Commission\u2019s construction\nwouldn\u2019t encompasspaperdocuments. All the note does is to\nmake plain that \u201crecords, documents, or tangible objects\u201d embraces\nstuff relating to the digital (as well as the material)\nworld.6As part of its lenity argument, the\nplurality asserts that Yates did not have \u201cfair warning\u201d that his\nconduct amounted to a felony.Ante, at 18; seeante,\nat 17 (stating that \u201cYates would have had scant reason to\nanticipate a felony prosecution\u201d when throwing fish overboard). But\neven under the plurality\u2019s view, the dumping of fish is potentially\na federal felony\u2014just under \u00a71512(c)(1), rather than \u00a71519. Seeante, at 12\u201313. In any event, the plurality itself\nacknowledges that the ordinary meaning of \u00a71519 covers Yates\u2019s\nconduct, seeante, at 7: That provision, no less than\n\u00a71512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the clearest possible\nterms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a statute\u2019s\nscope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the\nplurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity\nprinciple, and thenosciturandejusdemcanons.7The concurrence contends that when\nthenosciturandejusdemcanons are in play,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018known unknowns\u2019 should be similar to known knowns,i.e., here, records and documents.\u201dAnte, at 2. But\nas noted above, records and documentsaresimilar to\ncrocodiles and fish as far as \u00a71519 is concerned: All are\npotentially useful as evidence in an investigation. Seesupra,at 13. The concurrence never explains whythatsimilarity isn\u2019t the relevant one in a statute aimed at\nevidence-tampering.",
