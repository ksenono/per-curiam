InIn\u00a0re Seagate Technology, LLC, 497 F.\u00a03d\n1360 (2007) (en banc), the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit adopted a two-part test for determining when a\ndistrict court may increase damages pursuant to \u00a7284. UnderSeagate, a patent owner must first \u201cshow by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively\nhigh likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a\nvalid patent.\u201dId., at 1371. Second, the patentee must\ndemonstrate, again by clear and convincing evidence, that the risk\nof infringement \u201cwas either known or so obvious that it should have\nbeen known to the accused infringer.\u201dIbid.The question\nbefore us is whether this test is consistent with \u00a7284. We hold\nthat it is not.IAEnhanced damages are as old as U.\u00a0S.\npatent law. The Patent Act of 1793 mandated treble damages in any\nsuccessful infringement suit. See Patent Act of 1793, \u00a75, 1Stat.\n322. In the Patent Act of 1836, however, Congress changed course\nand made enhanced damages discretionary, specifying that \u201cit shall\nbe in the power of the court to render judgment for any sum above\nthe amount found by [the] verdict .\u00a0.\u00a0. not exceeding\nthree times the amount thereof, according to the circumstances of\nthe case.\u201d Pat-ent Act of 1836, \u00a714, 5Stat. 123. In construing that\nnew provision, this Court explained that the change was prompted by\nthe \u201cinjustice\u201d of subjecting a \u201cdefendant who acted in ignorance\nor good faith\u201d to the same treatment as the \u201cwanton and malicious\npirate.\u201dSeymourv.McCormick, 16 How. 480, 488\n(1854). There \u201cis no good reason,\u201d we observed, \u201cwhy taking a man\u2019s\nproperty in an invention should be trebly punished, while the\nmeasure of damages as to other property is single and actual\ndamages.\u201dId., at 488\u2013489. But \u201cwhere the injury is wanton\nor malicious, a jury may inflict vindictive or exemplary damages,\nnot to recompense the plaintiff, but to punish the defendant.\u201dId., at 489.The Court followed the same approach in other\ndecisions applying the 1836 Act, finding enhanced damages\nappropriate, for instance, \u201cwhere the wrong [had] been done, under\naggravated circumstances,\u201dDeanv.Mason, 20 How.\n198, 203 (1858), but not where the defendant \u201cappeared in truth to\nbe ignorant of the existence of the patent right, and did not\nintend any infringement,\u201dHoggv.Emerson, 11 How.\n587, 607 (1850). See alsoLivingstonv.Woodworth, 15\nHow. 546, 560 (1854) (\u201cno ground\u201d to inflict \u201cpenalty\u201d where\ninfringers were not \u201cwanton\u201d).In 1870, Congress amended the Patent Act, but\npreserved district court discretion to award up to treble damages\n\u201caccording to the circumstances of the case.\u201d Patent Act of 1870,\n\u00a759, 16Stat. 207. We continued to describe enhanced damages as\n\u201cvindictive or punitive,\u201d which the court may \u201cinflict\u201d when \u201cthe\ncircumstances of the case appear to require it.\u201dTilghmanv.Proctor, 125 U.\u00a0S. 136 \u2013144 (1888);Topliffv.Topliff, 145 U.\u00a0S. 156, 174 (1892) (infringer knowingly\nsold copied technology of his former employer). At the same time,\nwe reiterated that there was no basis for increased damages where\n\u201c[t]here is no pretence of any wanton and wilful breach\u201d and\n\u201cnothing that suggests punitive damages, or that shows wherein the\ndefendant was damnified other than by the loss of the profits which\nthe plaintiff received.\u201dCincinnati Siemens-Lungren Gas\nIlluminating Co.v.Western Siemens-Lungren Co., 152\nU.\u00a0S. 200, 204 (1894) .Courts of Appeals likewise characterized\nenhanced damages as justified where the infringer acted\ndeliberately or willfully, see,e.g.,Baseball Display\nCo.v.Star Ballplayer Co., 35 F.\u00a02d 1, 3\u20134 (CA3\n1929) (increased damages award appropriate \u201cbecause of the\ndeliberate and willful infringement\u201d);Power Specialty Co.v.Connecticut Light & Power Co., 80 F.\u00a02d 874, 878\n(CA2 1936) (\u201cwanton, deliberate, and willful\u201d infringement);Brown Bag Filling Mach. Co.v.Drohen, 175 F. 576,\n577 (CA2 1910) (\u201ca bald case of piracy\u201d), but not where the\ninfringement \u201cwas not wanton and deliberate,\u201dRockwoodv.General Fire Extinguisher Co., 37 F.\u00a02d 62, 66 (CA2\n1930), or \u201cconscious and deliberate,\u201dGoodyear Tire & Rubber\nCo.v.Overman Cushion Tire Co., 95 F.\u00a02d 978, 986\n(CA6 1938).Some early decisions did suggest that enhanced\ndam-ages might serve to compensate patentees as well as to punish\ninfringers. See,e.g.,Clarkv.Wooster, 119\nU.\u00a0S. 322, 326 (1886) (noting that \u201c[t]here may be damages\nbeyond\u201d licensing fees \u201cbut these are more properly the subjects\u201d\nof enhanced damage awards). Such statements, however, were not for\nthe ages, in part because the merger of law and equity removed\ncertain procedural obstacles to full compensation absent\nenhancement. See generally 7 Chisum on Patents \u00a720.03[4][b][iii],\npp. 20\u2013343 to 20\u2013344 (2011). In the main, moreover, the references\nto compensation concerned costs attendant to litigation. SeeClark, 119 U.\u00a0S., at 326 (identifying enhanced damages\nas compensation for \u201cthe expense and trouble the plaintiff has been\nput to\u201d);Dayv.Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 372 (1852)\n(enhanced damages appropriate when defendant was \u201cstubbornly\nlitigious\u201d or \u201ccaused unnecessary expense and trouble to the\nplaintiff\u201d);Teesev.Huntingdon, 23 How. 2, 8\u20139\n(1860) (discussing enhanced damages in the context of \u201ccounsel\nfees\u201d). That concern dissipated with the enactment in 1952 of 35\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7285, which authorized district courts to award\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties in \u201cexceptional\ncases\u201d under the Patent Act. SeeOctane Fitness, LLCv.ICON Health & Fitness Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2014) (slip op., at 7).It is against this backdrop that Congress, in\nthe 1952 codification of the Patent Act, enacted \u00a7284. \u201cThe stated\npurpose\u201d of the 1952 revision \u201cwas merely reorganization in\nlanguage to clarify the statement of the statutes.\u201dAro Mfg.\nCo.v.Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.\u00a0S.\n476, 505, n. 20 (1964) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\nCourt accordingly described \u00a7284\u2014consistent with the history of\nenhanced damages under the Patent Act\u2014as providing that \u201cpunitive\nor \u2018increased\u2019 damages\u201d could be recovered \u201cin a case of willful or\nbad-faith infringement.\u201dId.,at 508; see alsoDowlingv.United States, 473 U.\u00a0S. 207 ,\nn.\u00a019 (1985) (\u201cwillful infringement\u201d);Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed.

UnderSeagate, a plaintiff seeking enhanced\ndamages must show that the infringement of his patent was\n\u201cwillful.\u201d 497 F.\u00a03d, at 1368. The Federal Circuit announced a\ntwo-part test to establish such willfulness: First, \u201ca patentee\nmust show by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted\ndespite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted\ninfringement of a valid patent,\u201d without regard to \u201c[t]he state of\nmind of the accused infringer.\u201dId., at 1371.This\nobjectively defined risk is to be \u201cdetermined by the record\ndeveloped in the infringement proceedings.\u201dIbid.\u201cObjective\nrecklessness will not be found\u201d at this first step if the accused\ninfringer, during the infringement proceedings, \u201craise[s] a\n\u2018substantial question\u2019 as to the validity or noninfringement of the\npatent.\u201dBard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.v.W. L. Gore\n& Assoc., Inc., 776 F.\u00a03d 837, 844 (CA Fed. 2015).\nThat categorical bar applies even if the defendant was unaware of\nthe arguable defense when he acted. SeeSeagate, 497\nF.\u00a03d, at 1371;Spine Solutions, Inc.v.Medtronic\nSofamor Danek USA, Inc., 620 F.\u00a03d 1305, 1319 (CA Fed.\n2010).Second, after establishing objective\nrecklessness, a patentee must show\u2014again by clear and convincing\nevidence\u2014that the risk of infringement \u201cwas either known or so\nobvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer.\u201dSeagate, 497 F.\u00a03d, at 1371. Only when both steps have\nbeen satisfied can the district court proceed to consider whether\nto exercise its discretion to award enhanced damages.Ibid.Under Federal Circuit precedent, an award of\nenhanced damages is subject to trifurcated appellate review. The\nfirst step ofSeagate\u2014objective recklessness\u2014is reviewedde\u00a0novo; the second\u2014subjective knowledge\u2014for\nsubstantial evidence; and the ultimate decision\u2014whether to award\nenhanced damages\u2014for abuse of discretion.

Halo alleges that Pulse\ninfringed its patents for electronic packages containing\ntransformers designed to be mounted to the surface of circuit\nboards.Id., at 1374. In 2002, Halo sent Pulse two letters\noffering to license Halo\u2019s patents.Id.,at 1376. After one\nof its engineers concluded that Halo\u2019s patents were invalid, Pulse\ncontinued to sell the allegedly infringing products.Ibid.In 2007, Halo sued Pulse.Ibid.The jury\nfound that Pulse had infringed Halo\u2019s patents, and that there was a\nhigh probability it had done so willfully.Ibid.The\nDistrict Court, however, declined to award enhanced damages under\n\u00a7284, after determining that Pulse had at trial presented a defense\nthat \u201cwas not objectively baseless, or a \u2018sham.\u2019\u00a0\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 14\u20131513, p. 64a (quotingBard, 682\nF.\u00a03d, at 1007). Thus, the court concluded, Halo had failed to\nshow objective recklessness under the first step ofSeagate.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 14\u20131513, at 65a.

The jury found that Zimmer had willfully infringed\nStryker\u2019s patents and awarded Stryker $70 million in lost profits.Ibid.The District Court added $6.1 million in supplemental\ndamages and then trebled the total sum under \u00a7284, resulting in an\naward of over $228 million. App. in No. 14\u20131520, pp. 483\u2013484.Specifically, the District Court noted, the jury\nhad heard testimony that Zimmer had \u201call-but instructed its design\nteam to copy Stryker\u2019s products,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n14\u20131520, at 77a, and had chosen a \u201chigh-risk/high-reward strategy\nof competing immediately and aggressively in the pulsed lavage\nmarket,\u201d while \u201copt[ing] to worry about the potential legal\nconsequences later,\u201did., at 52a. \u201c[T]reble damages [were]\nappropriate,\u201d the District Court concluded, \u201c[g]iven the\none-sidedness of the case and the flagrancy and scope of Zimmer\u2019s\ninfringement.\u201dId., at 119a.The Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment of\ninfringement but vacated the award of treble damages. 782\nF.\u00a03d, at 662. Applyingde\u00a0novoreview, the court\nconcluded that enhanced damages were unavailable because Zimmer had\nasserted \u201creasonable defenses\u201d at trial.Id.,at\n661\u2013662.We granted certiorari in both cases, 577\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), and now vacate and remand.IIAThe pertinent text of \u00a7284 provides simply\nthat \u201cthe court may increase the damages up to three times the\namount found or assessed.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7284. That\nlanguage contains no explicit limit or condition, and we have\nemphasized that the \u201cword \u2018may\u2019 clearly connotes discretion.\u201dMartinv.Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 132,\n136 (2005) (quotingFogertyv.Fantasy, Inc., 510\nU.\u00a0S. 517, 533 (1994) ).At the same time, \u201c[d]iscretion is not whim.\u201dMartin, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 139. \u201c[I]n a system of laws\ndiscretion is rarely without limits,\u201d even when the statute \u201cdoes\nnot specify any limits upon the district courts\u2019 discretion.\u201dFlight Attendantsv.Zipes, 491 U.\u00a0S. 754, 758\n(1989) . \u201c[A] motion to a court\u2019s discretion is a motion, not to\nits inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be\nguided by sound legal principles.\u201dMartin,546 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 139 (quotingUnited Statesv.Burr, 25\nF.\u00a0Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall,\nC.\u00a0J.); alteration omitted). Thus, although there is \u201cno\nprecise rule or formula\u201d for awarding damages under \u00a7284, a\ndistrict court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion should be exercised in light of the\nconsiderations\u201d underlying the grant of that discretion.Octane\nFitness,572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quotingFogerty, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 534).Awards of enhanced damages under the Patent Act\nover the past 180 years establish that they are not to be meted out\nin a typical infringement case, but are instead designed as a\n\u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cvindictive\u201d sanction for egregious infringement\nbehavior. The sort of conduct warranting enhanced damages has been\nvariously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious,\nbad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant,\nor\u2014indeed\u2014characteristic of a pirate. Seesupra,at 2\u20135.\nDistrict courts enjoy discretion in deciding whether to award\nenhanced damages, and in what amount. But through nearly two\ncenturies of discretionary awards and review by appellate\ntribunals, \u201cthe channel of discretion ha[s] narrowed,\u201d Friendly,\nIndiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.\u00a0J. 747, 772 (1982),\nso that such damages are generally reserved for egregious cases of\nculpable behavior.BTheSeagatetest reflects, in many\nrespects, a sound recognition that enhanced damages are generally\nappropriate under \u00a7284 only in egregious cases. That test, however,\n\u201cis unduly rigid, and it impermissibly encumbers the statutory\ngrant of discretion to district courts.\u201dOctane Fitness,572\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (construing \u00a7285 of the Patent\nAct). In particular, it can have the effect of insulating some of\nthe worst patent infringers from any liability for enhanced\ndamages.1The principal problem withSeagate\u2019s\ntwo-part test is that it requires a finding of objective\nrecklessness in every case before district courts may award\nenhanced damages. Such a threshold requirement excludes from\ndiscretionary punishment many of the most culpable offenders, such\nas the \u201cwanton and malicious pirate\u201d who intentionally infringes\nanother\u2019s patent\u2014with no doubts about its validity or any notion of\na defense\u2014for no purpose other than to steal the patentee\u2019s\nbusiness.Seymour, 16 How., at 488. UnderSeagate, a\ndistrict court may not even consider enhanced damages for such a\npirate, unless the court first determines that his infringement was\n\u201cobjectively\u201d reckless. In the context of such deliberate\nwrongdoing, how-ever, it is not clear why an independent showing of\nobjective recklessness\u2014by clear and convincing evidence, no\nless\u2014should be a prerequisite to enhanced damages.Our recent decision inOctane Fitnessarose in a different context but points in the same direction. In\nthat case we considered \u00a7285 of the Patent Act, which allows\ndistrict courts to award attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties in\n\u201cexceptional\u201d cases. 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7285. The Federal\nCircuit had adopted a two-part test for determining when a case\nqualified as exceptional, requiring that the claim asserted be both\nobjectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith. We\nrejected that test on the ground that a case presenting \u201csubjective\nbad faith\u201d alone could \u201csufficiently set itself apart from mine-run\ncases to warrant a fee award.\u201d 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n9). So too here. The subjective willfulness of a patent infringer,\nintentional or knowing, may warrant enhanced damages, without\nregard to whether his infringement was objectively reckless.TheSeagatetest aggravates the problem\nby making dispositive the ability of the infringer to muster a\nreasonable (even though unsuccessful) defense at the infringement\ntrial. The existence of such a defense insulatesthe infringer from\nenhanced damages, even if he did not act on the basis of the\ndefense or was even aware of it. Under that standard, someone who\nplunders a patent\u2014in-fringing it without any reason to suppose his\nconduct is arguably defensible\u2014can nevertheless escape any\ncome-uppance under \u00a7284 solely on the strength of his attorney\u2019s\ningenuity.But culpability is generally measured against\nthe knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged conduct.\nSee generally Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a78A (1965) (\u201cintent\u201d\ndenotes state of mind in which \u201cthe actor desires to cause\nconsequences of his act\u201d or \u201cbelieves\u201d them to be \u201csubstantially\ncertain to result from it\u201d); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &\nD. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a734, p. 212 (5th ed.\n1984) (describing willful, wanton, and reckless as \u201clook[ing] to\nthe actor\u2019s real or supposed state of mind\u201d); see alsoKolstadv.American Dental Assn., 527 U.\u00a0S. 526,\n538 (1999) (\u201cMost often .\u00a0.\u00a0. eligibility for punitive\nawards is characterized in terms of a defendant\u2019s motive or\nintent\u201d). InSafeco Ins. Co. of Americav.Burr, 551\nU.\u00a0S. 47 (2007) , we stated that a person is reckless if he\nacts \u201cknowingorhaving reason to knowof facts which\nwould lead a reasonable man to realize\u201d his actions are\nunreasonably risky.Id., at 69 (emphasis added and internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Court found that the defendant had\nnot recklessly violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act because the\ndefendant\u2019s interpretation had \u201ca foundation in the statutory text\u201d\nand the defendant lacked \u201cthe benefit of guidance from the courts\nof appeals or the Federal Trade Commission\u201d that \u201cmight have warned\nit away from the view it took.\u201dId.,at 69\u201370. Nothing inSafecosuggests that we should look to facts that the\ndefendant neither knew nor had reason to know at the time he\nacted.[1]*Section 284 allows district courts to punish the\nfull range of culpable behavior. Yet none of this is to say that\nenhanced damages must follow a finding of egregious misconduct. As\nwith any exercise of discretion, courts should continue to take\ninto account the particular circumstances of each case in deciding\nwhether to award damages, and in what amount. Section 284 permits\ndistrict courts to exercise their discretion in a manner free from\nthe inelastic constraints of theSeagatetest. Consistent\nwith nearly two centuries of enhanced damages under patent law,\nhowever, such punishment should generally be reserved for egregious\ncases typified by willful misconduct.2TheSeagatetest is also inconsistent\nwith \u00a7284 because it requires clear and convincing evidence to\nprove recklessness. On this pointOctane Fitnessis again\ninstructive. There too the Federal Circuit had adopted a clear and\nconvincing standard of proof, for awards of attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a7285 of the Patent Act. Because that provision supplied no basis\nfor imposing such a heightened standard of proof, we rejected it.\nSeeOctane Fitness,572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11). We do so here as well. Like \u00a7285, \u00a7284 \u201cimposes no specific\nevidentiary burden, much less such a high one.\u201dIbid.And\nthe fact that Congress expressly erected a higher standard of proof\nelsewhere in the Patent Act, see 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7273(b), but\nnot in \u00a7284, is telling. Furthermore, nothing in historical\npractice supports a heightened standard. As we explained inOctane Fitness, \u201cpatent-infringement litigation has always\nbeen governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d 572\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Enhanced damages are no\nexception.3Finally, because we eschew any rigid formula\nfor awarding enhanced damages under \u00a7284, we likewise reject the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s tripartite framework for appellate review. InHighmark Inc.v.Allcare Health Management System,\nInc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), we built on ourOctane\nFitnessholding to reject a similar multipart standard of\nreview. BecauseOctaneFitnessconfirmed district\ncourt discretion to award attorney fees, we concluded that such\ndecisions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.Highmark,572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).The same conclusion follows naturally from our\nholding here. Section 284 gives district courts discretion in\nmeting out enhanced damages. It \u201ccommits the determination\u201d whether\nenhanced damages are appropriate \u201cto the discretion of the district\ncourt\u201d and \u201cthat decision is to be reviewed on appeal for abuse of\ndiscretion.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 4).That standard allows for review of district\ncourt decisions informed by \u201cthe considerations we have\nidentified.\u201dOctane Fitness,572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted). The appellate review\nframework adopted by the Federal Circuit reflects a concern that\ndistrict courts may award enhanced damages too readily, and distort\nthe balance between the protection of patent rights and the\ninterest in technological innovation. Nearly two centuries of\nexercising discretion in awarding enhanced damages in patent cases,\nhowever, has given substance to the notion that there are limits to\nthat discretion. The Federal Circuit should review such exercises\nof discretion in light of the longstanding considerations we have\nidentified as having guided both Congress and the courts.IIIFor their part, respondents argue that\nCongress ratified theSeagatetest when it passed the\nAmerica Invents Act of 2011 and reenacted \u00a7284 without pertinent\nchange. See Brief for Respondents in No. 14\u20131513 27 (citingLorillardv.Pons, 434 U.\u00a0S. 575, 580 (1978) ).\nBut the language Congress reenacted unambiguously confirmed\ndiscretion in the district courts. Congress\u2019s retention of \u00a7284\ncould just as readily reflect an intent that enhanced damages be\nawarded as they had been for nearly two centuries, through the\nexercise of such discretion, informed by settled practices.\nRespondents point to isolated snippets of legislative history\nreferring toSeagateas evidence of congressional\nendorsement of its framework, but other morsels\u2014such as Congress\u2019s\nfailure to adopt a proposed codification similar toSeagate\u2014point in the opposite direction. See,e.g.,\nH.\u00a0R. 1260, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a75(e) (2009).Respondents also seize on an addition to the Act\naddressing opinions of counsel. Section 298 provides that \u201c[t]he\nfailure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel\u201d or \u201cthe\nfailure of the infringer to present such advice to the court or\njury, may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully\ninfringed.\u201d 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7298. Respondents contend that\nthe reference to willfulness reflects an endorsement ofSeagate\u2019s willfulness test. But willfulness has always been\na part of patent law, before and afterSeagate. Section 298\ndoes not show that Congress ratifiedSeagate\u2019s particular\nconception of willfulness. Rather, it simply addressed the fallout\nfrom the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion inUnderwater Devices\nInc.v.Morrison-Knudsen Co., 717 F.\u00a02d 1380\n(1983), which had imposed an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d to obtain advice of\ncounsel prior to initiating any possible infringing activity,id., at 1389\u20131390. See,e.g.,H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n112\u201398, pt. 1, p. 53 (2011).At the end of the day, respondents\u2019 main\nargument for retaining theSeagatetest comes down to a\nmatter of policy. Respondents and theiramiciare concerned\nthat allowing district courts unlimited discretion to award up to\ntreble damages in infringement cases will impede innovation as\ncompanies steer well clear of any possible interference with patent\nrights. They also worry that the ready availability of such damages\nwill embolden \u201ctrolls.\u201d Trolls, in the patois of the patent\ncommunity, are entities that hold patents for the primary purpose\nof enforcing them against alleged infringers, often exacting\noutsized licensing fees on threat of litigation.Respondents are correct that patent law reflects\n\u201ca careful balance between the need to promote innovation\u201d through\npatent protection, and the importance of facilitating the\n\u201cimitation and refinement through imitation\u201d that are \u201cnecessary to\ninvention itself and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy.\u201dBonito Boats, Inc.v.Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489\nU.\u00a0S. 141, 146 (1989) . That balance can indeed be disrupted\nif enhanced damages are awarded in garden-variety cases. As we have\nexplained, however, they should not be. The seriousness of\nrespondents\u2019 policy concerns cannot justify imposing an artificial\nconstruct such as theSeagatetest on the discretion\nconferred under \u00a7284.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Section 284 gives district courts the\ndiscretion to award enhanced damages against those guilty of patent\ninfringement. In applying this discretion, district courts are \u201cto\nbe guided by [the] sound legal principles\u201d developed over nearly\ntwo centuries of application and interpretation of the Patent Act.Martin, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 139 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Those principles channel the exercise of discretion,\nlimiting the award of enhanced damages to egregious cases of\nmisconduct beyond typical infringement. TheSeagatetest, in\ncontrast, unduly confines the ability of district courts to\nexercise the discretion conferred on them. Because both cases\nbefore us were decided under theSeagateframework, we\nvacate the judgments of the Federal Circuit and remand the cases\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0Respondents invoke a\nfootnote inSafecowhere we explained that in considering\nwhether there had been a knowing or reckless violation of the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, a showing of bad faith was not relevant\nabsent a showing of objective recklessness. See 551 U.\u00a0S., at\n70, n. 20. But our precedents make clear that \u201cbad-faith\ninfringement\u201disan independent basis for enhancing patent\ndamages.Aro Mfg.
