Under that doctrine\u2019s terms,\nadministrative agencies must be able to point to \u201c\u00a0\u2018clear\ncongressional authorization\u2019\u00a0\u201d when they claim the power to\nmake decisions of vast \u201c\u00a0\u2018economic and political\nsignificance.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 17, 19. Like many parallel\nclear-statement rules in our law, this one operates to protect\nfoundational constitutional guarantees. I join the Court\u2019s opinion\nand write to offer some additional observations about the doctrine\non which it rests.IAOne of the Judiciary\u2019s most solemn duties is\nto ensure that acts of Congress are applied in accordance with the\nConstitution in the cases that come before us. To help fulfill that\nduty, courts have developed certain \u201cclear-statement\u201d rules. These\nrules assume that, absent a clear statement otherwise, Congress\nmeans for its laws to operate in congruence with the Constitution\nrather than test its bounds. In this way, these clear-statement\nrules help courts \u201cact as faithful agents of the Constitution.\u201d A.\nBarrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B.\u00a0U.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 109, 169 (2010) (Barrett).Consider some examples. The Constitution\nprohibits Congress from passing laws imposing various types of\nretroactive liability. See Art. I, \u00a7 9;Landgrafv.USI\nFilm Products,511 U.S.\n244, 265\u2013266 (1994). Consistent with this rule, Chief Justice\nMarshall long ago advised that \u201ca court .\u00a0.\u00a0. ought to\nstruggle hard against a [statutory] construction which will, by a\nretrospective operation, affect the rights of parties.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Schooner Peggy, 1\u00a0Cranch 103, 110 (1801).\nJustice Paterson likewise insisted that courts must interpret\nstatutes to apply only prospectively \u201cunless they are so clear,\nstrong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be annexed to\nthem.\u201dUnited Statesv.Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 413\n(1806).The Constitution also incorporates the doctrine\nof sovereign immunity. See,e.g.,Hansv.Louisiana,134 U.S.\n1, 12\u201317 (1890). To enforce that doctrine, courts have\nconsistently held that \u201cnothing but express words, or an\ninsurmountable implication\u201d would justify the conclusion that\nlawmakers intended to abrogate the States\u2019 sovereign immunity.Chisholmv.Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 450 (1793)\n(Iredell, J., dissenting); seeSeminole Tribe of Fla.v.Florida,517 U.S.\n44, 55 (1996). In a similar vein, Justice Story observed that\n\u201c[i]t is a general rule in the interpretation of legislative acts\nnot to construe them to embrace the sovereign power or government,\nunless expressly named or included by necessary implication.\u201dUnited Statesv.Greene, 26 F. Cas. 33, 34 (No. 15,\n258) (CC Me. 1827).The major questions doctrine works in much the\nsame way to protect the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.Ante, at 19. In Article I, \u201cthe People\u201d vested \u201c[a]ll\u201d\nfederal \u201clegislative powers .\u00a0.\u00a0. in Congress.\u201d Preamble;\nArt. I, \u00a7\u00a01. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that\n\u201cimportant subjects .\u00a0.\u00a0. must be entirely regulated by\nthe legislature itself,\u201d even if Congress may leave the Executive\n\u201cto act under such general provisions to fill up the details.\u201dWaymanv.Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42\u201343 (1825).\nDoubtless, what qualifies as an important subject and what\nconstitutes a detail may be debated. See,e.g.,Gundyv.United States, 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2019)\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 4\u20136);id., at ___\u2013___\n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10\u201312). But no less than\nits rules against retroactive legislation or protecting sovereign\nimmunity, the Constitution\u2019s rule vesting federal legislative power\nin Congress is \u201cvital to the integrity and maintenance of the\nsystem of government ordained by the Constitution.\u201dMarshall\nField & Co.v.Clark,143 U.S.\n649, 692 (1892).It is vital because the framers believed that a\nrepublic\u2014a thing of the people\u2014would be more likely to enact just\nlaws than a regime administered by a ruling class of largely\nunaccountable \u201cministers.\u201d The Federalist No. 11, p. 85 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). From time to time, some have\nquestioned that assessment.[1]\nBut by vesting the lawmaking power in the people\u2019s elected\nrepresentatives, the Constitution sought to ensure \u201cnot only that\nall power [w]ould be derived from the people,\u201d but also \u201cthat those\n[e]ntrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people.\u201dId., No. 37, at 227 (J. Madison). The Constitution, too,\nplaced its trust not in the hands of \u201ca few, but [in] a number of\nhands,\u201dibid., so that those who make our laws would better\nreflect the diversity of the people they represent and have an\n\u201cimmediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the\npeople.\u201dId., No. 52, at 327 (J. Madison). Today, some might\ndescribe the Constitution as having designed the federal lawmaking\nprocess to capture the wisdom of the masses. See P. Hamburger, Is\nAdministrative Law Unlawful? 502\u2013503 (2014).Admittedly, lawmaking under our Constitution can\nbe difficult. But that is nothing particular to our time nor any\naccident. The framers believed that the power to make new laws\nregulating private conduct was a grave one that could, if not\nproperly checked, pose a serious threat to individual liberty. See\nThe Federalist No. 48, at 309\u2013312 (J. Madison); see alsoid., No. 73, at 441\u2013442 (A. Hamilton). As a result, the\nframers deliberately sought to make lawmaking difficult by\ninsisting that two houses of Congress must agree to any new law and\nthe President must concur or a legislative supermajority must\noverride his veto.The difficulty of the design sought to serve\nother ends too. By effectively requiring a broad consensus to pass\nlegislation, the Constitution sought to ensure that any new laws\nwould enjoy wide social acceptance, profit from input by an array\nof different perspectives during their consideration, and thanks to\nall this prove stable over time. Seeid., No. 10, at 82\u201384\n(J. Madison). The need for compromise inherent in this design also\nsought to protect minorities by ensuring that their votes would\noften decide the fate of proposed legislation\u2014allowing them to\nwield real power alongside the majority. Seeid., No. 51, at\n322\u2013324 (J. Madison). The difficulty of legislating at the federal\nlevel aimed as well to preserve room for lawmaking \u201cby governments\nmore local and more accountable than a distant federal\u201d authority,National Federation of Independent Businessv.Sebelius,567 U.S.\n519, 536 (2012) (plurality opinion), and in this way allow\nStates to serve as \u201claborator[ies]\u201d for \u201cnovel social and economic\nexperiments,\u201dNew State Ice Co. v.Liebmann,285 U.S.\n262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); see J. Sutton, 51\nImperfect Solutions: States and the Making of American\nConstitutional Law 11 (2018).Permitting Congress to divest its legislative\npower to the Executive Branch would \u201cdash [this] whole scheme.\u201dDepartment of Transportationv.Association of American\nRailroads, 575 U.S. 43, 61 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring).\nLegislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the\ncurrent President, or, worse yet, the will of unelected officials\nbarely responsive to him. See S.\u00a0Breyer, Making Our Democracy\nWork: A Judge\u2019s View 110 (2010) (\u201c[T]he president may not have the\ntime or willingness to review [agency] decisions\u201d). In a world like\nthat, agencies could churn out new laws more or less at whim.\nIntrusions on liberty would not be difficult and rare, but easy and\nprofuse. See The Federalist No. 47, at 303 (J. Madison);id., No. 62, at 378 (J. Madison). Stability would be lost,\nwith vast numbers of laws changing with every new presidential\nadministration. Rather than embody a wide social consensus and\ninput from minority voices, laws would more often bear the support\nonly of the party currently in power. Powerful special interests,\nwhich are sometimes \u201cuniquely\u201d able to influence the agendas of\nadministrative agencies, would flourish while others would be left\nto ever-shifting winds. T. Merrill, Capture Theory and the Courts:\n1967\u20131983, 72 Chi.-Kent L.\u00a0Rev. 1039, 1043 (1997). Finally,\nlittle would remain to stop agencies from moving into areas where\nstate authority has traditionally predominated. See,e.g.,Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.v.Army Corps of\nEngineers,531 U.S.\n159, 173\u2013174 (2001) (SWANC). That would be a\nparticularly ironic outcome, given that so many States have robust\nnondelegation doctrines designed to ensure democratic\naccountability in their state lawmaking processes. See R. May, The\nNondelegation Doctrine is Alive and Well in the States, The Reg.\nRev. (Oct. 15, 2020).BMuch as constitutional rules about retroactive\nlegislation and sovereign immunity have their corollary\nclear-statement rules, Article I\u2019s Vesting Clause has its own: the\nmajor questions doctrine. SeeGundy, 588 U.\u00a0S., at\n___\u2013___ (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 20\u201321). Some\nversion of this clear-statement rule can be traced to at least\n1897, when this Court confronted a case involving the Interstate\nCommerce Commission, the federal government\u2019s \u201cfirst modern\nregulatory agency.\u201d S. Dudley, Milestones in the Evolution of the\nAdministrative State 3 (Nov. 2020). The ICC argued that Congress\nhad endowed it with the power to set carriage prices for railroads.\nSeeICCv.Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co.,167 U.S.\n479, 499 (1897). The Court deemed that claimed authority \u201ca\npower of supreme delicacy and importance,\u201d given the role railroads\nthen played in the Nation\u2019s life.Id., at 505. Therefore,\nthe Court explained, a special rule applied:\u201cThat Congress has transferred such a\npower to any administrative body is not to be presumed or implied\nfrom any doubtful and uncertain language. The words and phrases\nefficacious to make such a delegation of power are well understood,\nand have been frequently used, and if Congress had intended to\ngrant such a power to the [agency], it cannot be doubted that it\nwould have used languageopen to no misconstruction, butclear and direct.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).With the explosive growth of the administrative\nstate since 1970, the major questions doctrine soon took on special\nimportance.[2] In 1980, this\nCourt held it \u201cunreasonable to assume\u201d that Congress gave an agency\n\u201cunprecedented power[s]\u201d in the \u201cabsence of a clear [legislative]\nmandate.\u201dIndustrial Union Dept., AFL\u2013CIOv.American\nPetroleum Institute,448 U.S.\n607, 645 (plurality opinion). In the years that followed, the\nCourt routinely enforced \u201cthe nondelegation doctrine\u201d through \u201cthe\ninterpretation of statutory texts, and, more particularly, [by]\ngiving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might\notherwise be thought to be unconstitutional.\u201dMistrettav.United States,488 U.S.\n361, 373, n.\u00a07 (1989). In fact, this Court applied the\nmajor questions doctrine in \u201call corners of the administrative\nstate,\u201d whether the issue at hand involved an agency\u2019s asserted\npower to regulate tobacco products, ban drugs used in\nphysician-assisted suicide, extend Clean Air Act regulations to\nprivate homes, impose an eviction moratorium, or enforce a vaccine\nmandate.Ante, at 17; seeFDAv.Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp.,529 U.S.\n120, 160 (2000);Gonzalesv.Oregon,546 U.S.\n243, 267 (2006);Utility Air Regulatory Groupv.EPA,573 U.S.\n302, 324 (2014);Alabama Assn. of Realtorsv.Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2021) (per\u00a0curiam) (slip op., at 6);National\nFederation of Independent Businessv.OSHA, 595\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2022) (per\u00a0curiam) (slip op.,\nat\u00a06).[3]The Court has applied the major questions\ndoctrine for the same reason it has applied other similar\nclear-statement rules\u2014to ensure that the government does \u201cnot\ninadvertently cross constitutional lines.\u201d Barrett 175. And the\nconstitutional lines at stake here are surely no less important\nthan those this Court has long held sufficient to justify parallel\nclear-statement rules. At stake is not just a question of\nretroactive liability or sovereign immunity, but basic questions\nabout self-government, equality, fair notice, federalism, and the\nseparation of powers. See Part I\u2013A,supra. The major\nquestions doctrine seeks to protect against \u201cunintentional,\noblique, or otherwise unlikely\u201d intrusions on these interests.NFIBv.OSHA, 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 5). The doctrine does so by ensuring\nthat, when agencies seek to resolve major questions, they at least\nact with clear congressional authorization and do not \u201cexploit some\ngap, ambiguity, or doubtful expression in Congress\u2019s statutes to\nassume responsibilities far beyond\u201d those the people\u2019s\nrepresentatives actually conferred on them.Ibid.As the\nCourt aptly summarizes it today, the doctrine addresses \u201ca\nparticular and recurring problem: agencies asserting highly\nconsequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be\nunderstood to have granted.\u201dAnte, at 20.IIATurning from the doctrine\u2019s function to its\napplication, it seems to me that our cases supply a good deal of\nguidance about when an agency action involves a major question for\nwhich clear congressional authority is required.First, this Court has indicated that\nthe doctrine applies when an agency claims the power to resolve a\nmatter of great \u201cpolitical significance,\u201dNFIBv.OSHA, 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), or end an \u201cearnest and profound debate\nacross the country,\u201dGonzales, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 267\u2013268\n(internal quotation marks omitted); seeante, at 17. So, for\nexample, inGonzales, the Court found that the doctrine\napplied when the Attorney General issued a regulation that would\nhave effectively banned most forms of physician-assisted suicide\neven as certain States were considering whether to permit the\npractice. 546 U.\u00a0S., at 267. And inNFIBv.OSHA, the Court held the doctrine applied when an agency\nsought to mandate COVID\u201319 vaccines nationwide for most workers at\na time when Congress and state legislatures were engaged in robust\ndebates over vaccine mandates. 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at\n5);id., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).\nRelatedly, this Court has found it telling when Congress has\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018considered and rejected\u2019\u00a0\u201d bills authorizing something\nakin to the agency\u2019s proposed course of action.Ante, at 20,\n27 (quotingBrown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 144).\nThat too may be a sign that an agency is attempting to \u201c\u00a0\u2018work\n[a]round\u2019\u00a0\u201d the legislative process to resolve for itself a\nquestion of great political significance.NFIBv.OSHA, 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 3).[4]Second, this Court has said that an\nagency must point to clear congressional authorization when it\nseeks to regulate \u201c\u00a0\u2018a significant portion of the American\neconomy,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 18 (quotingUtility Air,\n573 U.\u00a0S., at 324), or require \u201cbillions of dollars in\nspending\u201d by private persons or entities,Kingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485 (2015). The Court has held that\nregulating tobacco products, eliminating rate regulation in the\ntelecommunications industry, subjecting private homes to Clean Air\nAct restrictions, and suspending local housing laws and regulations\ncan sometimes check this box. SeeBrown & Williamson,\n529 U.\u00a0S., at 160;MCI Telecommunications Corp.v.American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,512 U.S.\n218, 231 (1994) (MCI);Utility Air, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 324;Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).Third, this Court has said that the major\nquestions doctrine may apply when an agency seeks to \u201cintrud[e]\ninto an area that is the particular domain of state law.\u201dIbid. Of course, another longstanding clear-statement\nrule\u2014the federalism canon\u2014also applies in these situations. To\npreserve the \u201cproper balance between the States and the Federal\nGovernment\u201d and enforce limits on Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power,\ncourts must \u201c\u00a0\u2018be certain of Congress\u2019s intent\u2019\u00a0\u201d before\nfinding that it \u201clegislate[d] in areas traditionally regulated by\nthe States.\u201dGregoryv.Ashcroft,501 U.S.\n452, 459\u2013460 (1991). But unsurprisingly, the major questions\ndoctrine and the federalism canon often travel together. When an\nagency claims the power to regulate vast swaths of American life,\nit not only risks intruding on Congress\u2019s power, it also risks\nintruding on powers reserved to the States. SeeSWANC, 531\nU.\u00a0S., at 162, 174.While this list of triggers may not be\nexclusive, each of the signs the Court has found significant in the\npast is present here, making this a relatively easy case for the\ndoctrine\u2019s application. The EPA claims the power to force coal and\ngas-fired power plants \u201cto cease [operating] altogether.\u201dAnte, at 24. Whether these plants should be allowed to\noperate is a question on which people today may disagree, but it is\na question everyone can agree is vitally important. Seeante, at 24\u201325. Congress has debated the matter frequently.Ibid.; see generally Climate Change, The History of a\nConsensus and the Causes of Inaction, Hearing before the\nSubcommittee on Environment of the House Committee on Oversight and\nReform, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. I (2019). And so far it has\n\u201cconspicuously and repeatedly declined\u201d to adopt legislation\nsimilar to the Clean Power Plan (CPP).Ante, at 20; seeAmerican Lung Assn.v.EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 998,\nn.\u00a019 (CADC 2021) (Walker, J., concurring in part, concurring\nin judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (cataloguing failed\nlegislative proposals); cf.Brown & Williamson, 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 144. It seems that fact has frustrated the Executive\nBranch and led it to attempt its own regulatory solution in the\nCPP. See 985 F.\u00a03d, at 998, n. 20 (President stating that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018if Congress won\u2019t act soon . . . I will\u2019\u00a0\u201d); cf.United States Telecom Assn.v.FCC, 855 F.3d 381,\n423\u2013424 (CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of\nrehearing en banc) (noting a \u201cPresident\u2019s intervention [may]\nunderscor[e] the enormous significance\u201d of a regulation).Other suggestive factors are present too. \u201cThe\nelectric power sector is among the largest in the U.\u00a0S.\neconomy, with links to every other sector.\u201d N.\u00a0Richardson,\nKeeping Big Cases From Making Bad Law: The Resurgent \u201cMajor\nQuestions\u201d Doctrine, 49 Conn. L.\u00a0Rev. 355, 388 (2016). The\nExecutive Branch has acknowledged that its proposed rule would\nforce an \u201caggressive transformation\u201d of the electricity sector\nthrough \u201ctransition to zero-carbon renewable energy sources.\u201d White\nHouse Fact Sheet, App. inAmerican Lung Assn.v.EPA,\nNo. 19\u20131140 (CADC), pp. 2076\u20132077. The Executive Branch has also\npredicted its rule would force dozens of power plants to close and\neliminate thousands of jobs by 2025. See EPA, Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis for the Clean Power Plan Final Rule 3\u201327, 3\u201330, 3\u201333, 6\u201325\n(Oct. 23, 2015). And industry analysts have estimated the CPP would\ncause consumers\u2019 electricity costs to rise by over $200 billion.\nSee National Mining Assn., EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan: An Economic\nImpact Analysis 2, 4 (2015). Finally, the CPP unquestionably has an\nimpact on federalism, as \u201cthe regulation of utilities is one of the\nmost important of the functions traditionally associated with the\npolice power of the States.\u201dArkansas Elec. Cooperative\nCorp.v.Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n,461 U.S.\n375, 377 (1983). None of this is to say the policy the agency\nseeks to pursue is unwise or should not be pursued. It is only to\nsay that the agency seeks to resolve for itself the sort of\nquestion normally reserved for Congress. As a result, we look for\nclear evidence that the people\u2019s representatives in Congress have\nactually afforded the agency the power it claims.BAt this point, the question becomes what\nqualifies as a clear congressional statement authorizing an\nagency\u2019s action. Courts have long experience applying\nclear-statement rules throughout the law, and our cases have\nidentified several telling clues in this context too.First, courts must look to the\nlegislative provisions on which the agency seeks to rely\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018with a view to their place in the overall statutory\nscheme.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBrown & Williamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at\n133. \u201c[O]blique or elliptical language\u201d will not supply a clear\nstatement.Ante, at 18; seeSpectorv.Norwegian\nCruise Line Ltd.,545 U.S.\n119, 139 (2005) (plurality opinion) (cautioning against\nreliance on \u201cbroad or general language\u201d). Nor may agencies seek to\nhide \u201celephants in mouseholes,\u201dWhitmanv.American\nTrucking Assns., Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 468 (2001), or rely on \u201cgap filler\u201d provisions,ante, at 20. So, for example, inMCIthis Court\nrejected the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s attempt to\neliminate rate regulation for the telecommunications industry based\non a \u201csubtle\u201d provision that empowered the FCC to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018modify\u2019\u00a0\u201d rates. 512 U.\u00a0S., at 231. InBrown\n& Williamson, the Court rejected the Food and Drug\nAdministration\u2019s attempt to regulate cigarettes based a \u201ccryptic\u201d\nstatutory provision that granted the agency the power to regulate\n\u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201cdevices.\u201d 529 U.\u00a0S., at 126, 156, 160. And inGonzales, the Court doubted that Congress gave the Attorney\nGeneral \u201cbroad and unusual authority\u201d to regulate drugs for\nphysician-assisted suicide through \u201coblique\u201d statutory language.\n546 U.\u00a0S., at 267.Second, courts may examine the age and\nfocus of the statute the agency invokes in relation to the problem\nthe agency seeks to address. As the Court puts it today, it is\nunlikely that Congress will make an \u201c[e]xtraordinary gran[t] of\nregulatory authority\u201d through \u201cvague language\u201d in \u201c\u00a0\u2018a\nlong-extant statute.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 18\u201320 (quotingUtility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 324). Recently, too, this\nCourt found a clear statement lacking when OSHA sought to impose a\nnationwide COVID\u201319 vaccine mandate based on a statutory provision\nthat was adopted 40 years before the pandemic and that focused on\nconditions specific to the workplace rather than a problem faced by\nsociety at large. SeeNFIBv.OSHA, 595 U.\u00a0S.,\nat ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3). Of course,\nsometimes old statutes may be written in ways that apply to new and\npreviously unanticipated situations. SeeSedima,\nS.\u00a0P.\u00a0R. L.v.Imrex Co.,473 U.S.\n479, 499 (1985). But an agency\u2019s attempt to deploy an old\nstatute focused on one problem to solve a new and different problem\nmay also be a warning sign that it is acting without clear\ncongressional authority. Seeante, at 18.Third, courts may examine the agency\u2019s\npast interpretations of the relevant statute. Seeante, at\n20\u201321. A \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d and long-held Executive Branch\ninterpretation of a statute is entitled to some weight as evidence\nof the statute\u2019s original charge to an agency.United Statesv.Philbrick,120 U.S.\n52, 59 (1887). Conversely, inNFIBv.OSHA, the\nCourt found it \u201ctelling that OSHA, in its half century of\nexistence, ha[d] never before adopted a broad public health\nregulation\u201d under the statute that the agency sought to invoke as\nauthority for a nationwide vaccine mandate. 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 8);ante, at 18; see alsoBrown &\nWilliamson, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 158\u2013159 (noting that for decades\nthe FDA had said it lacked statutory power to regulate cigarettes).\nAs the Court states today, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the want of [an] assertion of\npower by those who presumably would be alert\u2019\u00a0\u201d to it is\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018significant in determining whether such power was actually\nconferred.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 21. When an agency claims to\nhave found a previously \u201cunheralded power,\u201d its assertion generally\nwarrants \u201ca measure of skepticism.\u201dUtility Air, 573\nU.\u00a0S., at 324.Fourth, skepticism may be merited when\nthere is a mismatch between an agency\u2019s challenged action and its\ncongressionally assigned mission and expertise.Ante, at 25.\nAs the Court explains, \u201c[w]hen an agency has no comparative\nexpertise in making certain policy judgments, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nCongress presumably would not task it with doing so.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). So, for\nexample, inAlabama Assn. of Realtors, this Court rejected\nan attempt by a public health agency to regulate housing. 594\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). And inNFIBv.OSHA, the Court rejected an effort by a workplace safety\nagency to ordain \u201cbroad public health measures\u201d that \u201cf[ell]\noutside [its] sphere of expertise.\u201d 595 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6).[5]Asking these questions again yields a clear\nanswer in our case. Seeante, at 28\u201331. As the Court\ndetails, the agency before us cites no specific statutory authority\nallowing it to transform the Nation\u2019s electrical power supply. Seeante, at 28. Instead, the agency relies on a rarely invoked\nstatutory provision that was passed with little debate and has been\ncharacterized as an \u201cobscure, never-used section of the law.\u201dAnte, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor has the\nagency previously interpreted the relevant provision to confer on\nit such vast authority; there is no original, longstanding, and\nconsistent interpretation meriting judicial respect. Seeante, at 20\u201322. Finally, there is a \u201cmismatch\u201d between the\nEPA\u2019s expertise over environmental matters and the agency\u2019s claim\nthat \u201cCongress implicitly tasked it, and it alone, with balancing\nthe many vital considerations of national policy implicated in\ndeciding how Americans will get their energy.\u201dAnte, at 25.\nSuch a claimed power \u201crequires technical and policy expertisenottraditionally needed in [the] EPA\u2019s regulatory\ndevelopment.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).\nAgain, in observing this much, the Court does not purport to pass\non the wisdom of the agency\u2019s course. It acknowledges only that\nagency officials have sought to resolve a major policy question\nwithout clear legislative authorization to do so.IIIIn places, the dissent seems to suggest that\nwe should not be unduly \u201c\u00a0\u2018concerned\u2019\u00a0\u201d with the\nConstitution\u2019s assignment of the legislative power to Congress.Post, at 29 (opinion of Kagan, J.). Echoing Woodrow Wilson,\nthe dissent seems to think \u201ca modern Nation\u201d cannot afford such\nsentiments.Post, at 29\u201331. But recently, our dissenting\ncolleagues acknowledged that the Constitution assigns \u201call\nlegislative Powers\u201d to Congress and \u201cbar[s their] further\ndelegation.\u201dGundy, 588 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion of Kagan, J.) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nand alteration omitted). To be sure, in that case we disagreed\nabout the exact nature of the \u201cnondelegation inquiry\u201d courts must\nemploy to vindicate the Constitution.Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 5). But like Chief Justice Marshall, we all recognized that the\nConstitution does impose some limits on the delegation of\nlegislative power. Seeibid.;Wayman, 10 Wheat., at\n42\u201343. And while we all agree that administrative agencies have\nimportant roles to play in a modern nation, surely none of us\nwishes to abandon our Republic\u2019s promise that the people and their\nrepresentatives should have a meaningful say in the laws that\ngovern them. Cf.Ruchov.Common Cause, 588\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7)\n(\u201cRepublican liberty demands not only, that all power should be\nderived from the people; but that those entrusted with it should be\nkept in dependence on the people\u201d (internal quotation marks and\nalteration omitted)).[6]So what is our real point of disagreement? The\ndissent next suggests that the Court strays from its commitment to\ntextualism by relying on a clear-statement rule (the major\nquestions doctrine) to resolve today\u2019s case.Post, at 28.\nBut our law is full of clear-statement rules and has been since the\nfounding. Our colleagues do not dispute the point. In fact, they\nhave regularly invoked many of these rules.[7]If that\u2019s not the problem, perhaps the dissent\nmeans to suggest that the major questions doctrine does not belong\non the list of our clear-statement rules. At times, the dissent\nappears to dismiss the doctrine as a \u201cget-out-of-text free car[d].\u201dIbid. The dissent even seems to suggest that the doctrine\ncould threaten \u201cthe safety and efficacy of medications\u201d or lead to\n\u201cthe routine adulteration of food.\u201dPost, at 31. But then\nagain, the dissent also acknowledges that the major questions\ndoctrine should \u201csensibl[y]\u201d apply in at least some situations.Post, at 14\u201315. The dissent even favorably highlights one\napplication of the doctrine that our colleagues criticized less\nthan a year ago. Seepost, at 18 (citingAlabama Assn. of\nRealtors, 594 U.\u00a0S. ___). And, of course, our colleagues\nhave joined other applications of the major questions doctrine in\nthe past. See,e.g.,King, 576 U.\u00a0S., at\n485\u2013486;Gonzales, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 267\u2013268. Nor does the\ndissent really seem to dispute that a major question is at stake in\nthis case. As the dissent observes, the agency\u2019s challenged action\nbefore us concerns one of \u201cthe greatest .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nchallenge[s] of our time.\u201dPost, at 21. If this case does\nnot implicate a \u201cquestion of deep economic and political\nsignificance,\u201dKing, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 486 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it is unclear what might.[8]In the end, our disagreement really seems to\ncenter on a difference of opinion about whether the statute at\nissue here clearly authorizes the agency to adopt the CPP. The\ndissent even complains that I have failed to conduct an exhaustive\nanalysis of the relevant statutory language. Seepost, at\n28, n.\u00a08. But in this concurrence, I have sought to provide\nsome observations about the underlying doctrine on which today\u2019s\ndecision rests. On the merits of the case before us, I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, which comprehensively sets forth why Congress did\nnot clearly authorize the EPA to engage in a \u201cgeneration shifting\napproach\u201d to the production of energy in this country.Ante,\nat 28. In reaching its judgment, the Court hardly professes to\n\u201cappoin[t] itself\u201d \u201cthe decision-maker on climate policy.\u201dPost, at 33. The Court acknowledges only that, under our\nConstitution, the people\u2019s elected representatives in Congress are\nthe decisionmakers here\u2014and they have not clearly granted the\nagency the authority it claims for itself.Ante, at 31.*When Congress seems slow to solve problems, it\nmay be only natural that those in the Executive Branch might seek\nto take matters into their own hands. But the Constitution does not\nauthorize agencies to use pen-and-phone regulations as substitutes\nfor laws passed by the people\u2019s representatives. In our Republic,\n\u201c[i]t is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe\ngeneral rules for the government of society.\u201dFletcherv.Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810). Because today\u2019s decision\nhelps safeguard that foundational constitutional promise, I am\npleased to concur.Notes1For example, Woodrow\nWilson famously argued that \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d \u201cembarrasse[d]\u201d\nthe Nation because it made it harder to achieve \u201cexecutive\nexpertness.\u201d The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197, 207\n(1887) (Administration). In Wilson\u2019s eyes, the mass of the people\nwere \u201cselfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish.\u201dId.,\nat 208. He expressed even greater disdain for particular groups,\ndefending \u201c[t]he white men of the South\u201d for \u201crid[ding] themselves,\nby fair means or foul, of the intolerable burden of governments\nsustained by the votes of ignorant [African-Americans].\u201d 9 W.\nWilson, History of the American People 58 (1918). He likewise\ndenounced immigrants \u201cfrom the south of Italy and men of the meaner\nsort out of Hungary and Poland,\u201d who possessed \u201cneither skill nor\nenergy nor any initiative of quick intelligence.\u201d 5id., at\n212. To Wilson, our Republic \u201ctr[ied] to do too much by vote.\u201d\nAdministration 214.2In the 1960s and 1970s,\nCongress created dozens of new federal administrative agencies. See\nW. Howell & D. Lewis, Agencies by Presidential Design, 64 J. of\nPolitics 1095, 1105 (Nov. 2002). Between 1970 and 1990, the Code of\nFederal Regulations grew from about 44,000 pages to about 106,000.\nSee C. DeMuth, Can the Administrative State be Tamed?, 8 J. Legal\nAnalysis 121, 126 (Feb. 2016). Today, Congress issues \u201croughly two\nhundred to four hundred laws\u201d every year, while \u201cfederal\nadministrative agencies adopt something on the order of three\nthousand to five thousand final rules.\u201d R. Cass, Rulemaking Then\nand Now: From Management to Lawmaking, 28 Geo. Mason L.\u00a0Rev.\n683, 694 (2021). Beyond that, agencies regularly \u201cproduce\nthousands, if not millions,\u201d of guidance documents which, as a\npractical matter, bind affected parties too. See\nC.\u00a0Coglianese, Illuminating Regulatory Guidance, 9 Mich. J.\nEnv. & Admin. L. 243, 247\u2013248 (2020).3At times, this Court\napplied the major questions doctrine more like an ambiguity canon.\nSeeFDAv.Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,529 U.S.\n120, 159 (2000). Ambiguity canons merely instruct courts on how\nto \u201cchoos[e] between equally plausible interpretations of ambiguous\ntext,\u201d and are thus weaker than clear-statement rules. Barrett 109.\nBut our precedents have usually applied the doctrine as a\nclear-statement rule, and the Court today confirms that is the\nproper way to apply it. Seeante, at 19\u201320, 28.4In the dissent\u2019s view,\nthe Court has erred both today and in the past by pointing to\nfailed legislation.Post, at 27\u201328 (opinion of Kagan, J.).\nBut the Court has not pointed to failed legislation to resolve what\na duly enacted statutory text means, only to help resolve the\nantecedent question whether the agency\u2019s challenged action\nimplicates a major question. The dissent endorses looking to\nextrinsic evidence to resolve that question too. Seepost,\nat 21\u201322 (discussing whether there is a \u201cmismatch\u201d between an\nagency\u2019s expertise and its challenged action).5The dissent not only\nagrees that a mismatch between an agency\u2019s expertise and its\nchallenged action is relevant to the major questions doctrine\nanalysis; the dissent suggests that such a mismatch is necessary to\nthe doctrine\u2019s application. Seepost, at 14\u201315. But this\nCourt has never taken that view. See,e.g.,ICCv.Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co.,167 U.S.\n479, 505 (1897) (interstate commerce agency regulating\ninterstate railroad commerce);Industrial Union Dept.,\nAFL\u2013CIOv.American Petroleum Institute,448 U.S.\n607, 645 (1980) (plurality opinion) (workplace safety agency\nregulating workplace carcinogens);Brown & Williamson,\n529 U.\u00a0S., at 159\u2013160 (drug agency regulating tobacco);Kingv.Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485\u2013486 (2015) (tax\nagency administering tax credits).6In the course of its\nargument, the dissent leans heavily on two recent academic\narticles.Post, at 29. But if a battle of law reviews were\nthe order of the day, it might be worth adding to the reading list.\nSee,e.g., I. Wurman, Nondelegation at the Founding, 130\nYale L.
