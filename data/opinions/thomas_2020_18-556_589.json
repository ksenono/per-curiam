We hold that when the officer lacks information negating\nan inference that the owner is the driver of the vehicle, the stop\nis reasonable.IKansas charged respondent Charles Glover, Jr.,\nwith driving as a habitual violator after a traffic stop revealed\nthat he was driving with a revoked license. See Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a78\u2013285(a)(3) (2001). Glover filed a motion to suppress all evidence\nseized during the stop, claiming that the officer lacked reasonable\nsuspicion. Neither Glover nor the police officer testified at the\nsuppression hearing. Instead, the parties stipulated to the\nfollowing facts:\u201c1. Deputy Mark Mehrer is a certified law\nenforcement officer employed by the Douglas County Kansas\nSheriff\u00a0\u2019s Office.2. On April 28, 2016, Deputy Mehrer was on\nroutine patrol in Douglas County when he observed a 1995 Chevrolet\n1500 pickup truck with Kansas plate 295ATJ.3. Deputy Mehrer ran Kansas plate 295ATJ\nthrough the Kansas Department of Revenue\u2019s file service. The\nregistration came back to a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck.4. Kansas Department of Revenue files indicated\nthe truck was registered to Charles Glover Jr. The files also\nindicated that Mr. Glover had a revoked driver\u2019s license in the\nState of Kansas.5. Deputy Mehrer assumed the registered owner\nof the truck was also the driver, Charles Glover Jr.6. Deputy Mehrer did not observe any traffic\ninfractions, and did not attempt to identify the driver [of] the\ntruck. Based solely on the information that the registered owner of\nthe truck was revoked, Deputy Mehrer initiated a traffic stop.7. The driver of the truck was identified as the\ndefendant, Charles Glover Jr.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 60\u201361.The District Court granted Glover\u2019s motion to\nsuppress. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u201cit was\nreasonable for [Deputy] Mehrer to infer that the driver was the\nowner of the vehicle\u201d because \u201cthere were specific and articulable\nfacts from which the officer\u2019s common-sense inference gave rise to\na reasonable suspicion.\u201d 54 Kan. App. 2d 377, 385, 400 P.3d 182,\n188 (2017).The Kansas Supreme Court reversed. According to\nthe court, Deputy Mehrer did not have reasonable suspicion because\nhis inference that Glover was behind the wheel amounted to \u201conly a\nhunch\u201d that Glover was engaging in criminal activity. 308 Kan. 590,\n591, 422 P.3d 64, 66 (2018). The court further explained that\nDeputy Mehrer\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d involved \u201capplying and stacking unstated\nassumptions that are unreasonable without further factual basis,\u201d\nnamely, that \u201cthe registered owner was likely the primary driver of\nthe vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthe owner will likely disregard the\nsuspension or revocation order and continue to drive.\u201dId.,at 595\u2013597, 422 P.\u00a03d, at 68\u201370. We granted Kansas\u2019 petition\nfor a writ of certiorari, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), and now\nreverse.IIUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, the Fourth\nAmendment permits an officer to initiate a brief investigative\ntraffic stop when he has \u201ca particularized and objective basis for\nsuspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201dUnited Statesv.Cortez,449\nU.S. 411, 417\u2013418 (1981); see alsoTerryv.Ohio,392 U.S.\n1, 21\u201322 (1968). \u201cAlthough a mere \u2018hunch\u2019 does not create\nreasonable suspicion, the level of suspicion the standard requires\nis considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, and obviously less than is necessary for probable\ncause.\u201dPradoNavarettev.California,572 U.S.\n393, 397 (2014) (quotation altered);United Statesv.Sokolow,490 U.S.\n1, 7 (1989).Because it is a \u201cless demanding\u201d standard,\n\u201creasonable suspicion can be established with information that is\ndifferent in quantity or content than that required to establish\nprobable cause.\u201dAlabamav.White,496 U.S.\n325, 330 (1990). The standard \u201cdepends on the factual and\npractical considerations of everyday life on whichreasonable\nand prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201dNavarette,supra, at 402 (quotingOrnelasv.United\nStates,517 U.S.\n690, 695 (1996) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Courts \u201ccannot reasonably demand scientific certainty\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. where none exists.\u201dIllinoisv.Wardlow,528 U.S.\n119, 125 (2000). Rather, they must permit officers to make\n\u201ccommonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior.\u201dIbid.; see alsoNavarette,supra, at 403\n(noting that an officer \u201c\u00a0\u2018need not rule out the possibility\nof innocent conduct\u2019\u00a0\u201d).IIIWe have previously recognized that States have\na \u201cvital interest in ensuring that only those qualified to do so\nare permitted to operate motor vehicles [and] that licensing,\nregistration, and vehicle inspection requirements are being\nobserved.\u201dDelawarev.Prouse,440 U.S.\n648, 658 (1979). With this in mind, we turn to whether the\nfacts known to Deputy Mehrer at the time of the stop gave rise to\nreason- able suspicion. We conclude that they did.Before initiating the stop, Deputy Mehrer\nobserved an individual operating a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck\nwith Kansas plate 295ATJ. He also knew that the registered owner of\nthe truck had a revoked license and that the model of the truck\nmatched the observed vehicle. From these three facts, Deputy Mehrer\ndrew the commonsense inference that Glover was likely the driver of\nthe vehicle, which provided more than reasonable suspicion to\ninitiate the stop.The fact that the registered owner of a vehicle\nis not always the driver of the vehicle does not negate the reason-\nableness of Deputy Mehrer\u2019s inference. Such is the case with all\nreasonable inferences. The reasonable suspicion inquiry \u201cfalls\nconsiderably short\u201d of 51% accuracy, seeUnited Statesv.Arvizu,534 U.S.\n266, 274 (2002), for, as we have explained, \u201c[t]o be reasonable\nis not to be perfect,\u201dHeienv.North Carolina,574 U.S.\n54, 60 (2014).Glover\u2019s revoked license does not render Deputy\nMehrer\u2019s inference unreasonable either. Empirical studies\ndemonstrate what common experience readily reveals: Drivers with\nrevoked licenses frequently continue to drive and therefore to pose\nsafety risks to other motorists and pedestrians. See,e.g.,\n2 T. Neuman et\u00a0al., National Coop. Hwy. Research Program\nReport 500: A Guide for Addressing Collisions Involving Unlicensed\nDrivers and Drivers With Suspended or Revoked Licenses,\np.\u00a0III\u20131 (2003) (noting that 75% of drivers with suspended or\nrevoked licenses continue to drive); National Hwy. and Traffic\nSafety Admin., Research Note: Driver License Compliance Status in\nFatal Crashes 2 (Oct. 2014) (noting that approximately 19% of motor\nvehicle fatalities from 2008\u20132012 \u201cinvolved drivers with invalid\nlicenses\u201d).Although common sense suffices to justify this\ninference, Kansas law reinforces that it is reasonable to infer\nthat an individual with a revoked license may continue driving. The\nState\u2019s license-revocation scheme covers drivers who have already\ndemonstrated a disregard for the law or are categorically unfit to\ndrive. The Division of Vehicles of the Kansas Department of Revenue\n(Division) \u201cshall\u201d revoke a driver\u2019s license upon certain\nconvictions for involuntary manslaughter, vehicular homicide,\nbattery, reckless driving, fleeing or attempting to elude a police\nofficer, or conviction of a felony in which a motor vehicle is\nused. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a78\u2013254(a), 8\u2013252. Reckless driving is\ndefined as \u201cdriv[ing] any vehicle in willful or wanton disregard\nfor the safety of persons or property.\u201d \u00a78\u20131566(a). The Division\nalso has discretion to revoke a license if a driver \u201c[h]as been\nconvicted with such frequency of serious offenses against traffic\nregulations governing the movement of vehicles as to indicate a\ndisrespect for traffic laws and a disregard for the safety of other\npersons on the highways,\u201d \u201chas been convicted of three or more\nmoving traffic violations committed on separate occasions within a\n12-month period,\u201d \u201cis incompetent to drive a motor vehicle,\u201d or\n\u201chas been convicted of a moving traffic violation, committed at a\ntime when the person\u2019s driving privileges were restricted,\nsuspended[,] or revoked.\u201d \u00a7\u00a78\u2013255(a)(1)\u2013(4). Other reasons include\nviolating license restrictions, \u00a78\u2013245(c), being under house\narrest, \u00a721\u20136609(c), and being a habitual violator, \u00a78\u2013286, which\nKansas defines as a resident or nonresident who has been convicted\nthree or more times within the past five years of certain\nenumerated driving offenses, \u00a78\u2013285. The concerns motivating the\nState\u2019s various grounds for revocation lend further credence to the\ninference that a registered owner with a revoked Kansas driver\u2019s\nlicense might be the one driving the vehicle.IVGlover and the dissent respond with two\narguments as to why Deputy Mehrer lacked reasonable suspicion.\nNeither is persuasive.AFirst, Glover and the dissent argue that\nDeputy Mehrer\u2019s inference was unreasonable because it was not\ngrounded in his law enforcement training or experience. Nothing in\nour Fourth Amendment precedent supports the notion that, in\ndetermining whether reasonable suspicion exists, an officer can\ndraw inferences based on knowledge gained only through law\nenforcement training and experience. We have repeatedly recognized\nthe opposite. InNavarette, we noted a number of\nbehaviors\u2014including driving in the median, crossing the center line\non a highway, and swerving\u2014that as a matter of common sense provide\n\u201csound indicia of drunk driving.\u201d 572 U.\u00a0S., at 402. InWardlow, we made the unremarkable observation that\n\u201c[h]eadlong flight\u2014wherever it occurs\u2014is the consummate act of\nevasion\u201d and therefore could factor into a police officer\u2019s\nreasonable suspicion determination. 528 U.\u00a0S., at 124. And inSokolow, we recognized that the defendant\u2019s method of\npayment for an airplane ticket contributed to the agents\u2019\nreasonable suspicion of drug trafficking because we \u201cfe[lt]\nconfident\u201d that \u201c[m]ost business travelers .\u00a0.\u00a0. purchase\nairline tickets by credit card or check\u201d rather than cash. 490\nU.\u00a0S., at 8\u20139. So too here. The inference that the driver of a\ncar is its registered owner does not require any specialized\ntraining; rather, it is a reasonable inference made by ordinary\npeople on a daily basis.The dissent reads our cases differently,\ncontending that they permit an officer to use only the common sense\nderived from his \u201cexperiences in law enforcement.\u201dPost, at\n5 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Such a standard defies the \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d understanding of common sense,i.e., information that\nis accessible to people generally, not just some specialized subset\nof society. More importantly, this standard appears nowhere in our\nprecedent. In fact, we have stated that reasonable suspicion is an\n\u201cabstract\u201d concept that cannot be reduced to \u201ca neat set of legal\nrules,\u201dArvizu, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 274 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), and we have repeatedly rejected courts\u2019 efforts to\nimpose a rigid structure on the concept of reasonableness,ibid.;Sokolow, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 7\u20138. This is\nprecisely what the dissent\u2019s rule would do by insisting that\nofficers must be treated as bifurcated persons, completely\nprecluded from drawing factual inferences based on the commonly\nheld knowledge they have acquired in their everyday lives.The dissent\u2019s rule would also impose on police\nthe burden of pointing to specific training materials or field\nexperiences justifying reasonable suspicion for the myriad\ninfractions in municipal criminal codes. And by removing common\nsense as a source of evidence, the dissent would considerably\nnarrow the daylight between the showing required for probable cause\nand the \u201cless stringent\u201d showing required for reasonable suspicion.Prouse, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 654; seeWhite, 496\nU.\u00a0S., at 330. Finally, it would impermissibly tie a traffic\nstop\u2019s validity to the officer\u2019s length of service. SeeDevenpeckv.Alford,543 U.S.\n146, 154 (2004). Such requirements are inconsistent with our\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence, and we decline to adopt them\nhere.In reaching this conclusion, we in no way\nminimize the significant role that specialized training and\nexperience routinely play in law enforcement investigations. See,e.g.,Arvizu, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 273\u2013274. We simply\nhold that such experience is notrequiredin every\ninstance.BGlover and the dissent also contend that\nadopting Kansas\u2019 view would eviscerate the need for officers to\nbase reasonable suspicion on \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d\nparticularized to the individual, seeTerry, 392 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 21, because police could instead rely exclusively on\nprobabilities. Their argument carries little force.As an initial matter, we have previously stated\nthat officers, like jurors, may rely on probabilities in the\nreasonable suspicion context. SeeSokolow, 490 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 8\u20139;Cortez, 449 U.\u00a0S., at 418. Moreover, as\nexplained above, Deputy Mehrer did not rely exclusively on\nprobabilities. He knew that the license plate was linked to a truck\nmatching the observed vehicle and that the registered owner of the\nvehicle had a revoked license. Based on these minimal facts, he\nused common sense to form a reasonable suspicion that a specific\nindividual was potentially engaged in specific criminal\nactivity\u2014driving with a revoked license. Traffic stops of this\nnature do not delegate to officers \u201cbroad and unlimited discretion\u201d\nto stop drivers at random.United Statesv.Brignoni-Ponce,422 U.S.\n873, 882 (1975). Nor do they allow officers to stop drivers\nwhose conduct is no different from any other driver\u2019s. SeeBrownv.Texas,443 U.S.\n47, 52 (1979). Accordingly, combining database information and\ncommonsense judgments in this context is fully consonant with this\nCourt\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents.[1]VThis Court\u2019s precedents have repeatedly\naffirmed that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is \u201creasonableness.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dHeien, 574\nU.\u00a0S., at 60 (quotingRileyv.California,573 U.S.\n373, 381 (2014)). Under the totality of the circumstances of\nthis case, Deputy Mehrer drew an entirely reasonable inference that\nGlover was driving while his license was revoked.We emphasize the narrow scope of our holding.\nLike all seizures, \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s action must be \u2018justified at\nits inception.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHiibelv.Sixth Judicial Dist.\nCourt of Nev.,Humboldt Cty.,542\nU.S. 177, 185 (2004) (quotingUnited Statesv.Sharpe,470 U.S.\n675, 682 (1985)). \u201cThe standard takes into account the totality\nof the circumstances\u2014the whole picture.\u201dNavarette, 572\nU.\u00a0S., at 397 (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result,\nthe presence of additional facts might dispel reasonable suspicion.\nSeeTerry,supra, at 28. For example, if an officer\nknows that the registered owner of the vehicle is in his\nmid-sixties but observes that the driver is in her mid-twenties,\nthen the totality of the circumstances would not \u201craise a suspicion\nthat the particular individual being stopped is engaged in\nwrongdoing.\u201dCortez, 449 U.\u00a0S., at 418;Ornelas,\n517 U.\u00a0S., at 696 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[e]ach case is to be decided on its\nown facts and circumstances\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingKerv.California,374 U.S.\n23, 33 (1963))). Here, Deputy Mehrer possessed no exculpatory\ninformation\u2014let alone sufficient information to rebut the\nreasonable inference that Glover was driving his own truck\u2014and thus\nthe stop was justified.[2]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the\njudgment of the Kansas Supreme Court, and we remand the case for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The dissent contends that\nthis approach \u201cpave[s] the road to finding reasonable suspicion\nbased on nothing more than a demographic profile.\u201dPost, at\n6\u20137 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). To alleviate any doubt, we\nreiterate that the Fourth Amendment requires, and Deputy Mehrer\nhad, an individualized suspicion that a particular citizen was\nengaged in a particular crime. Such a particularized suspicion\nwould be lacking in the dissent\u2019s hypothetical scenario, which, in\nany event, is already prohibited by our precedents. SeeUnited\nStatesv.Brignoni-Ponce,422 U.S.\n873, 876 (1975) (holding that it violated the Fourth Amendment\nto stop and \u201cquestion [a vehicle\u2019s] occupants [about their\nimmigration status] when the only ground for suspicion [was] that\nthe occupants appear[ed] to be of Mexican ancestry\u201d).2The dissent argues that\nthis approach impermissibly places the burden of proof on the\nindividual to negate the inference of reasonable suspicion.Post, at 3. Not so. As the above analysis makes clear, it is\nthe information possessed bythe officerat the time of the\nstop, not any information offered by the individual after the fact,\nthat can negate the inference.",
