MURR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.WISCONSIN, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals\nof wisconsin, district iii[June 23, 2017]Justice Thomas, dissenting.I join The Chief Justice\u2019s dissent because it\ncorrectly applies this Court\u2019s regulatory takings precedents, which\nno party has asked us to reconsider. The Court, however, has never\npurported to ground those precedents in the Constitution as it was\noriginally understood. InPennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393, 415 (1922) , the Court announced\na \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cif regulation goes too far it will be\nrecognized as a taking.\u201d But we have since observed that, prior toMahon, \u201cit was generally thought that the Takings Clause\nreached only a \u2018direct appropriation\u2019 of property,Legal Tender\nCases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent\nof a \u2018practical ouster of [the owner\u2019s] possession,\u2019Transportation Co.v.Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642\n(1879) .\u201dLucasv.South Carolina Coastal Council,\n505 U.\u00a0S. 1003, 1014 (1992) . In my view, it would be\ndesirable for us to take a fresh look at our regulatory takings\njurisprudence, to see whether it can be grounded in the original\npublic meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\ngenerally Rappaport, Originalism and Regulatory Takings: Why the\nFifth Amendment May Not Protect Against Regulatory Takings, but the\nFourteenth Amendment May, 45 San Diego L.\u00a0Rev. 729 (2008)\n(describing the debate among scholars over those questions).",
