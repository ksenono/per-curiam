In this case, we must decide whether a Georgia law\nthat creates special-purpose public entities called hospital\nauthorities and gives those entities general corporate powers,\nincluding the power to acquire hospitals, clearly articulates and\naffirmatively expresses a state policy to permit acquisitions that\nsubstantially lessen competition. Because Georgia\u2019s grant of\ngeneral cor- porate powers to hospital authorities does not include\npermission to use those powers anticompetitively, we hold that the\nclear-articulation test is not satisfied and state-action immunity\ndoes not apply.IAIn 1941, the State of Georgia amended its\nConstitution to allow political subdivisions to provide health care\nservices. 1941 Ga. Laws p. 50. The State concurrently enacted the\nHospital Authorities Law (Law),id., at 241, Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a731\u20137\u201370et\u00a0seq.(2012), \u201cto provide a mechanism for\nthe operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in\nthe several counties and municipalities of th[e] state.\u201d\n\u00a731\u20137\u201376(a). \u201cThe purpose of the constitutional provision and the\nstatute based thereon was to .\u00a0.\u00a0. create an organization\nwhich could carry out and make more workable the duty which the\nState owed to its in- digent sick.\u201dDeJarnettev.Hospital Auth. of Albany, 195 Ga. 189, 200, 23 S.E.2d 716,\n723 (1942) (citations omitted). As amended, the Law authorizes each\ncounty and municipality, and certain combinations of counties or\nmunicipalities, to create \u201ca public body corporate and politic\u201d\ncalled a \u201chospital authority.\u201d \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201372(a), (d). Hospital\nauthorities are governed by 5- to 9-member boards that are\nappointed by the governing body of the county or municipality in\ntheir area of operation. \u00a731\u20137\u201372(a).Under the Law, a hospital authority \u201cexercise[s]\npublic and essential governmental functions\u201d and is delegated \u201call\nthe powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate\u201d the\nLaw\u2019s purposes. \u00a731\u20137\u201375. Giving more content to that general\ndelegation, the Law enumerates 27 powers conferred upon hospital\nauthorities, including the power \u201c[t]o acquire by purchase, lease,\nor otherwise and to operate projects,\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4), which are\ndefined to include hospitals and other public health facilities,\n\u00a731\u20137\u201371(5); \u201c[t]o construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, and\nrepair projects,\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201375(5); \u201c[t]o lease .\u00a0.\u00a0. for\noperation by others any project\u201d provided certain conditions are\nsatisfied, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7); and \u201c[t]o establish rates and charges for\nthe services and use of the facilities of the authority,\u201d\n\u00a731\u20137\u201375(10). Hospital authorities may not operate or construct any\nproject for profit, and accordingly they must set rates so as only\nto cover operating expenses and create reasonable reserves.\n\u00a731\u20137\u201377.BIn the same year that the Law was adopted, the\ncity of Albany and Dougherty County established the Hospital\nAuthority of Albany-Dougherty County (Authority) and the Authority\npromptly acquired Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (Memorial), which\nhas been in operation in Al- bany since 1911. In 1990, the\nAuthority restructured its operations by forming two private\nnonprofit corporations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health\nSystem, Inc. (PPHS), and its subsidiary, Phoebe Putney Memorial\nHospital, Inc. (PPMH). The Authority leased Memorial to PPMH for $1\nper year for 40 years. Under the lease, PPMH has exclusive\nauthority over the operation of Memorial, including the ability to\nset rates for services. Consistent with \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7), PPMH is\nsubject to lease conditions that require provision of care to the\nindigent sick and limit its rate of return.Memorial is one of two hospitals in Dougherty\nCounty. The second, Palmyra Medical Center (Palmyra), was estab-\nlished in Albany in 1971 and is located just two miles from\nMemorial. At the time suit was brought in this case, Palmyra was\noperated by a national for-profit hospital network, HCA, Inc.\n(HCA). Together, Memorial and Palmyra account for 86 percent of the\nmarket for acute-care hospital services provided to commercial\nhealth care plans and their customers in the six counties\nsurrounding Al- bany. Memorial accounts for 75 percent of that\nmarket on its own.In 2010, PPHS began discussions with HCA about\nacquiring Palmyra. Following negotiations, PPHS presented the\nAuthority with a plan under which the Authority would purchase\nPalmyra with PPHS controlled funds and then lease Palmyra to a PPHS\nsubsidiary for $1 per year under the Memorial lease agreement. The\nAuthority unanimously approved the transaction.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shortly\nthere- after issued an administrative complaint alleging that the\nproposed purchase-and-lease transaction would create a virtual\nmonopoly and would substantially reduce competition in the market\nfor acute-care hospital services, in violation of \u00a75 of the Federal\nTrade Commission Act, 38Stat. 719, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a745, and\n\u00a77 of the Clayton Act, 38Stat. 731, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a718. The\nFTC, along with the State of Georgia,[1] subsequently filed suit against the Authority, HCA,\nPalmyra, PPHS, PPMH, and the new PPHS subsidiary created to manage\nPalmyra (collectively respondents), seeking to enjoin the\ntransaction pending administrative proceedings. See 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a726, 53(b).The United States District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Georgia denied the request for a preliminary injunction\nand granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. 793 F. Supp. 2d 1356\n(2011). The District Court held that respondents are immune from\nantitrust liability under the state-action doctrine.\nSeeid.,at 1366\u20131381.The United States Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed. 663 F.3d 1369 (2011). As an initial\nmatter, the court \u201cagree[d] with the [FTC] that, on the facts\nalleged, the joint operation of Memorial and Palmyra would\nsubstantially lessen competition or tend to create, if not create,\na monopoly.\u201dId.,at 1375. But the court con-cluded that the\ntransaction was immune from antitrust liability. Seeid.,at\n1375\u20131378. The Court of Appeals explained that as a local\ngovernmental entity, the Authority was entitled to state-action\nimmunity if the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018foreseeable result\u2019\u00a0\u201d of Georgia\u2019s legislation.Id., at 1375. According to the court, anticompetitive\nconduct is foreseeable if it could have been \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonably\nanticipated\u2019\u00a0\u201d by the state legislature; it is not necessary,\nthe court reasoned, for an anticompetitive effect to \u201c\u00a0be \u2018one\nthat ordinarily occurs, routinely occurs, or is inherently likely\nto occur as a result of the empowering legislation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 1375\u20131376 (quotingFTCv.Hospital Bd. of\nDirectors of Lee Cty.,38 F.3d 1184, 1188, 1190\u20131191 (CA11 1994)). Applying that\nstandard, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Law contemplated\nthe anticompetitive conduct challenged by the FTC. The court noted\nthe \u201cimpressive breadth\u201d of the powers given to hospital\nauthorities, which include traditional powers of private\ncorporations and a few additional capabilities, such as the power\nto exercise eminent domain. See 663 F.\u00a03d, at 1376. More\nspecifically, the court reasoned that the Georgia Legislature must\nhave anticipated that the grant of power to hospital authorities to\nacquire and lease projects would produce anticompetitive effects\nbecause \u201c[f]oreseeably, acquisitions could consolidate ownership of\ncompeting hospitals, eliminating competition between them.\u201dId.,at 1377.[2]The Court of Appeals also rejected the FTC\u2019s\nalternative argument that state-action immunity did not apply\nbecause the transaction in substance involved a transfer of control\nover Palmyra from one private entity to another, with the Authority\nacting as a mere conduit for the sale to evade antitrust liability.\nSeeid.,at 1376, n.\u00a012.We granted certiorari on two questions: whether\nthe Georgia Legislature, through the powers it vested in hospital\nauthorities, clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed a\nstate policy to displace competition in the market for hospital\nservices; and if so, whether state-action immunity is nonetheless\ninapplicable as a result of the Authority\u2019s minimal participation\nin negotiating the terms of the sale of Palymra and the Authority\u2019s\nlimited supervision of the two hospitals\u2019 operations. See 567\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2012). Concluding that the answer to the first\nquestion is \u201cno,\u201d we reverse without reaching the second\nquestion.[3]IIInParkerv.Brown,317 U.S.\n341(1943), this Court held that because \u201cnothing in the\nlanguage of the Sherman Act [ 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71et\u00a0seq.] or in its history\u201d suggested that Congress\nintended to restrict the sovereign capacity of the States to\nregulate their economies, the Act should not be read to bar States\nfrom imposing market restraints \u201cas an act of government.\u201dId.,at 350, 352. FollowingParker, we have held that\nunder certain circumstances, immunity from the federal antitrust\nlaws may extend to nonstate actors carrying out the State\u2019s\nregulatory program. SeePatrickv.Burget,486 U.S.\n94, 99\u2013100 (1988);Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference,\nInc.v.United States,471 U.S.\n48, 56\u201357 (1985).But given the fundamental national values of\nfree enterprise and economic competition that are embodied in the\nfederal antitrust laws, \u201cstate-action immunity is disfavored, much\nas are repeals by implication.\u201dFTCv.Ticor Title Ins.\nCo.,504 U.S.\n621, 636 (1992). Consistent with this preference, we recognize\nstate-action immunity only when it is clear that the challenged\nanticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to a regulatory\nscheme that \u201cis the State\u2019s own.\u201dId.,at 635. Accordingly,\n\u201c[c]loser analysis is required when the activity at issue is not\ndirectly that of\u201d the State itself, but rather \u201cis carried out by\nothers pursuant to state authorization.\u201dHooverv.Ronwin,466 U.S.\n558, 568 (1984).When determining whether the\nanticompetitive acts of private parties are entitled to immunity,\nwe employ a two-part test, requiring first that \u201cthe challenged\nrestraint .\u00a0. . be one clearly articu- lated and affirmatively\nexpressed as state policy,\u201d and second that \u201cthe policy . . . be\nactively supervised by the State.\u201dCalifornia Retail Liquor\nDealers Assn.v.Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,445 U.S.\n97, 105 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).This case involves allegedly anticompetitive\nconduct undertaken by a substate governmental entity. Because\nmunicipalities and other political subdivisions are not themselves\nsovereign, state-action immunity underParkerdoes not apply\nto them directly. SeeColumbiav.Omni Outdoor\nAdvertising, Inc.,499\nU.S. 365, 370 (1991);Lafay- ettev.Louisiana Power\n& Light Co.,435 U.S.\n389, 411\u2013413 (1978) (plurality opinion). At the same time,\nhowever, substate governmental entities do receive immunity from\nantitrust scrutiny when they act \u201cpursuant to state policy to\ndisplace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.\u201dId., at 413.[4] This\nrule \u201cpreserves to the States their freedom .\u00a0.\u00a0. to use\ntheir municipalities to administer state regulatory policies free\nof the inhibitions of the federal antitrust laws without at the\nsame time permitting purely parochial interests to disrupt the\nNation\u2019s free-market goals.\u201dId., at 415\u2013416.As with private parties, immunity will only\nattach to the activities of local governmental entities if they are\nundertaken pursuant to a \u201cclearly articulated and affirmatively\nexpressed\u201d state policy to displace competition.Community\nCommunications Co.v.Boulder,455 U.S.\n40, 52 (1982). But unlike private parties, such entities are\nnot subject to the \u201cactive state supervision requirement\u201d because\nthey have less of an incentive to pursue their own self-interest\nunder the guise of implementing state policies.Halliev.Eau Claire,471 U.S.\n34, 46\u201347 (1985).[5]\u201c[T]o pass the \u2018clear articulation\u2019 test,\u201d a\nstate legislature need not \u201cexpressly state in a statute or its\nlegislative history that the legislature intends for the delegated\naction to have anticompetitive effects.\u201dId.,at 43. Rather,\nwe explained inHalliethat state-action immunity applies if\nthe anticompetitive effect was the \u201c\u00a0foreseeable result\u201d of\nwhat the State authorized.Id., at 42. We applied that\nprinciple inOmni, where we concluded that the\nclear-articulation test was satisfied because the suppression of\ncompetition in the billboard market was the foreseeable result of a\nstate statute authorizing municipalities to adopt zoning ordinances\nregulating the construction of buildings and other structures. 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 373.IIIAApplying the clear-articulation test to the\nLaw before us, we conclude that respondents\u2019 claim for state-action\nimmunity fails because there is no evidence the State affirmatively\ncontemplated that hospital authorities would displace competition\nby consolidating hospital ownership. The acquisition and leasing\npowers exercised by the Authority in the challenged transaction,\nwhich were the principal powers relied upon by the Court of Appeals\nin finding state-action immunity, see 663 F.\u00a03d, at 1377,\nmirror general powers routinely conferred by state law upon private\ncorporations.[6] Other powers\npossessed by hospital authorities that the Court of Appeals\ncharacterized as having \u201cimpressive breadth,\u201did., at 1376,\nalso fit this pattern, including the ability to make and execute\ncontracts, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(3), to set rates for services, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(10), to\nsue and be sued, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(1), to borrow money, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(17), and\nthe residual authority to exercise any or all powers possessed by\nprivate corporations, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(21).Our case law makes clear that state-law\nauthority to act is insufficient to establish state-action\nimmunity; the substate governmental entity must also show that it\nhas been delegated authority to act or regulate anticompetitively.\nSeeOmni, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 372. InBoulder, we held\nthat Colorado\u2019s Home Rule Amendment allowing municipalities to\ngovern local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test.\n455 U.\u00a0S., at 55\u201356. There was no doubt in that case that the\ncity had authority as a matter of state law to pass an ordinance\nimposing a moratorium on a cable provider\u2019s expansion of service.Id.,at 45\u201346. But we rejected the proposition that \u201cthe\ngeneral grant of power to enact ordinances necessarily implies\nstate authorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances\u201d\nbecause such an approach \u201cwould wholly eviscerate the concepts of\n\u2018clear articulation and affirmative expression\u2019 that our precedents\nrequire.\u201dId.,at 56. We explained that when a State\u2019s\nposition \u201cis one of mereneutralityrespecting the municipal\nactions challenged as anticompetitive,\u201d the State cannot be said to\nhave \u201c\u00a0\u2018contemplated\u2019\u00a0\u201d those anticompetitive actions.Id.,at 55.The principle articulated inBouldercontrols this case. Grants of general corporate power that allow\nsubstate governmental entities to participate in a competitive\nmarketplace should be, can be, and typically are used in ways that\nraise no federal antitrust concerns. As a result, a State that has\ndelegated such general powers \u201ccan hardly be said to have\n\u2018contemplated\u2019\u00a0\u201d that they will be used anticompetitively.Ibid. See also 1A P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust\nLaw \u00b6225a, p. 131 (3d ed. 2006) (hereinafter Areeda &\nHovenkamp) (\u201cWhen a state grants power to an inferior entity, it\npresumably grants the power to do the thing contemplated, but not\nto do so anticompetitively\u201d). Thus, while the Law does allow the\nAuthority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and\naffirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to\nmake acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially\nlessen competition.BIn concluding otherwise, and specifically in\nreasoning that the Georgia Legislature \u201cmust have anticipated\u201d that\nacquisitions by hospital authorities \u201cwould produce anticompetitive\neffects,\u201d 663 F.\u00a03d, at 1377, the Court of Appeals applied the\nconcept of \u201cforeseeability\u201d from our clear-articulation test too\nloosely.InHallie, we recognized that it would\n\u201cembod[y] an unrealistic view of how legislatures work and of how\nstatutes are written\u201d to require state legislatures to explicitly\nauthorize specific anticompetitive effects before state-action\nimmunity could apply. 471 U.\u00a0S., at 43. \u201cNo legislature,\u201d we\nexplained, \u201ccan be expected to catalog all of the anticipated\neffects\u201d of a statute delegating authority to a substate\ngovernmental entity.Ibid.Instead, we have approached\nthe clear-articulation inquiry more practically, but without\ndiluting the ultimate requirement that the State must have\naffirmatively contemplated the displacement of competition such\nthat the challenged anticompetitive effects can be attributed to\nthe \u201cstate itself.\u201dParker, 317 U.\u00a0S., at 352. Thus, we\nhave concluded that a state policy to displace federal antitrust\nlaw was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of\ncompetition was the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the\nexercise of authority delegated by the state legislature. In that\nscenario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the\nanticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.For example, inHallie, Wisconsin\nstatutory law regulating the municipal provision of sewage services\nexpressly permitted cities to limit their service to surrounding\nunincorporated areas. See 471 U.\u00a0S., at 41. While\nunincorporated towns alleged that the city\u2019s exercise of that power\nconstituted an unlawful tying arrangement, an unlawful refusal to\ndeal, and an abuse of monopoly power, we had no trouble concluding\nthat these alleged anticompetitive effects were affirmatively\ncontemplated by the State because it was \u201cclear\u201d that they\n\u201clogically would result\u201d from the grant of authority.Id.,\nat 42. As described by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the state\nlegislature \u201c\u00a0\u2018viewed annexation by the city of a surrounding\nunincorporated area as a reasonablequid pro quothat a city\ncould require before extending sewer services to the area.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 44\u201345, n.\u00a08 (quotingHalliev.Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 540\u2013541,314 N.W.2d 321, 325 (1982)). Without immunity, federal\nantitrust law could have undermined that arrangement and taken\ncompletely off the table the policy option that the State clearly\nintended for cities to have.Similarly, inOmni, where the respondents\nalleged that the city had used its zoning power to protect an\nincumbent billboard provider against competition, we found that the\nclear-articulation test was easily satisfied even though the state\nstatutes delegating zoning authority to the city did not explicitly\npermit the suppression of competition. We explained that \u201c[t]he\nvery purpose of zoning regulation is to displace unfettered\nbusiness freedom in a manner that regularly has the effect of\npreventing normal acts of competition\u201d and that a zoning ordinance\nregulating the size, location, and spacing of billboards\n\u201cnecessarily protects existing billboards against some competition\nfrom newcomers.\u201d 499 U.\u00a0S., at 373. Other cases in which we\nhave found a \u201cclear articulation\u201d of the State\u2019s intent to displace\ncompetition without an explicit statement have also involved\nauthorizations to act or regulate in ways that were inherently\nanticompetitive.[7]By contrast, \u201csimple permission to play in a\nmarket\u201d does not \u201cforeseeably entail permission to roughhouse in\nthat market unlawfully.\u201dKay Elec. Cooperativev.Newkirk, 647 F.3d 1039, 1043 (CA10 2011). When a State\ngrants some entity general power to act, whether it is a private\ncorporation or a public entity like the Authority, it does so\nagainst the backdrop of federal antitrust law. SeeTicor\nTitle, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 632. Of course, both private parties\nand local governmental entities conceivably may transgress\nantitrust requirements by exercising their general powers in\nanticompetitive ways. But a reasonable legislature\u2019s ability to\nanticipate that (potentially undesirable) possibility falls well\nshort of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to\ndisplace competition with a regulatory alternative.Believing that this case falls within the scope\nof the foreseeability standard applied inHallieandOmni, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[i]t defies\nimagination to suppose the [state] legislature could have believed\nthat every geographic market in Georgia was so replete with\nhospitals that authorizing acquisitions by the authorities could\nhave no serious anticompetitive consequences.\u201d 663 F.\u00a03d, at\n1377. Respondents echo this argument, noting that each of Georgia\u2019s\n159 counties covers a small geographical area and that most of them\nare sparsely populated, with nearly three-quarters having fewer\nthan 50,000 residents as of the 2010 Census. Brief for Respondents\n46.Even accepting,arguendo, the premise\nthat facts about a market could make the anticompetitive use of\ngeneral corporate powers \u201cforeseeable,\u201d we reject the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 conclusion because only a relatively\nsmall subset of the conduct permitted as a matter of state law by\nGa. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4) has the potential to negatively affect\ncompetition. Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019\ncharacterization, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4) is not principally concerned with\nhospital authorities\u2019 ability to acquire multiple hospitals and\nconsolidate their operations. Section 31\u20137\u201375(4) allows authorities\nto acquire \u201cprojects,\u201d which includes not only \u201chospitals,\u201d but\nalso \u201chealth care facilities, dormitories, office buildings,\nclinics, housing accommodations, nursing homes, rehabilitation\ncenters, extended care facilities, and other public health\nfacilities.\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201371(5). Narrowing our focus to the market for\nhospital services, the power to acquire hospitals still does not\nordinarily produce anticompetitive effects. Section 31\u20137\u201375(4) was,\nafter all, the source of power for newly formed hospital\nauthorities to acquire a hospital in the first instance\u2014a\ntransaction that was unlikely to raise any antitrust concerns even\nin small markets because the transfer of ownership from private to\npublic hands does not increase market concentration. See 1A Areeda\n& Hovenkamp \u00b6224e(c), at 126 (\u201c[S]ubstitution of one monopolist\nfor another is not an antitrust violation\u201d). While subsequent\nacquisitions by authorities have the potential to reduce\ncompetition, they will raise federal antitrust concerns only in\nmarkets that are large enough to support more than one hospital but\nsufficiently small that the merger of competitors would lead to a\nsignificant increase in market concentration. This is too slender a\nreed to support the Court of Appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019\ninference.IVATaking a somewhat different approach than the\nCourt of Appeals, respondents insist that the Law should not be\nread as a mere authorization for hospital authorities to\nparticipate in the hospital-services market and exercise general\ncorporate powers. Rather, they contend that hos- pital authorities\nare granted unique powers and respon- sibilities to fulfill the\nState\u2019s objective of providing all residents with access to\nadequate and affordable health and hospital care. See,e.g.,Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375(22). Respondents argue that in view of\nhospital authorities\u2019 statutory objective, their specific\nattributes, and the regulatory context in which they operate, it\nwas foreseeable that authorities facing capacity constraints would\ndecide they could best serve their communities\u2019 needs by acquiring\nan existing local hospital rather than incur the additional expense\nand regulatory burden of expanding a facility or constructing a new\none. See\u00a0Brief for Respondents 33\u201339.In support of this argument, respondents observe\nthat hospital authorities are simultaneously empowered to act in\nways private entities cannot while also being subject to\nsignificant regulatory constraints. On the power side, as the Court\nof Appeals noted, 663 F.\u00a03d, at 1376\u20131377, hospital\nauthorities may acquire through eminent domain property that is\n\u201cessential to the [authority\u2019s] purposes.\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201375(12).[8] On the restraint side, hospital\nauthorities are managed by a publicly accountable board,\n\u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201374.1, 31\u20137\u201376, they must operate on a nonprofit basis,\n\u00a731\u20137\u201377, and they may only lease a project for others to operate\nafter determining that doing so will promote the community\u2019s public\nhealth needs and that the lessee will not receive more than a\nreasonable rate of return on its investment, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7). Moreover,\nhospital authorities operate within a broader regulatory context in\nwhich Georgia requires any party seeking to establish or\nsignificantly expand certain medical facilities, including\nhospitals, to obtain a certificate of need from state regulators.\nSee \u00a731\u20136\u201340et\u00a0seq.[9]We have no doubt that Georgia\u2019s hospital\nauthorities differ materially from private corporations that offer\nhospital services. But nothing in the Law or any other provision of\nGeorgia law clearly articulates a state policy to allow authorities\nto\u00a0exercise their general corporate powers, including their\nacquisition power, without regard to negative effects on\ncompetition. The state legislature\u2019s objective of improving access\nto affordable health care does not logically suggest that the State\nintended that hospital authorities pursue that end through mergers\nthat create monopolies. Nor do the restrictions imposed on hospital\nauthorities, including the requirement that they operate on a\nnonprofit basis, reveal such a policy. Particularly in light of our\nnational policy favoring competition, these restrictions should be\nread to reflect more modest aims. The legislature may have viewed\nprofit generation as incompatible with its goal of providing care\nfor the indigent sick. In addition, the legislature may have\nbelieved that some hospital authorities would operate in markets\nwith characteristics of natural monopolies, in which case the\nlegislature could not rely on competition to control prices. SeeCantorv.Detroit Edison Co.,428\nU.S. 579, 595\u2013596 (1976).We recognize that Georgia, particularly through\nits certificate of need requirement, does limit competition in the\nmarket for hospital services in some respects. But regulation of an\nindustry, and even the authorization of discrete forms of\nanticompetitive conduct pursuant to a regulatory structure, does\nnot establish that the State has affirmatively contemplated other\nforms of anticompetitive conduct that are only tangentially\nrelated. Thus, inGoldfarbv.Virginia State Bar,421 U.S.\n773(1975), we re- jected a state-action defense to\nprice-fixing claims where a state bar adopted a compulsory minimum\nfee schedule. Although the State heavily regulated the practice of\nlaw, we found no evidence that it had adopted a policy to displace\nprice competition among lawyers.Id., at 788\u2013792. And inCantor, we concluded that a state commission\u2019s regulation of\nrates for electricity charged by a public utility did not confer\nstate-action immunity for a claim that the utility\u2019s free\ndistribution of light bulbs restrained trade in the light-bulb\nmarket. 428 U.\u00a0S., at 596.In this case, the fact that Georgia imposes\nlimits on entry into the market for medical services, which apply\nto both hospital authorities and private corporations, does not\nclearly articulate a policy favoring the consolidation of existing\nhospitals that are engaged in active competition. Accord,FTCv.University Health, Inc., 938 F.2d 1206, 1213,\nn.\u00a013 (CA11 1991). As to the Authority\u2019s eminent domain power,\nit was not exercised here and we do not find it relevant to the\nquestion whether the State authorized hospital authorities to\nconsolidate market power through potentially anticompetitive\nacquisitions of existing hospitals.BFinally, respondents contend that to the\nextent there is any doubt about whether the clear-articulation test\nis satisfied in this context, federal courts should err on the side\nof recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state\npolicy choices. See Brief for Respondents 43\u201344. But we do not find\nthe Law ambiguous on the question whether it clearly articulates a\npolicy authorizing anticompetitive acquisitions; it does not.More fundamentally, respondents\u2019 suggestion is\ninconsistent with the principle that \u201cstate-action immunity is\ndisfavored.\u201dTicor Title, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 636.Parkerand its progeny are premised on an understanding that\nrespect for the States\u2019 coordinate role in government counsels\nagainst reading the federal antitrust laws to restrict the States\u2019\nsovereign capacity to regulate their economies and provide services\nto their citizens. But federalism and state sovereignty are poorly\nserved by a rule of construction that would allow \u201cessential\nnational policies\u201d embodied in the antitrust laws to be displaced\nby state delegations of authority \u201cintended to achieve more limited\nends.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S., at 636. As anamicibrief filed by 20\nStates in support of the FTC contends, loose application of the\nclear-articulation test would attach significant unintended\nconsequences to States\u2019 frequent delegations of corporate authority\nto local bodies, effectively requiring States to disclaim any\nintent to displace competition to avoid inadvertently authorizing\nanticompetitive conduct.

We decline to set such a trap for unwary\nstate legislatures.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We hold that Georgia has not clearly\narticulated and affirmatively expressed a policy to allow hospital\nauthorities to make acquisitions that substantially lessen\ncompetition. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Georgia did not join the\nnotice of appeal filed by the FTC and is no longer a party in the\ncase.2In tension with the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 decision, other Circuits have held in analogous\ncircumstances that substate governmental entities exercising\ngeneral corporate powers were not entitled to state-action\nimmunity.

The\ncase is not moot, however, because the District Court on remand\ncould enjoin respondents from taking actions that would disturb the\nstatus quo and impede a final remedial decree.

Because this argument was not raised\nby the parties or passed on by the lower courts, we do not consider\nit.United Parcel Service, Inc.v.Mitchell,451 U.S.\n56, 60, n. 2 (1981).5The Eleventh Circuit has\nheld that while Georgia\u2019s hospital authorities are \u201cunique\nentities\u201d that lie \u201csomewhere between a local, general-purpose\ngoverning body (such as a city or county) and a corporation,\u201d they\nqualify as \u201can instrumentality, agency, or \u2018political subdivision\u2019\nof Georgia for purposes of state action immunity.\u201dCrosbyv.Hospital Auth. of Valdosta & Lowndes Cty.,93 F.3d 1515, 1524\u20131526 (1996). The FTC has not challenged that\ncharacterization of Georgia\u2019s hospital authorities, and we\naccordingly operate from the assumption that hos-pital authorities\nare akin to political subdivisions.6Compare Ga. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201375(4), (7) (2012) (authorizing hospital authorities to\nacquire projects and enter lease agreements), with \u00a714\u20132\u2013302\n(outlining general powers of private corporations in Georgia, which\ninclude the ability to acquire and lease property), \u00a714\u20132\u20131101\n(allowing corporate mergers), and \u00a7\u00a714\u20132\u20131201, 14\u20132\u20131202 (allowing\nsales of corporate assets to other corporations).7SeeSouthern Motor\nCarriers Rate Conference, Inc.v.United States,471 U.S.\n48, 64, 65, and n. 25 (1985) (finding that a state commission\u2019s\ndecision to encourage collective ratemaking by common carriers was\nentitled to state-action immunity where the legislature had left\n\u201c[t]he details of the inherently anticompetitive rate-setting\nprocess .\u00a0.\u00a0. tothe agency\u2019s discretion\u201d);Halliev.Eau Claire,471 U.S.\n34, 42 (1985) (describingNew Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal.v.Orrin W.

Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201384, which provides that hospital\nauthorities do not have the power to assess taxes, but allows the\napplicable governing body in the authority\u2019s area of operation to\nimpose taxes to cover the authority\u2019s expenses. See 663 F.\u00a03d,\nat 1377. This provision applies in cases in which the county or\nmunicipality has entered into a contract with a hospital authority\nfor the use of its facilities. See \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201384(a), 31\u20137\u201385. No such\ncontract exists in this case, and respondents have not relied on\nthis provision in briefing or argument before us.9Georgia first adopted\ncertificate of need legislation in 1978 in part to comply with a\nsince-repealed federal law conditioning federal funding for a\nnumber of health care programs on a State\u2019s enactment of\ncertificate of need laws. See 1978 Ga. Laws p. 941, as amended, Ga.\nCode Ann. \u00a731\u20136\u201340et seq.(2012); see also National Health\nPlanning and Resources Development Act of 1974, 88Stat. 2246,\nrepealed by \u00a7701(a), 100Stat. 3799.
