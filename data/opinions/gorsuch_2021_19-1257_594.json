Our cases have assumed\u2014without\ndeciding\u2014that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 furnishes an implied\ncause of action under \u00a72. SeeMobilev.Bolden,446 U.S.\n55, 60, and n.\u00a08 (1980) (plurality opinion). Lower courts\nhave treated this as an open question.E.g.,Washingtonv.Finlay, 664 F.2d 913, 926 (CA4 1981).\nBecause no party argues that the plaintiffs lack a cause of action\nhere, and because the existence (or not) of a cause of action does\nnot go to a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, seeReyes\nMatav.Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, 150 (2015), this Court need\nnot and does not address that issue today.",
