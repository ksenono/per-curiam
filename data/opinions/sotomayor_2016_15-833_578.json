In this case, the parties agree that a California\nSuperior Court denied a petition for improper venue because it was\nfiled in the wrong county. The California Supreme Court later\ndenied the same petition for no explained reason. ApplyingYlst\u2019s commonsense presumption, it is \u201cmost improbable\u201d that\nthe California Supreme Court\u2019s unexplained order disagreed with the\nSuperior Court\u2019s reasoned order.Id.,at 804. We should\ntherefore presume that the California Supreme Court denied Antonio\nHinojosa\u2019s habeas petition because he filed the first one in the\nwrong county.The Court, however, believes there isstrongevidence to the contrary\u2014for two inexplicable\nreasons. The first reason\u2014the California Supreme Court could not\nhave denied the petition for \u201cimproper venue\u201d because there is only\none California Supreme Court,ante,at 3\u2014is a straw man, and\na poorly constructed one at that. Obviously the California Supreme\nCourt did not deny Hinojosa\u2019s petition because he filed it in the\nwrong State Supreme Court. But it easily could have denied his\npetition because it agreed with the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat he filed the first petition in the wrong county. SeeIn\u00a0re Steele, 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P.\u00a03d 444,\n449 (2004). That possibility becomes even more likely in light of\nCalifornia\u2019s atypical habeas rules, which treat an original habeas\npetition to the California Supreme Court as the commonplace method\nfor seeking review of a lower court\u2019s order. SeeCareyv.Saffold, 536 U. S. 214 \u2013222 (2002).[1]* By issuing a silent order after reviewing the lower\ncourt\u2019s reasoned decision, the California Supreme Court presumably\ndenied Hinojosa\u2019s petition on the same ground. Cf.Ylst, 501\nU.\u00a0S., at 800 (applying its presumption on an identical\nposture out of California).The majority\u2019s second reason is even flimsier.\nThe majority suggests that the California Supreme Court\u2019s order did\nnot include the words \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and therefore could not\nhave agreed with the Superior Court\u2019s denial\u2014which the majority\nassumes was without prejudice.Ante, at 4. But as the\nmajority quotes, the Superior Court simply \u201c\u00a0\u2018DENIED\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthe petition; neither it nor the California Supreme Court \u201cDENIED\u201d\nit \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201dAnte,at 2, 4. It is mindboggling\nhow one opinion necessarily disagrees with another opinion merely\nbecause it omits language that the other opinion also lacks.I would hold, as the Ninth Circuit did, that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court presumably agreed with the reasoning of\nthe Superior Court. SeeYlst, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 804. At the\nvery least, I would not hold that there is such \u201cstrongevidence\u201d to the contrary that we should summarily reverse the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the California Supreme Court\u2019s\norder\u2014and, in the process, reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s separate\nconclusion that Hinojosa\u2019s incarceration had been\nunconstitutionally extended.Notes1*\u00a0Contrary to the\nmajority\u2019s characterization, Hinojosa did not file his petition\n\u201c[i]nstead of appealing\u201d the lower court\u2019s denial,ante, at\n2\u2014his petition was itself his appeal. SeeCarey, 536\nU.\u00a0S., at 225 (calling an original habeas petition and the\nalternative \u201cpetition for hearing\u201d \u201cinterchangeable\u201d methods\nof appeal, \u201cwith neither option bringing adverse consequences to\nthe petitioner\u201d).",
