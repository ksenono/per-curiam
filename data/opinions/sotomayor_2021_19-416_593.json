I\ndo not, however, join Justice Thomas\u2019 alternative path to that\ndisposition, which would overruleSosav.Alvarez-Machain,542 U.S.\n692(2004), in all but name. The First Congress enacted the ATS\nto ensure that federal courts are available to foreign citizens who\nsuffer international law violations for which other nations may\nexpect the United States to provide a forum for redress. Justice\nThomas would limit the ATS\u2019 reach to only the three international\nlaw torts that were recognized in 1789. That reading contravenes\nboth this Court\u2019s express holding inSosaand the text and\nhistory of the ATS.IAIncluded in the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS\ngave federal courts \u201ccognizance .\u00a0.\u00a0. of all causes where\nan alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or\na treaty of the United States.\u201d Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a79, 1Stat.\n77. The ATS does not list the torts that fall within its purview.\nRather, the statute was \u201c\u00a0\u2018enacted on the understanding that\n[federal] common law would provide a cause of action for [a] modest\nnumber of international law violations.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKiobelv.Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,569 U.S.\n108, 115 (2013) (quotingSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 724;\nsome alterations in original). Three such torts were \u201cprobably on\nminds of the men who drafted the ATS\u201d: \u201cviolation of safe conducts,\ninfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\u201dId.,\nat 715 (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n68 (1769)).Unsurprisingly, the domestic and international\nlegal landscape has changed in the two centuries since Congress\nenacted the ATS. On the one hand, this Court inErie R. Co.v.Tompkins,304 U.S.\n64(1938), \u201cdenied the existence of any federal \u2018general\u2019\ncommon law.\u201dSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 726 (quoting 304\nU.\u00a0S., at 78).Eriethus foiled the First Congress\u2019\nexpectation \u201cthat the common law would,\u201d of its own accord,\n\u201cprovide a cause of action for the modest number of international\nlaw violations,\u201d 542 U.\u00a0S., at 724, that qualify as\n\u201ctort[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. in violation of the law of nations,\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350. On the other hand, the class of\nlaw-of-nations torts has grown \u201cwith the evolving recognition\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that certain acts constituting crimes against\nhumanity are in violation of basic precepts of international law.\u201dJesnerv.Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2018) (slip op., at 9). Like the pirates of the 18th century,\ntoday\u2019s torturers, slave traders, and perpetrators of genocide are\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018hostis humani generis, an enemy of all\nmankind.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 732.The Court reconciled these two legal\ndevelopments inSosav.Alvarez-Machain. There, the\nCourt explained that it would \u201cbe unreasonable to assume that the\nFirst Congress would have expected federal courts to lose all\ncapacity to recognize enforceable international norms simply\nbecause the common law might lose some metaphysical cachet\u201d in a\npost-Erieworld. 542 U.\u00a0S., at 730. Indeed, whileErierejected the notion of a general federal common law,\nthe \u201cpost-Erieunderstanding has identified limited enclaves\nin which federal courts may derive some substantive law in a common\nlaw way.\u201d 542 U.\u00a0S., at 729. For over 200 years (both\nbefore and afterErie), courts have adhered to the principle\nthat \u201cthe domestic law of the United States recognizes the law of\nnations.\u201d[1] 542 U.\u00a0S., at\n729.WhileSosarefused to \u201cclose the door\u201d to\n\u201cjudicial recognition of actionable international norms,\u201d it\nremains \u201csubject to vigilant doorkeeping.\u201dIbid.Sosaexplained that \u201ccourts should require any claim based on the\npresent-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international\ncharacter accepted by the civilized world and defined with a\nspecificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century\nparadigms\u201d contemplated by the First Congress (i.e.,norms\nregarding safe conducts, the rights of ambassadors, and piracy).Id.,at 725. The Court elaborated that \u201cthe determination\nwhether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of\naction should (and, indeed, inevitably must) involve an element of\njudgment about the practical consequences of making that cause\navailable to litigants in the federal courts.\u201dId.,at\n732\u2013733 (footnote omitted).In the years since, this Court has readSosato announce a two-step test for recognizing the\navailability of a cause of action under the ATS. Courts first ask\n\u201cwhether a plaintiff can demonstrate that the alleged violation is\n\u2018of a norm that is specific, universal, and obligatory.\u2019\u00a0\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (plurality opinion) (slip\nop., at 11\u201312) (quotingSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 732). If\nso, then \u201cit must be determined further whether allowing [a] case\nto proceed under the ATS is a proper exercise of judicial\ndiscretion.\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12).BJustice Thomas readsSosaand this\nCourt\u2019s subsequent precedents to impose an \u201cextraordinarily strict\u201d\nstandard atSosa\u2019s second step.Ante,at 8. If a\ncourt \u201ccan identify even one \u2018sound reaso[n]\u2019\u00a0\u201d to think\nCongress might doubt the need for a cause of action under the ATS,\nwe are told, the court should refuse to recognize it.Ibid.(quotingJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (majority opinion)\n(slip op., at 18); some internal quotation marks omitted).The trouble with Justice Thomas\u2019 test is that it\nis unmoored from both history and precedent. The ATS was a statute\nborn of necessity. In the early days of the Republic, the\n\u201cContinental Congress was hamstrung by its inability\u201d under the\nArticles of Confederation \u201cto \u2018cause infractions of treaties, or of\nthe law of nations to be punished.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSosa, 542\nU.\u00a0S., at 716 (quoting J. Madison, Journal of the\nConstitutional Convention 60 (E. Scott ed. 1893)). The United\nStates\u2019 failure to redress such offenses \u201ccaused substantial\nforeign-relations problems,\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 7), and \u201cthreaten[ed] serious consequences in\ninternational affairs,\u201dSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 715. On\nmore than one occasion (and in no uncertain terms), foreign powers\nexpressed their displeasure with the United States\u2019 failure to\nprovide redress for law-of-nations violations against their\ncitizens.[2] SeeJesner,\n584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7); see alsoKiobel,\n569 U.\u00a0S., at 120;Sosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 716\u2013717,\nand n.\u00a011. Congress\u2019 \u201cprincipal objective\u201d in establishing\nfederal jurisdiction over such torts, therefore, \u201cwas to avoid\nforeign entanglements by ensuring the availability of a federal\nforum where the failure to provide one might cause another nation\nto hold the United States responsible for an injury to a foreign\ncitizen.\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n8\u20139).As this Court explained inSosa, \u201c[t]he\nanxieties of the preconstitutional period cannot be ignored easily\nenough to think that the [ATS] was not meant to have a practical\neffect.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 542 U.\u00a0S., at 719. It was Congress\u2019 assessment\nthat diplomatic strife is best avoided by providing a federal forum\nto redress those law-of-nations torts that, if not remedied, could\nbring international opprobrium upon the United States. Because the\nFirst Congress did not pass \u201cthe ATS only to leave it lying fallow\nindefinitely,\u201d the statute \u201cis best read as having been enacted on\nthe understanding that the common law would provide a cause of\naction\u201d for widely recognized torts in violation of the law of\nnations.Id.,at 719, 724; see alsoJesner, 584\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[T]he [ATS] was not enacted\nto sit on a shelf awaiting further legislation\u201d). In other words,\nfrom the moment the ATS became law, Congress expected federal\ncourts to identify actionable torts under international law and to\nprovide injured plaintiffs with a forum to seek redress.That historical fact must guide jurists when\ndetermining \u201cwhether allowing [a] case to proceed under the ATS is\na proper exercise of judicial discretion.\u201dId., at ___\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 12). Justice Thomas suggests that\ncourts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS only \u201cin very\nlimited circumstances,\u201d if at all.Ante,at 5. But the ATS\ncalls for much more. The First Congress made the legislative\ndetermination that a remedy should be available under the ATS to\nforeign citizens who suffer \u201ctort[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. in violation\nof the law of nations.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350. Barring some\nextraordinary collateral consequence that could not have been\nforeseen by Congress, federal courts should not, under the guise of\njudicial discretion, second-guess that legislative decision.Justice Thomas therefore errs in asserting that\ncourts \u201cplac[e] great stress on the separation of powers\u201d when they\nrecognize causes of action under the ATS.Ante,at 7. That\nwould be news to the First Congress, which from the beginning\ncounted on federal courts to \u201crecognize enforceable international\nnorms\u201d in order to give the ATS \u201cpractical effect.\u201dSosa,\n542 U.\u00a0S., at 719, 730. To now suggest that identifying\nactionable torts \u201crisks \u2018upset[ting] the careful balance of\ninterests struck by the lawmakers\u2019\u00a0\u201d is ahistorical at best.Ante,at 8 (quotingHern\u00e1ndezv.Mesa, 589\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 5); brackets in\noriginal).Indeed, one need look no further than the text\nof the ATS to understand the task that the First Congress assigned\nto the Federal Judiciary. As originally enacted, the ATS gave\nfederal courts \u201ccognizance .\u00a0.\u00a0. of all causes where an\nalien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or a\ntreaty of the United States.\u201d \u00a79, 1Stat. 77. Congress did not need\nto legislate those \u201ccauses\u201d into existence because international\nlaw supplied the substantive contours of actionable torts, and\ndomestic law indisputably incorporated international law. SeeSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 729. Neither of those premises\nchanged afterErie. Justice Thomas thus misconceives the\njudicial task in asking whether courts may \u201ccreate\u201d causes of\naction under the ATS.Ante,at 6; see alsopost,at\n4\u20135 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). The assignment is much more modest:\nCourts must, based on their interpretation of international law,\nidentify those norms that are so specific, universal, and\nobligatory that they give rise to a \u201ctort\u201d for which Congress\nexpects federal courts to entertain \u201ccauses\u201d\u2014or, in modern\nparlance, \u201ccivil action[s],\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350\u2014for\nredress.Implicitly acknowledging his departure fromSosa, Justice Thomas argues that \u201cprecedents sinceSosahave substantially narrowed the circumstances in which\n\u2018judicial discretion\u2019\u00a0\u201d to recognize ATS causes of action \u201cis\npermitted.\u201dAnte,at 11. But the case on which he\nprincipally relies,Hern\u00e1ndezv.Mesa, 589 U.\u00a0S.\n___, is wholly inapposite.Hern\u00e1ndezcautions that \u201cfinding\nthat a damages remedy is implied by a provision that makes no\nreference to that remedy may upset the careful balance of interests\nstruck by the lawmakers.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 5). The\nATS, however, is not a statute that \u201cmakes no reference to [a]\nremedy.\u201dIbid.Just the opposite: The ATS expressly\ncontemplates that federal courts will hear \u201ccivil action[s]\u201d for\n\u201ctort[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. committed in violation of the law of\nnations.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350. As such, \u201ca federal court\u2019s\nauthority to recognize a damages remedy\u201d under the ATS very much\n\u201crest[s] at bottom on a statute enacted by Congress.\u201d[3]Hern\u00e1ndez, 589 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 6). Respect for the separation of powers is hardly\nserved by refusing a legislatively assigned task.IIApplying the wrong standard atSosa\u2019s\nsecond step, Justice Thomas reaches the wrong answer. He announces\nthat, except for \u201cthe three historical torts likely on the mind of\nthe First Congress,\u201d \u201cthere always is a sound reason\u201d for courts to\nrefuse to recognize actionable torts under the ATS.[4]Ante,at 11. He offers three\nreasons for this dramatic curtailment of the ATS. None is\npersuasive.First, Justice Thomas argues that \u201ccreating a\ncause of action to enforce international law beyond three\nhistorical torts invariably gives rise to foreign-policy concerns.\u201dAnte,at 9. He offers no meaningful support for that\nsweeping assertion, nor does he explain why an ATS suit for the\ntort of piracy, for example, would categorically present fewer\nforeign-policy concerns than a suit for aiding and abetting child\nslavery. That said, Justice Thomas is correct insofar as he\nobserves that, in some subset of cases, the diplomatic costs of\nallowing an ATS suit to proceed may outweigh the benefits of\nproviding redress to an injured foreign citizen. \u201c[W]hen\ninternational friction\u201d does arise, however, \u201ca court should\nrespond with the doctrine that speaks directly to the friction\u2019s\nsource.\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 22). Such tools include the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality, limits on personal jurisdiction,\ncase-by-case deference to the political branches, and the doctrines\nof exhaustion,forum non conveniens, and international\ncomity. Seeibid.;Kiobel, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 133\n(Breyer, J., concurring in judgment);Sosa, 542 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 733, n.\u00a021. Ignoring all these options, Justice Thomas\nwould instead bar any ATS suit that seeks to hold a defendant\nliable for violating any international norm that developed after\nthe 18th century. That is a gross overreaction to a manageable (and\nlargely hypothetical) problem.Moreover, in arguing that ATS litigation\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018inherent[ly]\u2019 raises \u2018foreign-policy concerns,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante,at 9 (quotingJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(majority opinion) (slip op., at 19)), Justice Thomas ignores the\nother side of the equation: that foreign nations may take (and,\nindeed, historically have taken) umbrage at the United States\u2019\nrefusal to provide redress to their citizens for international law\ntorts committed by U. S. nationals within the United States. Seesupra,at 4, and n.\u00a02. Closing the courthouse doors\nthus \u201cgives rise to foreign-policy concerns\u201d just as \u201cinvariably,\u201dante,at 9, as leaving them open.Second, Justice Thomas suggests that federal\ncourts lack \u201cthe \u2018institutional capacity\u2019 to consider all factors\nrelevant\u201d to recognizing actionable torts under the ATS.Ante,at 10; see alsopost,at 5\u20136 (opinion of\nGorsuch, J.). It would be surprising (and, I suspect, distressing)\nto the Congress that enacted the ATS to learn that federal courts\nlack institutional capacity to do the very thing the ATS presumes\nthey will do. Justice Thomas\u2019 pessimism aside, there is no reason\nto doubt federal courts\u2019 ability to identify those norms of\ninternational law that are sufficiently \u201c\u00a0\u2018specific,\nuniversal, and obligatory\u2019\u00a0\u201d to give rise to a cause of action\nunder the ATS.Jesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 12) (quotingSosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at\n732). After all, \u201c[f]or two centuries\u201d this Court has \u201caffirmed\nthat the domestic law of the United States recognizes the law of\nnations.\u201dId., at 729. There is nothing so mysterious about\na law\u2019s international origins that would prevent courts\u2014bodies\nspecifically tasked with, and particularly capable of, interpreting\nand applying laws\u2014from ably adjudicating a suit for damages arising\nout of a \u201ctort .\u00a0.\u00a0. committed in violation of the law of\nnations.\u201d[5] 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350.Finally, pointing to the Trafficking Victims\nProtection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), Justice Thomas argues that\nCongress\u2019 decision to impose criminal and civil liability on human\ntraffickers indicates that \u201cCongress might doubt\u201d the wisdom of\nrecognizing a cause of action for torts other than the violation of\nsafe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and\npiracy.Ante,at 9. It is hard to understand why that would\nbe true. That Congress has chosen to legislate against certain\nabhorrent conduct does not make that conduct any less tortious\nunder international law. Nor does it increase the likelihood that\nnegative \u201cpractical consequences\u201d will arise from allowing foreign\ncitizens to hold defendants liable for their torts under the ATS.Sosa, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 732. On the contrary, the fact that\nCongress authorized victims of slavery to sue perpetrators under\nthe TVPRA provides strong evidence that Congress would not, in\nfact, doubt the efficacy of permitting victims of slavery to sue\nperpetrators under the ATS (insofar as the plaintiffs seek a\ndomestic application of the statute).Justice Thomas replies that, because the TVPRA\nis not \u201ca retroactive statute,\u201d entertaining respondents\u2019 suit\nwould \u201cimpermissibly second-guess Congress\u2019 decision not to subject\npast conduct to a new standard.\u201dAnte,at 10. Surely Justice\nThomas does not mean that the prohibition against child slavery is\na \u201cnew standard.\u201d Nor is it tenable to argue that, at the time\nrespondents were enslaved on Ivorian cocoa farms, international law\npermitted the aiding and abetting of forced labor.[6] Perhaps Justice Thomas means to argue\nthat, by adding a cause of action to the TVPRA in 2008, Congress\nimplicitly foreclosed the availability of similar causes of action\nunder the ATS. But the legislative history says otherwise: The\nConference Report that accompanied the original TVPRA took pains to\nemphasize \u201cthat nothing in [the TVPRA] will preclude trafficking\nvictims from availing themselves of applicable State, local or\nother Federal laws in seeking compensatory or other damages and\nrelief in any civil proceeding.\u201d[7] H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 106\u2013939, p.\u00a093 (2000).\nAt bottom, then, there is simply no basis to infer from\n\u201ccongressional activity,\u201dante,at 8, that Congress has by\nimplication grafted a truncated list of actionable torts onto the\nATS that appears nowhere in the statutory text.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The First Congress chose to provide\nnoncitizens a federal forum to seek redress for law-of-nations\nviolations, and it counted on federal courts to facilitate such\nsuits by recognizing causes of action for violations of specific,\nuniversal, and obligatory norms of international law. I would not\nabdicate the Court\u2019s obligation to follow that legislative\ndirective. Because I find no support for Justice Thomas\u2019 position\nin the ATS or in this Court\u2019s precedents, I do not join that\nportion of Justice Thomas\u2019 opinion.Notes1Other \u201cenclaves\u201d in which\nfederal courts develop legal principles in a common-law fashion\ninclude, for example, the areas of admiralty law, disputes between\nStates, and some aspects of federal labor law. SeeCollinsv.Virginia, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 7).2Two \u201cnotorious episodes,\u201d\nin particular, underscored Congress\u2019 impotence.Kiobelv.Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,569 U.S.\n108, 120 (2013). The first occurred in 1784 when a French\nadventurer assaulted the Secretary of the French Legation in\nPhiladelphia, prompting the French Minister to complain to Congress\n\u201cthat a violation of the laws of Nations .\u00a0.\u00a0. hath been\ncommitted.\u201d 27 Journals of the Continental Congress 478 (G. Hunt\ned. 1928). Three years later, a New York City constable created\nanother diplomatic imbroglio by entering the home of the Dutch\nAmbassador and arresting one of his servants. The Ambassador wrote\nto the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, calling the incident \u201ca most\nnotorious and direct violation of the rights of nations\u201d and\ndemanding the Secretary\u2019s \u201cofficial [interposition] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nto obtain the satisfaction due .\u00a0.\u00a0. by virtue of the\nlaws of nations.\u201d Letter from P. Van Berckel to J. Jay (Dec. 18,\n1787), in 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Correspondence of the\nUnited States of America 443 (1837) (hereinafter Diplomatic\nCorrespondence) (brackets in original).3For similar reasons,\nJustice Thomas\u2019 reliance onZiglarv.Abbasi, 582\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), is misplaced. There, this Court explained\nthat, \u201cwhen deciding whether to recognize an implied cause of\naction, the \u2018determinative\u2019 question is one of statutory intent.\u201dId., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quotingAlexanderv.Sandoval,532 U.S.\n275, 286 (2001)). The ATS leaves no room to doubt that Congress\nintended foreign citizens to be able to bring \u201ccivil action[s]\u201d for\n\u201ctort[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. committed in violation of the law of\nnations.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71350.4Notably, Justice Thomas\u2019\nalternative disposition would not answer the question this Court\ngranted certiorari to address,i.e., whether domestic\ncorporations are immune from suit under the ATS (regardless of the\nkind of torts for which they are sued). See Pet. for Cert. in No.\n19\u2013416, at i; Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013453, at i. For reasons\nsimilar to those articulated in my dissent inJesnerv.Arab Bank,PLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018), I\nwould answer this question in the negative. (So would four other\nJustices.) As Justice Gorsuch ably explains, there is no reason to\ninsulate domestic corporations from liability for law-of-nations\nviolations simply because they are legal rather than natural\npersons. Seepost,at 1\u20134 (concurring opinion).5While international law\nsupplies the substantive prohibitions that give rise to actionable\ntorts under the ATS (e.g., the prohibition against child\nslavery), domestic law provides the answer to any subsidiary\nquestions regarding \u201chow a particular actor is held liable for a\ngiven law-of-nations violation.\u201dJesner, 584 U.\u00a0S., at\n___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2). To the extent\nJustice Thomas is worried that federal courts are incapable of\nidentifying such rules of liability in the absence of statutory\ndirection, his concern is belied by the Federal Judiciary\u2019s\nextensive record of doing just that. See,e.g.,Boylev.United Technologies Corp.,487 U.S.\n500, 512\u2013513 (1988) (recognizing a \u201cGovernment contractor\ndefense\u201d to state-law product-liability suits);Consolidated\nRail Corporationv.Gottshall,512\nU.S. 532, 541\u2013557 (1994) (recognizing and defining the scope of\nliability for negligent infliction of emotional distress under the\nFederal Employers\u2019 Liability Act);Agency Holding Corp.v.Malley-Duff & Associates,Inc.,483 U.S.\n143, 156 (1987) (borrowing the Clayton Act\u2019s statute of\nlimitations for purposes of civil actions brought under the\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).6See,e.g.,Khulumaniv.Barclay Nat. Bank Ltd., 504 F.3d 254,\n268\u2013277 (CA2 2007) (Katzmann, J., concurring) (surveying\naiding-and-abetting liability under international\nlaw).7Justice Gorsuch also\npoints out that \u201c[t]he one time Congress deemed a new ATS action\nworth having, it created that actionitselfin the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991 [(TVPA)].\u201dPost,at 5\n(concurring opinion). But Justice Gorsuch fails to mention what the\nCommittee Reports accompanying that statute actually said: that\nwhile the TVPA \u201cestablish[ed] an unambiguous and modern basis for a\ncause of action\u201d to sue perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial\nkilling, the ATS \u201chas other important uses and should not be\nreplaced.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 102\u2013367, pt. 1, p.\u00a03 (1991);\naccord, S.\u00a0Rep. No. 102\u2013249, p.\u00a04 (1991). The Reports\ncautioned that \u201cclaims based on torture or summary executions do\nnot exhaust the list of actions that may appropriately be covered\u201d\nby the ATS, which \u201cshould remain intact to permit suits based on\nother norms that already exist or may ripen in the future into\nrules of customary international law.\u201d H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 102\u2013367,\nat 4; accord, S.\u00a0Rep. No. 102\u2013249, at 5.",
