SKILLING, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[June 24, 2010]Justice Sotomayor, with whom\nJustice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part.I concur in the Court\u2019s\nresolution of the honest-services fraud question and join Part III\nof its opinion. I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s\nconclusion that Jeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an\nimpartial jury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the\npublic\u2019s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a court\nmust be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the jury. In this\ncase, passions ran extremely high. The sudden collapse of Enron\ndirectly affected thousands of people in the Houston area and\nshocked the entire community. The accompanying barrage of local\nmedia coverage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As\nEnron\u2019s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the storm. Even\nif these extraordinary circumstances did not constitutionally\ncompel a change of venue, they required the District Court to\nconduct a thoroughvoir direin which prospective jurors\u2019\nattitudes about the case were closely scrutinized. The District\nCourt\u2019s inquiry lacked the necessary thoroughness and left serious\ndoubts about whether the jury empaneled to decide Skilling\u2019s case\nwas capable of rendering an impartial decision based solely on the\nevidence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would grant\nSkilling relief on his fair-trial claim.IThe majority understates the\nbreadth and depth of community hostility toward Skilling and\noverlooks significant deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s jury\nselection process. The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.\nVirtually overnight, what had been the city\u2019s \u201clargest, most\nvisible, and most prosperous company,\u201d its \u201cforemost social and\ncharitable force,\u201d and \u201ca source of civic pride\u201d was reduced to a\n\u201cshattered shell.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b611, 13, pp. 649a\u2013650a, 1152a. Thousands\nof the company\u2019s employees lost their jobs and saw their retirement\nsavings vanish. As the effects rippled through the local economy,\nthousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses shuttered, and\ncommunity groups that once benefited from Enron\u2019s largesse felt the\nloss of millions of dollars in contributions. See,e.g., 3\nSupp. Record 1229, 1267; see also 554 F.\u00a03d 529, 560 (CA5\n2009) (\u201cAccounting firms that serviced Enron\u2019s books had less work,\nhotels had more open rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so\non\u201d). Enron\u2019s community ties were so extensive that the entire\nlocal U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office was forced to recuse itself from the\nGovernment\u2019s investigation into the company\u2019s fall. See 3 Supp.\nRecord 608 (official press release).With Enron\u2019s demise affecting the\nlives of so many Houstonians, local media coverage of the story\nsaturated the community. According to a defense media expert, the\nHouston Chronicle\u2014the area\u2019s leading newspaper\u2014assigned as many as\n12 reporters to work on the Enron story full time. App. 568a\u2013569a.\nThe paper mentioned Enron in more than 4,000 articles during the\n3-year period following the company\u2019s December 2001 bankruptcy\nfiling. Hundreds of these articles discussed Skilling by name. See\n3 Supp. Record 2114. Skilling\u2019s expert, a professional journalist\nand academic with 30 years\u2019 experience, could not \u201crecall another\ninstance where a local paper dedicated as many resources to a\nsingle topic over such an extended period of time as the Houston\nChronicle \u2026 dedicated to Enron.\u201d App. \u00b632, p. 570a. Local\ntelevision news coverage was similarly pervasive and, in terms of\n\u201ceditorial theme,\u201d \u201clargely followed the Chronicle\u2019s lead.\u201dId., \u00b611, at 559a; see alsoid., at 717a. Between\nMay 2002 and October 2004, local stations aired an estimated 19,000\nnews segments involving Enron, more than 1600 of which mentioned\nSkilling. 3 Supp. Record 2116.While many of the stories were straightforward\nnews items, many others conveyed and amplified the community\u2019s\noutrage at the top executives perceived to be responsible for the\ncompany\u2019s bankruptcy. A Chronicle report on Skilling\u2019s 2002\ntestimony before Congress is typical of the coverage. It began,\n\u201cAcross Houston, Enron employees watched former chief executive\nJeffrey Skilling\u2019s congressional testimony on television, turning\nincredulous, angry and then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew\nas savvy and detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance\nabout critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed energy\ngiant.\u201d App. 1218a. \u201c\u00a0\u2018He is lying; he knew everything,\u2019 said\n[an employee], who said she had seen Skilling frequently over her\n18 years with the firm, where Skilling was known for his intimate\ngrasp of the inner doings at the company. \u2018I am getting sicker by\nthe minute.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 1219a. A companion piece\nquoted a local attorney who called Skilling an \u201cidiot\u201d who was \u201cin\ndenial\u201d; he added, \u201cI\u2019m glad [Skilling\u2019s] not my client.\u201dId., at 592a\u2013593a.Articles deriding Enron\u2019s senior executives\nwere juxtaposed with pieces expressing sympathy toward and\nsolidarity with the company\u2019s many victims. Skilling\u2019s media expert\ncounted nearly a hundred victim-related stories in the Chronicle,\nincluding a \u201cmulti-page layout entitled \u2018The Faces of\nEnron,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which poignantly described the gut-wrenching\nexperiences of former employees who lost vast sums of money, faced\neviction from their homes, could not afford Christmas gifts for\ntheir children, and felt \u201cscared,\u201d \u201churt,\u201d \u201chumiliat[ed],\u201d\n\u201chelpless,\u201d and \u201cbetrayed.\u201dId., \u00b671, at 585a\u2013586a. The\nconventional wisdom that blame for Enron\u2019s devastating implosion\nand the ensuing human tragedy ultimately rested with Skilling and\nformer Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the\npopular imagination that references to their involvement even\nturned up on the sports pages: \u201cIf you believe the story about\n[Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do with the end of\nEmmitt Smith\u2019s Cowboys career, then you probably believe in other\nfar-fetched concepts. Like Jeff Skilling having nothing to do with\nEnron\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp. Record 811.When a federal grand jury indicted Skilling,\nLay, and Richard Causey\u2014Enron\u2019s former chief accounting officer\u2014in\n2004 on charges of conspiracy to defraud, securities fraud, and\nother crimes, the media placed them directly in its crosshairs. In\nthe words of one article, \u201cthere was one thing those whose lives\nwere touched by the once-exalted company all seemed to agree upon:\nThe indictment of former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was overdue.\u201d App.\n1393a. Scoffing at Skilling\u2019s attempts to paint himself as \u201ca\n\u2018victim\u2019 of his subordinates,\u201did., at 1394a, the\nChronicle derided \u201cthe doofus defense\u201d that Lay and Skilling were\nexpected to offer,id., at 1401a.[Footnote 1] The Chronicle referred to the coming\nSkilling/Lay trial as \u201cthe main event\u201d and \u201cThe Big One,\u201d which\nwould finally bring \u201cthe true measure of justice in the Enron\nsaga.\u201d Record 40002; App. 1457a, 1460a.[Footnote 2] On the day the superseding indictment charging\nLay was issued, \u201cthe Chronicle dedicated three-quarters of its\nfront page, 2 other full pages, and substantial portions of 4 other\npages, all in the front or business sections, to th[e] story.\u201dId., \u00b657, at 580a\u2013581a.Citing the widely felt sense of victimhood\namong Houstonians and the voluminous adverse publicity, Skilling\nmoved in November 2004 for a change of venue.[Footnote 3] The District Court denied the motion,\ncharacterizing the media coverage as largely \u201cobjective and\nunemotional.\u201d App. to Brief for United States 11a.Voir\ndire, it concluded, would provide an effective means to\n\u201cferret out any bias\u201d in the jury pool.Id., at 18a; seeante, at 4.To that end, the District Court began the jury\nselection process by mailing screening questionnaires to 400\nprospective jurors in November 2005. The completed questionnaires\nof the 283 respondents not excused for hardship dramatically\nillustrated the widespread impact of Enron\u2019s collapse on the\nHouston community and confirmed the intense animosity of\nHoustonians toward Skilling and his codefendants. More than\none-third of the prospective jurors (approximately 99 of 283, by my\ncount) indicated that they or persons they knew had lost money or\njobs as a result of the Enron bankruptcy. Two-thirds of the jurors\n(about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the defendants\nthat suggested a potential predisposition to convict. In many\ninstances, they did not mince words, describing Skilling as \u201csmug,\u201d\n\u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cbrash,\u201d \u201cconceited,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201cdeceitful,\u201d \u201ctotally\nunethical and criminal,\u201d \u201ca crook,\u201d \u201cthe biggest liar on the face\nof the earth,\u201d and \u201cguilty as sin\u201d (capitalization\nomitted).[Footnote 4] Only\nabout 5 percent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read\nthe Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise \u201cheard or read about any\nof the Enron cases,\u201d Record 13019, were not connected to Enron\nvictims, and gave no answers suggesting possible antipathy toward\nthe defendants.[Footnote 5] The\nparties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of 119 members of the\njury pool for cause, hardship, or disability, but numerous\nindividuals who had made harsh comments about Skilling\nremained.[Footnote 6]On December 28, 2005, shortly after the\nquestionnaires had been returned, Causey pleaded guilty. The plea\nwas covered in lead newspaper and television stories. A front-page\nheadline in the Chronicle proclaimed that \u201cCausey\u2019s plea wreaks\nhavoc for Lay, Skilling.\u201d Record 12049, n. 13; see alsoibid. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who described the\nplea as \u201ca serious blow to the defense\u201d). A Chronicle editorial\nopined that \u201cCausey\u2019s admission of securities fraud \u2026 . makes less\nplausible Lay\u2019s claim that most of the guilty pleas were the result\nof prosecutorial pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.\u201dId., at 12391.With the trial date quickly approaching,\nSkilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the\nquestionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea confirmed that\nhe could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In the alternative,\nSkilling asserted that \u201cdefendants are entitled to a more thorough\njury selection process than currently envisioned by the [c]ourt.\u201dId., at 12067. The court had announced its intention to\nquestion individual jurors at the bench with one attorney for each\nside present, and to complete thevoir direin a single\nday. See,e.g.,id., at 11804\u201311805, 11808.\nSkilling proposed,inter alia, that defense counsel be\nafforded a greater role in questioning,id., at 12074;\nthat jurors be questioned privatelyincameraor\nin a closed courtroom where it would be easier for counsel to\nconsult with their colleagues, clients, and jury consultants,id., at 12070\u201312072; and that the court \u201cavoid leading\nquestions,\u201d which \u201ctend to [e]licit affirmative responses from\nprospective jurors that may not reflect their actual views,\u201did., at 12072. At a minimum, Skilling asserted, the court\nshould grant a continuance of at least 30 days and send a revised\nquestionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors.Id.,\nat 12074\u201312075.The District Court denied Skilling\u2019s motion\nwithout a hearing, stating in a brief order that it was \u201cnot\npersuaded that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants \u2026\nestablish that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise\na presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201dId., at 14115.\nAccording to the court, the \u201cjury questionnaires sent to the\nremaining members of the jury panel and the court\u2019s voir dire\nexamination of the jury panel provide adequate safeguards to\ndefendants and will result in the selection of a fair and impartial\njury in this case.\u201dId., at 14115\u201314116. The court did\nagree to delay the trial by two weeks, until January 30, 2006.The coming trial featured prominently in local\nnews outlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle\ndescribed \u201cthe hurt and anger and resentment\u201d that had been\n\u201cchurn[ing] inside\u201d Houstonians since Enron\u2019s collapse.Id., at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for\noffering a \u201cdoofus defense\u201d (\u201ca plea of not guilty by reason of\nempty-headedness\u201d), the paper stated that \u201cLay and Skilling took\nhundreds of millions in compensation yet now fail to accept the\nresponsibility that went with it.\u201dIbid. The article\nallowed that the defendants\u2019 guilt, \u201cthough perhaps widely assumed,\nremains even now an assertion. A jury now takes up the task of\ndeciding whether that assertion is valid.\u201dId., at 39947.\nThe next paragraph, however, assured readers that \u201cit\u2019s normal for\nyour skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe-eyed\ninnocence that they were unaware that something was amiss at Enron.\nThe company\u2019s utter failure belies the claim.\u201dIbid. (one\nparagraph break omitted); see alsoid., at 39904\n(declaring that Lay and Skilling would \u201chave to offer a convincing\nexplanation for how executives once touted as corporate geniuses\ncould be so much in the dark about the illegal activities and\ndeceptive finances of their own company\u201d).It is against this backdrop of widespread\ncommunity impact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury\nselection in Skilling\u2019s case unfolded. Approximately 160\nprospective jurors appeared forvoir direat a federal\ncourthouse located \u201cabout six blocks from Enron\u2019s former\nheadquarters.\u201d 554 F.\u00a03d, at 561. Addressing them as a group,\nthe District Court began by briefly describing the case and\nproviding a standard admonition about the need to be fair and\nimpartial and to decide the case based solely on the trial evidence\nand jury instructions. The court then asked whether anyone had \u201cany\nreservations about your ability to conscientiously and fairly\nfollow these very important rules.\u201d App. 815a. Two individuals\nraised their hands and were called forward to the bench. One told\nthe court that he thought Lay and Skilling \u201cknew exactly what they\nwere doing\u201d and would have to prove their innocence.Id.,\nat 818a\u2013819a. The second juror, who had stated on his written\nquestionnaire that he held no opinion that would preclude him from\nbeing impartial, declared that he \u201cwould dearly love to sit on this\njury. I would love to claim responsibility, at least 1/12 of the\nresponsibility, for putting these sons of bitches away for the rest\nof their lives.\u201dId., at 819a\u2013820a. The court excused both\njurors for cause.The court proceeded to question individual\njurors from the bench. As the majority recounts,ante, at\n7\u20138, the court asked them a few general yes/no questions about\ntheir exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of, \u201cDo you\nrecall any particular articles that stand out that you\u2019ve read\nabout the case?\u201d App. 850a. The court also asked about\nquestionnaire answers that suggested bias, focusing mainly on\nwhether, notwithstanding seemingly partial comments, the\nprospective jurors believed they \u201ccould be fair\u201d and \u201cput the\ngovernment to its proof.\u201dId., at 852a. Counsel were\npermitted to follow up on issues raised by the court. The court\nmade clear, however, that its patience would be limited, see,e.g.,id., at 879a, and questioning tended to be\nbrief\u2014generally less than five minutes per person. Even so, it\nexposed disqualifying biases among several prospective jurors who\nhad earlier expressed no concerns about their ability to be\nfair.[Footnote 7]Once it identified 38 qualified prospective\njurors, the court allowed the defense and Government to exercise\ntheir allotted peremptory challenges. This left 12 jurors and 4\nalternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for the first time,\n\u201cnot [to] read anything dealing with the case or listen to any\ndiscussion of the case on radio or television or access any\nInternet sites that may deal with the case\u201d and to \u201cinform your\nfriends and family members that they should not discuss with you\nanything they may have read or heard about this case.\u201dId., at 1026a. Start to finish, the selection process took\nabout five hours.Skilling\u2019s trial commenced the next day and\nlasted four months. After several days of deliberations, the jury\nfound Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities fraud,\n5 counts of making false representations to auditors, and 1 count\nof insider trading; it acquitted on 9 insider trading counts. The\njury found Lay guilty on all counts.On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been\ndenied his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial\njury. Addressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by\ndisavowing the District Court\u2019s findings concerning \u201ccommunity\nhostility.\u201d There was, the court concluded, \u201csufficient\ninflammatory pretrial material to require a finding of presumed\nprejudice, especially in light of the immense volume of coverage.\u201d\n554 F.\u00a03d, at 559. \u201c[P]rejudice was [also] inherent in an\nalleged co-conspirator\u2019s well-publicized decision to plead guilty\non the eve of trial.\u201dIbid. The Court of Appeals,\nmoreover, faulted the District Court for failing to \u201cconsider the\nwider context.\u201dId., at 560. \u201c[I]t was not enough for the\ncourt merely to assess the tone of the news reporting. The\nevaluation of the volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy\nfor the real inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrelevant\nsources.\u201dIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]he district court seemed to\noverlook that the prejudice came from more than just pretrial media\npublicity, but also from the sheer number of victims.\u201dIbid.Having determined that \u201cSkilling was entitled\nto a presumption of prejudice,\u201d the Court of Appeals proceeded to\nexplain that \u201cthe presumption is rebuttable, \u2026 and the government\nmay demonstrate from thevoir direthat an impartial jury\nwas actually impanelled.\u201dId., at 561 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Describing thevoir direas \u201cexemplary,\u201d\n\u201csearching,\u201d and \u201cproper and thorough,\u201did., at 562, the\ncourt concluded that \u201c[t]he government [had] met its burden of\nshowing that the actual jury that convicted Skilling was\nimpartial,\u201did., at 564\u2013565. On this basis, the Court of\nAppeals rejected Skilling\u2019s claim and affirmed his convictions.IIThe Sixth Amendment right to an\nimpartial jury and the due process right to a fundamentally fair\ntrial guarantee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set\naside preconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and\ndecide guilt or innocence \u201cbased on the evidence presented in\ncourt.\u201dIrvinv.Dowd,366 U. S. 717, 723 (1961); see alsoSheppardv.Maxwell,384 U. S. 333, 362 (1966). Community\npassions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial publicity, can call\nthe integrity of a trial into doubt. In some instances, this Court\nhas observed, the hostility of the community becomes so severe as\nto give rise to a \u201cpresumption of [juror] prejudice.\u201dPattonv.Yount,467\nU. S. 1025, 1031 (1984).The Court of Appeals incorporated\nthe concept of presumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting\nframework: Once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of\ncommunity hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to prove the\nimpartiality of the jury. The majority similarly envisions a fixed\npoint at which public passions become so intense that prejudice to\na defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights must be presumed. The majority\ndeclines, however, to decide whether the presumption is rebuttable,\nas the Court of Appeals held.This Court has never treated the notion of\npresumptive prejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead\nmerely convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of\npublic enmity rises, so too does the danger that the prejudices of\nthe community will infiltrate the jury. The underlying question has\nalways been this: Do we have confidence that the jury\u2019s verdict was\n\u201cinduced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by\nany outside influence, whether of private talk or public print\u201d?Pattersonv.Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of\nColo.,205 U.\nS. 454, 462 (1907).The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In\nselecting a jury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the\nintensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial publicity\nand community animus. Reviewing courts, meanwhile, must assess\nwhether the trial court\u2019s procedures sufficed under the\ncircumstances to keep the jury free from disqualifying bias. Cf.Murphyv.Florida,421\nU. S. 794, 799 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for \u201cany\nindications in the totality of circumstances that petitioner\u2019s\ntrial was not fundamentally fair\u201d). This Court\u2019s precedents\nillustrate the sort of steps required in different situations to\nsafeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before\nan impartial jury.At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on\nrare occasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circumstances\nthat it has reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cwithout pausing to\nexamine \u2026 thevoir direexamination of the members of the\njury.\u201dRideauv.Louisiana,373 U. S. 723, 727 (1963). InRideau, repeated television broadcasts of the defendant\u2019s\nconfession to murder, robbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned\nlocal sentiment as to raise doubts that even the most carefulvoir direcould have secured an impartial jury. A change\nof venue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to assure a\nfair trial.Ibid.;see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N.\nKing, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a723.2(a), p. 264 (3d ed.\n2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (\u201cThe best reading ofRideauis\nthat the Court there recognized that prejudicial publicity may be\nso inflammatory and so pervasive that the voir dire simply cannot\nbe trusted to fully reveal the likely prejudice among prospective\njurors\u201d).As the majority describes,ante, at\n14, this Court reached similar conclusions inEstesv.Texas,381\nU. S. 532(1965), andSheppard,384 U. S. 333. These cases involved\nnot only massive pretrial publicity but also media disruption of\nthe trial process itself. Rejecting the argument that the\ndefendants were not entitled to relief from their convictions\nbecause they \u201cha[d] established no isolatable prejudice,\u201d the Court\ndescribed the \u201cuntoward circumstances\u201d as \u201cinherently suspect.\u201dEstes, 381 U. S., at 542, 544. It would have been\ndifficult for the jurors not to have been swayed, at least\nsubconsciously, by the \u201cbedlam\u201d that surrounded them.Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 355. Criticizing the trial courts\u2019\nfailures \u201cto protect the jury from outside influence,\u201did., at 358, the Court stressed that, \u201cwhere there is a\nreasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will\nprevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the\nthreat abates, or transfer it to another [venue] not so permeated\nwith publicity.\u201dId., at 363.EstesandSheppardthus appliedRideau\u2019s insight that in\nparticularly extreme circumstances even the most rigorousvoir\ndirecannot suffice to dispel the reasonable likelihood of\njury bias.Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court\nhas declined to discountvoir direentirely and has\ninstead examined the particulars of the jury selection process to\ndetermine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted by\npretrial publicity and community animus. The Court has recognized\nthat when antipathy toward a defendant pervades the community there\nis a high risk that biased jurors will find their way onto the\npanel. The danger is not merely that some prospective jurors will\ndeliberately hide their prejudices, but also that, as \u201cpart of a\ncommunity deeply hostile to the accused,\u201d \u201cthey may unwittingly\n[be] influenced\u201d by the fervor that surrounds them.Murphy, 421 U. S., at 803. To assure an impartial jury in\nsuch adverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully consider\nthe knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors and then closely\nscrutinize the reliability of their assurances of fairness. Cf.Morganv.Illinois,504 U. S. 719, 729\n(1992) (\u201c[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an\nimpartial jury is an adequatevoir direto identify\nunqualified jurors\u201d).Irvinoffers an example of a case in\nwhich the trial court\u2019svoir diredid not suffice to\ncounter the \u201cwave of public passion\u201d that had swept the community\nprior to the defendant\u2019s trial. 366 U. S., at 728. The local news\nmedia had \u201cextensively covered\u201d the crimes (a murder spree),\n\u201carous[ing] great excitement and indignation.\u201dId., at 719\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin\u2019s arrest, the\npress \u201cblanketed\u201d the community with \u201ca barrage of newspaper\nheadlines, articles, cartoons and pictures\u201d communicating numerous\nunfavorable details about Irvin, including that he had purportedly\nconfessed.Id., at 725. Nearly 90 percent of the 430\nprospective jurors examined during the trial court\u2019svoir\ndire\u201centertained some opinion as to guilt\u2014ranging in\nintensity from mere suspicion to absolute certainty.\u201dId.,\nat 727. Of the 12 jurors seated, 8 \u201cthought petitioner was guilty,\u201d\nalthough \u201ceach indicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could\nrender an impartial verdict.\u201dId., at 727, 724.Despite the seated jurors\u2019 assurances of\nimpartiality, this Court invalidated Irvin\u2019s conviction for want of\ndue process. \u201cIt is not required,\u201d this Court declared, \u201cthat the\njurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. \u2026 It\nis sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion\nand render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201dId., at 722\u2013723. The Court emphasized, however, that a\njuror\u2019s word on this matter is not decisive, particularly when \u201cthe\nbuild-up of prejudice [in the community] is clear and convincing.\u201dId., at 725. Many of Irvin\u2019s jurors, the Court noted, had\nbeen influenced by \u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown\nto be present throughout the community.\u201dId., at 727\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not \u201cdoubt [that]\neach juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and\nimpartial to [Irvin], but \u2026 [w]here so many, so many times,\nadmitted prejudice, such a statement of impartiality can be given\nlittle weight.\u201dId., at 728.The media coverage and community animosity inIrvinwas particularly intense. In three subsequent cases,\nthis Court recognized that high-profile cases may generate\nsubstantial publicity without stirring similar public passions. The\njury selection process in such cases, the Court clarified,\ngenerally need not be as exhaustive as in a case such asIrvin. So long as the trial court conducts a reasonable\ninquiry into extrajudicial influences and the ability of\nprospective jurors to presume innocence and render a verdict based\nsolely on the trial evidence, we would generally have no reason to\ndoubt the jury\u2019s impartiality.[Footnote 8]The first of these cases,Murphy,421\nU. S. 794, involved a well-known defendant put on trial for a\nwidely publicized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied\nhis motion for a change of venue and duringvoir direexcused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. DistinguishingIrvin, this Court saw no indication in thevoir\ndireof \u201csuch hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who served\nin his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid\naside.\u201d 421 U. S., at 800. Although some jurors \u201chad a vague\nrecollection of the robbery with which [Murphy] was charged and\neach had some knowledge of [his] past crimes,\u201d \u201cnone betrayed any\nbelief in the relevance of [Murphy\u2019s] past to the present case.\u201dIbid.;see alsoibid., n.\u00a04 (contrasting a\njuror\u2019s \u201cmere familiarity with [a defendant] or his past\u201d with \u201can\nactual predisposition against him\u201d). \u201c[T]hese indicia of\nimpartiality,\u201d the Court suggested, \u201cmight be disregarded in a case\nwhere the general atmosphere in the community or courtroom is\nsufficiently inflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding\n[Murphy\u2019s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.\u201dId.,\nat 802.In a second case,Yount,467\nU. S. 1025, the defendant was granted a new trial four years\nafter being convicted of murder. He requested a change of venue,\nciting pretrial publicity and the widespread local knowledge that\nhe had previously been convicted and had made confessions that\nwould be inadmissible in court. The state trial court denied\nYount\u2019s motion and seated a jury following a 10-dayvoir\ndireof 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the prospective\njurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent \u201cadmitted they would\ncarry an opinion into the jury box.\u201dId., at 1029.\nDeclining to grant relief on federal habeas review, this Court\nstressed the significant interval between Yount\u2019s first trial\u2014when\n\u201cadverse publicity and the community\u2019s sense of outrage were at\ntheir height\u201d\u2014and his second trial, which \u201cdid not occur until four\nyears later, at a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly\ndiminished and community sentiment had softened.\u201dId., at\n1032. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had \u201cat some\ntime \u2026 formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt,\u201d the \u201cparticularly\nextensive\u201dvoir direconfirmed that \u201ctime had weakened or\neliminated any\u201d bias they once may have harbored.Id., at\n1029\u20131030, 1034, n.\u00a010, 1033. Accordingly, this Court\nconcluded, \u201cthe trial court did not commit manifest error in\nfinding that the jury as a whole was impartial.\u201dId., at\n1032.This Court most recently wrestled with the\nissue of pretrial publicity inMu\u2019Minv.Virginia,500 U. S. 415(1991). Mu\u2019Min stood\naccused of murdering a woman while out of prison on a work detail.\nCiting 47 newspaper articles about the crime, Mu\u2019Min moved for a\nchange of venue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and\nattempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of the 26\nprospective jurors indicated that they had heard about the case\nfrom media or other sources. Dividing these prospective jurors into\npanels of four, the court asked further general questions about\ntheir ability to be fair given what they had heard or read. One\njuror answered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The court\nrefused Mu\u2019Min\u2019s request to ask more specific questions \u201crelating\nto the content of news items that potential jurors might have read\nor seen.\u201dId., at 419. Of the 12 persons who served on the\njury, \u201c8 had at one time or another read or heard something about\nthe case. None had indicated that he had formed an opinion about\nthe case or would be biased in any way.\u201dId., at 421.Rejecting Mu\u2019Min\u2019s attempt to analogize his\ncase toIrvin, this Court observed that \u201cthe cases differ\nboth in the kind of community in which the coverage took place and\nin extent of media coverage.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429. Mu\u2019Min\u2019s offense\noccurred in the metropolitan Washington, D.\u00a0C., area, \u201cwhich\nhas a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately,\nhundreds of murders are committed each year.\u201dIbid. While\nthe crime garnered \u201csubstantial\u201d pretrial publicity, the coverage\nwas not as pervasive as inIrvinand \u201cdid not contain the\nsame sort of damaging information.\u201d 500 U. S., at 429\u2013430.\nMoreover, in contrast toIrvin, the seated jurors\nuniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case.\nGiven these circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu\u2019Min\u2019s assertion\nthat the trial court committed constitutional error by declining to\n\u201cmake precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that\npotential jurors have read.\u201d 500 U. S., at 424. The Court stressed,\nhowever, that its ruling was context-specific: \u201cHad the trial court\nin this case been confronted with the \u2018wave of public passion\u2019\nengendered by pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with\nIrvin\u2019s trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nmight well have required more extensive examination of potential\njurors than it undertook here.\u201dId., at 429.IIIIt is necessary to determine how\nthis case compares to our existing fair-trial precedents. Were the\ncircumstances so inherently prejudicial that, as inRideau, even the most scrupulousvoir direwould\nhave been \u201cbut a hollow formality\u201d incapable of reliably producing\nan impartial jury? 373 U. S., at 726. If the circumstances were not\nof this character, did the District Court conduct a jury selection\nprocess sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and\ncommunity animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable of\npresuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial influences?AThough the question is close, I\nagree with the Court that the prospect of seating an unbiased jury\nin Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the\nDistrict Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\u2019s\nmotion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this\nconclusion. First, as the Court observes,ante, at 16, the\nsize and diversity of the Houston community make it probable that\nthe jury pool contained a nontrivial number of persons who were\nunaffected by Enron\u2019s collapse, neutral in their outlook, and\nunlikely to be swept up in the public furor. Second, media coverage\nof the case, while ubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as\nthe Court points out,ante, at 17, contain a confession by\nSkilling or similar \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence of specific criminal\nacts. For many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefendant\nand alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the pleas and\nconvictions of other Enron executives, no doubt suggested guilt by\nassociation. But reasonable minds exposed to such information would\nnot necessarily have formed an indelible impression that Skilling\nhimself was guilty as charged. Cf.Rideau, 373 U. S., at\n726 (a majority of the county\u2019s residents were \u201cexposed repeatedly\nand in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in\ndetail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged\u201d).\nThird, there is no suggestion that the courtroom in this case\nbecame, as inEstesandSheppard, a \u201ccarnival\u201d in\nwhich the \u201ccalmness and solemnity\u201d of the proceedings was\ncompromised.Sheppard, 384 U. S., at 358, 350 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It is thus appropriate to examine thevoir direand determine whether it instills confidence in\nthe impartiality of the jury actually selected.[Footnote 9]BIn concluding that thevoir\ndire\u201cadequately detect[ed] and defuse[d] juror bias,\u201dante, at 20, the Court downplays the extent of the\ncommunity\u2019s antipathy toward Skilling and exaggerates the rigor of\nthe jury selection process. The devastating impact of Enron\u2019s\ncollapse and the relentless media coverage demanded exceptional\ncare on the part of the District Court to ensure the seating of an\nimpartial jury. While the procedures employed by the District Court\nmight have been adequate in the typical high-profile case, they did\nnot suffice in the extraordinary circumstances of this case to\nsafeguard Skilling\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before an\nimpartial jury.In conducting this analysis, I am\nmindful of the \u201cwide discretion\u201d owed to trial courts when it comes\nto jury-related issues.Mu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 427; cf.ante, at 20\u201321. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to\nassess public sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors.\nProximity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons in\nthe midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view. \u201c[A]ppellate\ntribunals [thus] have the duty to make an independent evaluation of\nthe circumstances.\u201dSheppard, 384 U. S., at 362. In\nparticular, reviewing courts are well qualified to inquire into\nwhether a trial court implemented procedures adequate to keep\ncommunity prejudices from infecting the jury. If the jury selection\nprocess does not befit the circumstances of the case, the trial\ncourt\u2019s rulings on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt.\nSeeMorgan, 504 U. S., at 729\u2013730 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Without an\nadequatevoir direthe trial judge\u2019s responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to\nfollow the court\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be\nfulfilled\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingRosales-Lopezv.United\nStates,451 U.\nS. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see alsoMu\u2019Min, 500 U. S., at 451 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cOur\nwillingness to accord substantial deference to a trial court\u2019s\nfinding of juror impartiality rests on our expectation that the\ntrial court will conduct a sufficientvoir direto\ndetermine the credibility of a juror professing to be\nimpartial\u201d).1As the Court of Appeals\napprehended, the District Court gave short shrift to the\nmountainous evidence of public hostility. For Houstonians, Enron\u2019s\ncollapse was an event of once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only\nwas the volume of media coverage \u201cimmense\u201d and frequently\nintemperate, but \u201cthe sheer number of victims\u201d created a climate in\nwhich animosity toward Skilling ran deep and the desire for\nconviction was widely shared. 554 F.\u00a03d, at 559\u2013560.The level of public animus toward\nSkilling dwarfed that present in cases such asMurphyandMu\u2019Min. The pretrial publicity in those cases consisted of\ndozens of news reports, most of which were \u201clargely factual in\nnature.\u201dMurphy, 421 U. S., at 802. There was no\nindication that the relevant communities had been captivated by the\ncases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In contrast,\nthe number of media reports in this case reached the tens of\nthousands, and full-throated denunciations of Skilling were common.\nThe much closer analogy is thus toIrvin, which similarly\nfeatured a \u201cbarrage\u201d of media coverage and a \u201chuge \u2026 wave of public\npassion,\u201d 366 U. S., at 725, 728, although even that case did not,\nas here, involve direct harm to entire segments of the\ncommunity.[Footnote 10]Attempting to distinguishIrvin, the\nmajority suggests that Skilling\u2019s economic offenses were less\nincendiary than Irvin\u2019s violent crime spree and that \u201cnews stories\nabout Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information\nrife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies and murders.\u201dAnte, at 28. Along similar lines, the District Court\ndescribed \u201cthe facts of this case [as] neither heinous nor\nsensational.\u201d App. to Brief for United States 10a. The majority\nalso points to the four years that passed between Enron\u2019s\ndeclaration of bankruptcy and the start of Skilling\u2019s trial,\nasserting that \u201cthe decibel level of media attention diminished\nsomewhat\u201d over this time.Ante, at 17. Neither of these\narguments is persuasive.First, while violent crimes may well provoke\nwidespread community outrage more readily than crimes involving\nmonetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of rousing\npublic passions, particularly when thousands of unsuspecting people\nare robbed of their livelihoods and retirement savings. Indeed, the\nrecord in this case is replete with examples of visceral outrage\ntoward Skilling and other Enron executives. See,e.g.,\nRecord 39946 (front-page, eve-of-trial story describing \u201cthe hurt\nand anger and resentment \u2026 churn[ing] inside\u201d the people of\nHouston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other things, a\nrapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terrorist.[Footnote 11] As one commentator observed,\n\u201c[i]t\u2019s a sign of how shocked Houstonians are about Enron\u2019s\nignominious demise that Sept. 11 can be invoked\u2014and is\nfrequently\u2014to explain the shock of the company\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp.\nRecord 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and other top\nexecutives hired private security to protect themselves from\npersons inclined to take the law into their own hands. See,e.g., App. 1154a (\u201cAfter taking the temperature of Enron\u2019s\nvictims, [a local lawyer] says the Enron executives are wise to\ntake security precautions\u201d).Second, the passage of time did little to\nsoften community sentiment. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion,ante, at 17, this case in no way resemblesYount,\nwhere, by the time of the defendant\u2019s retrial, \u201cprejudicial\npublicity [had] greatly diminished\u201d and community animus had\nsignificantly waned. 467 U. S., at 1032; see alsoibid.\n(in the months preceding the defendant\u2019s retrial, newspaper reports\nabout the case averaged \u201cless than one article per month,\u201d and\npublic interest was \u201cminimal\u201d). The Enron story was a continuing\nsaga, and \u201cpublicity remained intense throughout.\u201d 554 F.\u00a03d,\nat 560. Not only did Enron\u2019s downfall generate wall-to-wall news\ncoverage, but so too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related\nevents.[Footnote 12] Of\nparticular note is the highly publicized guilty plea of codefendant\nCausey just weeks before Skilling\u2019s trial. If anything, the time\nthat elapsed between the bankruptcy and the trial made the task of\nseating an unbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members\nof the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related guilty plea\nor conviction likely served to increase their certainty that\nSkilling too had engaged in\u2014if not masterminded\u2014criminal acts,\nparticularly given that the media coverage reinforced this view.\nSeesupra, at 7\u20138. The trial of Skilling and Lay was the\nculmination of all that had come before. See Record 40002 (noting\nthat \u201cprosecutors followed the classic pattern of working their way\nup through the ranks\u201d). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005,\nshortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services\nexecutives ended without convictions, \u201cThe real trial, the true\nmeasure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in January. Let the\nsmall fry swim free if need be. We\u2019ve got bigger fish in need of\nfrying.\u201d App. 1460a (paragraph breaks omitted); see alsoibid. (\u201cFrom the beginning, the Enron prosecution has had\none true measure of success: Lay and Skilling in a cold steel\ncage\u201d).Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the\nHouston community remained overwhelmingly negative was dispelled by\nprospective jurors\u2019 responses to the written questionnaires. As\npreviously indicated,supra, at 5\u20137, more than one-third\nof the prospective jurors either knew victims of Enron\u2019s collapse\nor were victims themselves, and two-thirds gave responses\nsuggesting an antidefendant bias. In many instances their contempt\nfor Skilling was palpable. See nn.\u00a04, 6,supra. Only\na small fraction of the prospective jurors raised no red flags in\ntheir responses. And this wasbeforeCausey\u2019s guilty plea\nand the flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of\ntrial. One of Skilling\u2019s experts, a political scientist who had\nstudied pretrial publicity \u201cfor over 35 years\u201d and consulted in\nmore than 200 high-profile cases (in which he had recommended\nagainst venue changes more often than not), \u201cc[a]me to the\nconclusion that the extent and depth of bias shown in these\nquestionnaires is the highest or at least one of the very highest I\nhave ever encountered.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b62, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis\ndeleted).2Given the extent of the antipathy\nevident both in the community at large and in the responses to the\nwritten questionnaire, it was critical for the District Court to\ntake \u201cstrong measures\u201d to ensure the selection of \u201can impartial\njury free from outside influences.\u201dSheppard, 384 U. S.,\nat 362. As this Court has recognized, \u201c[i]n a community where most\nveniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability\nof the others\u2019 protestations may be drawn into question.\u201dMurphy, 421 U. S., at 803; see alsoGroppiv.Wisconsin,400 U. S. 505, 510\n(1971) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[A]ny judge who has sat with juries knows that in\nspite of forms they are extremely likely to be impregnated by the\nenvironing atmosphere\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingFrankv.Mangum,237\nU. S. 309, 349 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps\nbecause it had underestimated the public\u2019s antipathy toward\nSkilling, the District Court\u2019s 5-hourvoir direwas\nmanifestly insufficient to identify and remove biased\njurors.[Footnote 13]As an initial matter, important\nlines of inquiry were not pursued at all. The majority accepts, for\ninstance, that \u201cpublicity about a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea calls\nfor inquiry to guard against actual prejudice.\u201dAnte, at\n19. Implying that the District Court undertook this inquiry, the\nmajority states that \u201c[o]nly two venire members recalled [Causey\u2019s]\nplea.\u201dIbid. In fact, the court asked very few prospective\njurors any questions directed to their knowledge of or feelings\nabout that event.[Footnote\n14] Considering how much news the plea generated, many more\nthan two venire members were likely aware of it. The lack of\nquestioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea on\nthose jurors impossible to assess.The court also rarely asked prospective jurors\nto describe personal interactions they may have had about the case,\nor to consider whether they might have difficulty avoiding\ndiscussion of the case with family, friends, or colleagues during\nthe course of the lengthy trial. The tidbits of information that\ntrickled out on these subjects provided cause for concern. In\nresponse to general media-related questions, several prospective\njurors volunteered that they had spoken with others about the case.\nJuror 74, for example, indicated that her husband was the \u201cnews\nperson,\u201d that they had \u201ctalked about it,\u201d that she had also heard\nthings \u201cfrom work,\u201d and that what she heard was \u201call negative, of\ncourse.\u201d App. 948a. The court, however, did not seek elaboration\nabout the substance of these interactions. Surely many prospective\njurors had similar conversations, particularly once they learned\nupon receiving the written questionnaire that they might end up on\nSkilling\u2019s jury.Prospective jurors\u2019 personal interactions,\nmoreover, may well have left them with the sense that the community\nwas counting on a conviction. Yet this too was a subject the\nDistrict Court did not adequately explore. On the few occasions\nwhen prospective jurors were asked whether they would feel pressure\nfrom the public to convict, they acknowledged that it might be\ndifficult to return home after delivering a not-guilty verdict.\nJuror 75, for instance, told the court, \u201cI think a lot of people\nfeel that they\u2019re guilty. And maybe they\u2019re expecting something to\ncome out of this trial.\u201dId., at 956a. It would be\n\u201ctough,\u201d she recognized, \u201cto vote not guilty and go back into the\ncommunity.\u201dId., at 957a; see alsoid., at 852a\n(Juror 10) (admitting \u201csome hesitancy\u201d about \u201ctelling people the\ngovernment didn\u2019t prove its case\u201d).With respect to potential nonmedia sources of\nbias, the District Court\u2019s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly\ntroubling.[Footnote 15]\nAlthough Juror 101 responded in the negative when asked whether she\nhad \u201cread anything in the newspaper that [stood] out in [her]\nmind,\u201d she volunteered that she \u201cjust heard that, between the two\nof them, [Skilling and Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their\ncase and that there was an insurance policy that they could collect\non, also.\u201dId., at 998a. This information, she explained,\n\u201cwas just something I overheard today\u2014other jurors talking.\u201dIbid. It seemed suspicious, she intimated, \u201cto have an\ninsurance policy ahead of time.\u201dId., at 999a. The court\nadvised her that \u201cmost corporations provide insurance for their\nofficers and directors.\u201dIbid. The court, however, did not\ninvestigate the matter further, even though it had earlier\ninstructed prospective jurors not to talk to each other about the\ncase.Id., at 843a. It is thus not apparent whether other\nprospective jurors also overheard the information and whether they\ntoo believed that it reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor\nis it apparent what other outside information may have been shared\namong the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101\u2019s statements\nindicate that the court\u2019s questions were failing to bring to light\nthe extent of jurors\u2019 exposure to potentially prejudicial facts and\nthat some prospec- tive jurors were having difficulty following the\ncourt\u2019s directives.The topics that the District Court did cover\nwere addressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were\nasked just a few yes/no questions about their general exposure to\nmedia coverage and a handful of additional questions concerning any\nresponses to the written questionnaire that suggested bias. In many\ninstances, their answers were unenlightening.[Footnote 16] Yet the court rarely sought to\ndraw them out with open-ended questions about their impressions of\nEnron or Skilling and showed limited patience for counsel\u2019s\nfollowup efforts. See,e.g.,id., at 879a,\n966a.[Footnote 17] When\nprospective jurors were more forthcoming, their responses tended to\nhighlight the ubiquity and negative tone of the local news\ncoverage, thus underscoring the need to press the more guarded\nmembers of the venire for further information.[Footnote 18] Juror 17, for example, mentioned\nhearing a radio program that very morning in which a former Enron\nemployee compared persons who did not think Skilling was guilty to\nHolocaust deniers. Seeid., at 863a (\u201c[H]e said he thought\nthat he would find them guilty automatically if he was on the jury\nbecause he said that it would be worse than a German trying to say\nthat they didn\u2019t kill the Jews\u201d).[Footnote 19] Other jurors may well have encountered, and\nbeen influenced by, similarly incendiary rhetoric.These deficiencies in the form and content of\nthevoir direquestions contributed to a deeper problem:\nThe District Court failed to make a sufficiently critical\nassessment of prospective jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality.\nAlthough the Court insists otherwise,ante, at 26, thevoir diretranscript indicates that the District Court\nessentially took jurors at their word when they promised to be\nfair. Indeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any\nprospective juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of\nimpartiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it. Juror\n29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that Skilling was \u201cnot\nan honest man.\u201d App. 881a. During questioning, she acknowledged\nhaving previously thought the defendants were guilty, and she\ndisclosed that she lost $50,000\u2013$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result\nof Enron\u2019s collapse.Id., at 880a, 883a. But she\nultimately agreed that she would be able to presume innocence.Id., at 881a, 884a. Noting that she \u201cblame[d] Enron for\nthe loss of her money\u201d and appeared to have \u201cunshakeable bias,\u201d\nSkilling\u2019s counsel challenged her for cause.Id., at 885a.\nThe court, however, declined to remove her, stating that \u201cshe\nanswered candidly she\u2019s going to have an open mind now\u201d and\n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with the Government\u2019s assertion that \u201cwe have to take\nher at her word.\u201dId., at 885a\u2013886a.[Footnote 20] As this Court has made plain,\njurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality simply are not entitled to this\nsort of talismanic significance. See,e.g.,Murphy, 421 U. S., at 800 (\u201c[T]he juror\u2019s assurances that\nhe is equal to th[e] task cannot be dispositive of the accused\u2019s\nrights\u201d);Irvin, 366 U. S., at 728 (\u201cWhere so many, so\nmany times, admi[t] prejudice, \u2026 a statement of impartiality can be\ngiven little weight\u201d).Worse still, the District Court on a number of\noccasions accepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal\non their face. Prospective jurors who \u201chope[d]\u201d they could presume\ninnocence and did \u201cnot necessarily\u201d think Skilling was guilty were\npermitted to remain in the pool. App. 932a, 857a. Juror 61, for\ninstance, wrote of Lay on her questionnaire, \u201cShame on him.\u201dId., at 931a. Asked by the court about this, she stated\nthat, \u201cinnocent or guilty, he was at the helm\u201d and \u201cshould have\nknown what was going on at the company.\u201dIbid.;see alsoid., at 934a (Skilling is \u201cprobably\u201d \u201cin the same boat as\u201d\nLay). The court then asked, \u201ccan you presume, as you start this\ntrial, that Mr. Lay is innocent?\u201dId., at 932a. She\nresponded, \u201cI hope so, but you know. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t honestly\nanswer that one way or the other.\u201dIbid.;see alsoid., at 933a (\u201cI bring in my past history. I bring in my\nbiases. I would like to think I could rise above those, but I\u2019ve\nnever been in this situation before. So I don\u2019t know how I could\nhonestly answer that question one way or the other. \u2026 I do have\nsome concerns\u201d). Eventually, however, Juror 61 answered \u201cYes\u201d when\nthe court asked if she would be able to acquit if she had \u201ca\nreasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty.\u201dId., at\n933a\u2013934a. Challenging her for cause, defense counsel insisted that\nthey had not received \u201ca clear and unequivocal answer\u201d about her\nability to be fair.Ibid. The court denied the challenge,\nstating, \u201cYou know, she tried.\u201dIbid.3The majority takes solace in the\nfact that most of the persons actually seated as jurors and\nalternates \u201cspecifically stated that they had paid scant attention\nto Enron-related news.\u201dAnte, at 24\u201325, and n.\n26.[Footnote 21] In context,\nhowever, these general declarations reveal little about the seated\njurors\u2019 actual knowledge or views or the possible pressure they\nmight have felt to convict, and thus cannot instill confidence that\nthe jurors \u201cwere not under [the] sway\u201d of the prevailing community\nsentiment. Cf.ante, at 25. Jurors who did not \u201cget into\ndetails\u201d of Enron\u2019s complicated accounting schemes, App. 856a,\nnevertheless knew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including\nthat Skilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains. Juror\n63, for instance, told the court that she \u201cmay have heard a little\nbit\u201d about Enron-related litigation but had not \u201creally pa[id]\nattention.\u201dId., at 935a. Yet she was clearly aware of\nsome specifics. On her questionnaire, despite stating that she had\nnot followed Enron-related news, she wrote about \u201cwhistleblowers\nand Arthur Andersen lying about Enron\u2019s accounting,\u201d and she\nexpressed the view that Skilling and Lay \u201cprobably knew they were\nbreaking the law.\u201d Supp. App. 105sa\u2013106sa. During questioning,\nwhich lasted barely four minutes, the District Court obtained no\nmeaningful information about the actual extent of Juror 63\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the case or the basis for her belief in Skilling\u2019s\nguilt. Yet it nevertheless accepted her assurance that she could\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d presume innocence. App. 937a.[Footnote 22]Indeed, the District Court\u2019s\nanemic questioning did little to dispel similar doubts about the\nimpartiality of numerous other seated jurors and alternates. In my\nestimation, more than half of those seated made written and oral\ncomments suggesting active antipathy toward the defendants. The\nmajority thus misses the mark when it asserts that \u201cSkilling\u2019s\nseated jurors \u2026 exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown inIrvin.\u201dAnte, at 29. Juror 10, for instance,\nreported on his written questionnaire that he knew several\nco-workers who owned Enron stock; that he personally may have owned\nEnron stock through a mutual fund; that he heard and read about the\nEnron cases from the \u201cHouston Chronicle, all three Houston news\nchannels, Fox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and]\nTexas Lawyer Magazine\u201d; that he believed Enron\u2019s collapse \u201cwas due\nto greed and mismanagement\u201d; that \u201c[i]f [Lay] did not know what was\ngoing on in his company, he was really a poor manager/leader\u201d; and\nthat the defendants were \u201csuspect.\u201d Supp. App. 11sa\u201319sa. During\nquestioning, he said he \u201cth[ought]\u201d he could presume innocence and\n\u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he could put the Government to its proof, but he also\nacknowledged that he might have \u201csome hesitancy\u201d \u201cin telling people\nthe government didn\u2019t prove its case.\u201d App. 851a\u2013852a.Juror 11 wrote that he \u201cwork[ed] with someone\nwho worked at Enron\u201d; that he got Enron-related news from the\n\u201cHouston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13 News, O\u2019Reilly\nFactor, [and] talking with friends and co-workers\u201d; that he\nregularly visited the Chronicle Web site; that \u201cgreed on Enron\u2019s\npart\u201d caused the company\u2019s collapse; and that \u201ca lot of people were\nhurt financially.\u201d Supp. App. 26sa\u201330sa. During questioning, he\nstated that he would have \u201cno problem\u201d requiring the Government to\nprove its case, but he also told the court that he believed Lay was\n\u201cgreedy\u201d and that corporate executives are often \u201cstretching the\nlegal limits \u2026 . I\u2019m not going to say that they\u2019re all crooks, but,\nyou know.\u201d App. 857a, 854a. Asked whether he would \u201cstar[t] the\ncase with sort of an inkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must\nhave done something illegal,\u201d he offered an indeterminate \u201cnot\nnecessarily.\u201dId., at 857.[Footnote 23]While several seated jurors and alternates did\nnot make specific comments suggesting prejudice, their written and\noral responses were so abbreviated as to make it virtually\nimpossible for the District Court reliably to assess whether they\nharbored any latent biases. Juror 13, for instance, wrote on his\nquestionnaire that he had heard about the Enron cases from the\n\u201c[n]ews.\u201d Supp. App. 42sa. The court questioned him for two\nminutes, during which time he confirmed that he had \u201cheard what\u2019s\non the news, basically,\u201d including \u201cthat the trial had moved from\nthe 17th to the 31st.\u201d He added that the story \u201cwas all over the\nnews on every detail of Enron.\u201d App. 858a\u2013860a. No meaningful\ninformation about his knowledge or attitudes was obtained.\nSimilarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not followed Enron-related\nnews but was aware that \u201c[m]any people lost their jobs.\u201d Supp. App.\n151sa. The court questioned her for less than 90 seconds. During\nthat time, she acknowledged that she had \u201ccaught glimpses\u201d of the\ncoverage and \u201ckn[e]w generally, you know, that the company went\nbankrupt\u201d and that there \u201cwere some employees that went off and did\ntheir own businesses.\u201d App. 969a. Little more was learned.[Footnote 24]In assessing the likelihood that bias lurked\nin the minds of at least some of these seated jurors, I find\ntelling the way in whichvoir direplayed out. When the\nDistrict Court asked the prospective jurors as a group whether they\nhad any reservations about their ability to presume innocence and\nput the Government to its proof, only two answered in the\naffirmative, and both were excused for cause.Id., at\n815a\u2013820a. The District Court\u2019s individual questioning, though\ntruncated, exposed disqualifying prejudices among numerous\nadditional prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns\nabout their impartiality. See n.\u00a07,supra. It thus\nstrikes me as highly likely that at least some of the seated\njurors, despite stating that they could be fair, harbored similar\nbiases that a more probing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf.Yount, 467 U. S., at 1034, n.\u00a010 (holding that the\ntrial court\u2019s \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d 10-dayvoir direassured the jury\u2019s impartiality).[Footnote 25]The majority suggests,ante, at\n17\u201318, 30, that the jury\u2019s decision to acquit Skilling on nine\nrelatively minor insider trading charges confirms its impartiality.\nThis argument, however, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind\nvindictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely believe\nin their own fairness may nevertheless harbor disqualifying\nprejudices. Such jurors may well acquit where evidence is wholly\nlacking, while subconsciously resolving closer calls against the\ndefendant rather than giving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf.United Statesv.McVeigh, 918 F.\u00a0Supp. 1467,\n1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (prejudice \u201cmay go unrecognized in those who\nare affected by it. The prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not\nlimited to a bias or discriminatory attitude. It includes an\nimpairment of the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from\nevidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to something not\nincluded in the evidence. That something has its most powerful\neffect if it generates strong emotional responses\u201d). In this\nregard, it is significant that the Government placed relatively\nlittle emphasis on the nine insider trading counts during its\nclosing argument, declining to explain its theory on all but one of\nthe counts in any detail whatsoever. Record 37010. The acquittals\non those counts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of\nprejudice.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In sum, I cannot accept the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion thatvoir diregave the District\nCourt \u201ca sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.\u201d Cf.ante, at 29. Taken together, the District Court\u2019s failure\nto cover certain vital subjects, its superficial coverage of other\ntopics, and its uncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality\nleave me doubtful that Skilling\u2019s jury was indeed free from the\ndeep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at large.\n\u201c[R]egardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent\nguilt of the offender[,] or the station in life which he occupies,\u201d\nour system of justice demands trials that are fair in both\nappearance and fact.Irvin, 366 U.

In a business time frame, Enron\npancaked faster than the twin towers\u201d);id., at 1163a\n(noting that \u201cSkilling\u2019s picture turned up alongside Osama bin\nLaden\u2019s on \u2018Wanted\u2019 posters inside the company headquarters\u201d).Footnote 12Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling\ntestified before Congress, and other Enron executives invoked their\nFifth Amendment rights; Enron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted,\ntried, convicted, and sentenced on charges of obstruction of\njustice; the Enron Task Force charged Enron CFO and\nSkilling-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Andrew Fastow with fraud, money laundering, and\nother crimes; and at least two Enron employees pleaded guilty on\nfraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task Force indicted\nnumerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr. (the company\u2019s\ntreasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant treasurer),\nand more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband Services;\nseveral Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received prison\nsentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan. In\n2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and\nCausey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding\nLay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees\nentered guilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch\nbankers were defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an\nEnron deal involving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a\n3-month trial was held in Houston for five executives of Enron\nBroadband Services; various pretrial proceedings occurred in the\nrun up to the trial of Skilling, Lay, and Causey; and, three weeks\nbefore the scheduled trial date, Causey pleaded guilty to\nsecurities fraud.Footnote 13The majority points out that the jury\nselection processes in the three previous Enron trials that had\nbeen held in Houston were similarly brief. Seeante, at\n23. The circumstances of those cases, however, were very different.\nIn particular, the defendants had not been personally subjected to\nanything approaching the withering public criticism that had been\ndirected at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see,e.g.,supra, at 25\u201326, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that\nwas widely seen as the climactic event of the Enron saga.\nAccordingly, my conclusion that the jury selection process in this\nunusual case did not suffice to select an impartial jury does not\ncast doubt on the adequacy of the processes used in the earlier\nEnron prosecutions.Moreover, in referencing the length of thevoir direin this case, I do not mean to suggest that\nlength should be a principal measure of the adequacy of a jury\nselection process. Trial courts, including this one, should be\ncommended for striving to be efficient, but they must always take\ncare to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a\ndefendant\u2019s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect\nto court-led versus attorney-ledvoir dire. Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives district courts discretion to\nchoose between these options, and I have no doubt that either is\ncapable of producing an impartial jury even in high profile cases\nso long as the trial court assures that the scope of thevoir\ndireis tailored to the circumstances.Footnote 14Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to\nthe District Court\u2019s question about whether he \u201crecall[ed]\nlistening to any particular programs about the case.\u201d App. 888a.\nJuror 96, meanwhile, told the court that he read the \u201cwhole\u201d\nHouston Chronicle every day, including \u201call the articles about\nEnron.\u201dId., at 992a. The court, however, did not ask any\nquestions designed to elicit information about the Causey plea.\nInstead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling\u2019s\ncounsel managed to squeeze in a follow-up as to whether he had\n\u201cread about any guilty pleas in this case over the last month or\ntwo.\u201dId., at 993a.Footnote 15Portions of thevoir diretranscript\nerroneously refer to this prospective juror as \u201cJuror 110.\u201d See,e.g.,id., at 996a.Footnote 16The court\u2019s exchange with Juror 20 (who sat\non the jury) is typical:\u201cQ. Do you remember reading any particular\narticles about this case or Mr. Lay or Mr. Skilling?\u201cA. Not until just recently this week, but\nnothing\u2014\u201cQ. And there have been a lot of articles this\nweek.\u201cA. Yeah.\u201cQ. Do you recall any particular articles\nyou\u2019ve read in the last week or so?\u201cA. Not word for word, no.\u201cQ. Did you read all the articles in the\nSunday \u201cChronicle\u201d?\u201cA. Some of them.\u201cQ. Which ones do you remember reading?\u201cA. The one about the trial, I think, and how\nthe trial was going to work.\u201dId., at 873a\u2013874a.Footnote 17The majority\u2019s criticism of Skilling\u2019s\ncounsel for failing to ask questions of many of the prospective\njurors, cf.ante, at 23\u201324, is thus misplaced. Given the\nDistrict Court\u2019s express warning early in thevoir direthat it would not allow counsel \u201cto ask individual questions if\n[they] abuse[d]\u201d that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be\nblamed for declining to test the court\u2019s boundaries at every turn.\nMoreover, the court\u2019s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors\noften gave counsel no clear avenue for further permissible\ninquiry.Footnote 18Although the District Court underestimated\nthe extent of the community hostility, it was certainly aware of\nthe ubiquity of the pretrial publicity, acknowledging that \u201call of\nus have been exposed to substantial media attention about this\ncase.\u201dId., at 841a. The court even made an offhand remark\nabout one of the prior Enron prosecutions, \u201cthe Nigerian barge\ncase,\u201d apparently expecting that the prospective jurors would\nunderstand the reference.Id., at 840a.Footnote 19Taking a more defendant-favorable line than\nmost prospective jurors, Juror 17 stated that he \u201cthought the guy\n[on the radio] was pretty narrow minded,\u201d that \u201ceveryone should be\nconsidered innocent totally until they get a chance to come [to]\ncourt,\u201d and that the Government might have been overzealous in some\nof its Enron-related prosecutions.Id., at 863a\u2013864a. He\nadded, however, that he \u201cbelieve[d] there was probably some\naccounting fraud [at Enron].\u201dId., at 864a. The District\nCourt denied the Government\u2019s request to remove Juror 17 for cause,\nbut he did not ultimately sit on the jury.Footnote 20The majority attempts to downplay the\nsignificance of Juror 29 by noting that she did not end up on the\njury because Skilling used a peremptory challenge to remove her.\nSeeante, at 30, n. 32. The majority makes a similar point\nwith respect to other venire members who were not ultimately\nseated. Seeante, at 24, n. 24. The comments of these\nvenire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impartiality\nof the seated jurors, who were similarly \u201cpart of a community\ndeeply hostile to the accused\u201d and who may have been \u201cunwittingly\ninfluenced by it.\u201dMurphyv.Florida,421\nU. S. 794, 803 (1975); see alsoIrvinv.Dowd,366 U. S. 717, 728 (1961). Moreover,\nthe fact that the District Court failed to remove persons as\ndubiously qualified as Juror 29 goes directly to the adequacy of\nitsvoir dire. If Juror 29 made it through to the end of\nthe selection process, it is difficult to have confidence in the\nimpartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how little is\nknown about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave \u00a723.2(f), at 288 (\u201cThe\nresponses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the\nseated jurors who were familiar with the same publicity\u201d).Footnote 21The majority also notes that about two-thirds\nof the seated jurors and alternates (11 of 16) had no personal\nEnron connection.Ante, at 24, and n.\u00a025. This means,\nof course, that five of the seated jurors and alternates did have\nconnections to friends or colleagues who had lost jobs or money as\na result of Enron\u2019s collapse\u2014a fact that does not strike me as\nparticularly reassuring.Footnote 22As one of Skilling\u2019s jury experts observed,\nthere is a \u201ctendency in voir dire of jury pool members in\nhigh-profile cases to minimize their exposure to media, their\nknowledge of prejudicial information, and any biases they may\nhave.\u201d App. 763a; see alsoid., at 637a (\u201cThose who\nperceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are\nreluctant to admit they cannot be fair\u201d). For this reason, the fact\nthat \u201cnone of the seated jurors and alternates checked the \u2018yes\u2019\nbox\u201d on the written questionnaire when \u201casked whether they \u2018ha[d]\nan opinion about [Skilling],\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 26, is of\nminimal significance, particularly given that the Causey plea and\nthe impending trial received significant media coverageafterthe questionnaires were submitted.Footnote 23Many other seated jurors and alternates\nexpressed similarly troubling sentiments. See,e.g., Supp.\nApp. 57sa\u201360sa (Juror 20) (obtained Enron-related news from the\nChronicle and \u201clocal news stations\u201d; blamed Enron\u2019s collapse on\n\u201c[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective audit procedures to\nprevent mismanagement of corporate assets\u201d; and was \u201cangry that so\nmany people lost their jobs and their retirement savings\u201d);id., at 72sa\u201375sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news\nfrom various sources, including the Chronicle; was \u201cangry about\nwhat happened\u201d; and \u201cfe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and\ninvested in the corp[oration] only to have it all taken away\u201d);id., at 117sa\u2013118sa (Juror 64) (had several friends who\nworked at Enron and lost money; heard about the Enron cases on the\nnews; described the collapse as \u201csad\u201d because \u201cpeople lost jobs\n[and] money\u2014lots of money\u201d; and believed the Government \u201cdid the\nright thing\u201d in its investigation);id., at 177sa\u2013181sa\n(Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the Chronicle, Channel\n13 news, the O\u2019Reilly Factor, Internet news sources, and friends,\nfamily, and co-workers; attributed Enron\u2019s collapse to \u201c[p]oor\nmanagement [and] bad judgment\u2014greed\u201d; lamented \u201c[t]he sad state of\nthe long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their\nretirement accounts\u201d; and \u201cadmire[d] [the] bravery\u201d of Enron\nwhistle-blower Sherron Watkins \u201cfor bringing the situation to the\nattention of the public, which stopped things from getting worse\u201d);id., at 191sa\u2013195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news\nfrom his wife, co-workers, and television; wrote that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not\nright for someone \u2026 to take\u201d away the money that the \u201csmall average\nworker saves \u2026 for retirement all his life\u201d; and described the\nGovernment\u2019s Enron investigation as \u201ca good thing\u201d);id.,\nat 221sa\u2013225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information about Enron from a\n\u201cco-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs. Fastow\u2019s trial\u201d;\nworked for an employer who lost money as a result of Enron\u2019s\ncollapse; found it \u201csad\u201d that the collapse had affected \u201csuch a\nhuge number of people\u201d; and thought \u201csomeone had to be doing\nsomething illegal\u201d);id., at 236sa\u2013237sa (Juror 116) (knew\na colleague who lost money in Enron\u2019s collapse; obtained\nEnron-related news from the \u201cHouston Chronicle, Time Magazine,\nlocal TV news [and] radio, friends, family, [and] co-workers, [and]\ninternet news sources\u201d; and noted that what stood out was \u201c[t]he\nemployees and retirees that lost their savings\u201d).Footnote 24Several other jurors fell into this category.\nJuror 67 wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about Enron\nfrom the Chronicle and \u201cInternet news sources.\u201dId., at\n133sa. He was questioned for 90 seconds, during which time he\nindicated that he had read an article on the Internet the preceding\nnight \u201cabout the jury selection taking place today, stuff like\nthat.\u201d App. 944a. Juror 99 wrote that she had not heard or read\nabout the Enron cases and did not \u201cknow anything about\u201d Enron.\nSupp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely one\nminute. She stated that she had \u201c[n]ot really\u201d learned more about\nthe case, but added that she had heard \u201cthis and that\u201d from her\nparents. App. 995a\u2013996a. The court did not press further.Footnote 25The majority suggests that the fact that\nSkilling \u201cchallenged only one of the seated jurors for cause\u201d\nindicates that he did not believe the other jurors were biased.Ante, at 31. Our decisions, however, distinguish claims\ninvolving \u201cthe partiality of an individual juror\u201d from antecedent\nclaims directed at \u201cthe partiality of the trial jury as a whole.\u201dPattonv.Yount,467\nU. S. 1025, 1036 (1984); see alsoFrazierv.United States,335 U. S. 497, 514\n(1948) (\u201c[T]he two sorts of challenge[s] are distinct and are\ntherefore to be dealt with separately\u201d). If the jury selection\nprocess does not, as here, give a defendant a fair opportunity to\nidentify biased jurors, the defendant can hardly be faulted for\nfailing to make for-cause challenges.",
