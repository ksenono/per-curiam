I, \u00a71, and does not permit Congress to\ndelegate them to another branch of the Government. SeeWhitmanv.American Trucking Assns.,Inc.,531 U.S.\n457, 472 (2001). Nevertheless, since 1935, the Court has\nuniformly rejected nondelegation arguments and has upheld\nprovisions that authorized agencies to adopt important rules\npursuant to extraordinarily capacious standards. Seeibid.If a majority of this Court were willing to\nreconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years, I\nwould support that effort. But because a majority is not willing to\ndo that, it would be freakish to single out the provision at issue\nhere for special treatment.Because I cannot say that the statute lacks a\ndiscern- able standard that is adequate under the approach this\nCourt has taken for many years, I vote to affirm.",
