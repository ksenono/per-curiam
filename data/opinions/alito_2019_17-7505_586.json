    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u20137505_________________VERNON MADISON, PETITIONERv.ALABAMAon writ of certiorari to the circuit court of\nalabama, mobile county[February 27, 2019]Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and\nJustice Gorsuch join, dissenting.What the Court has done in this case makes a\nmockery of our Rules.Petitioner\u2019s counsel convinced the Court to stay\nhis client\u2019s execution and to grant his petition for a writ of\ncertiorari for the purpose of deciding a clear-cut constitutional\nquestion: Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit the execution of a\nmurderer who cannot recall committing the murder for which the\ndeath sentence was imposed? The petition strenuously argued that\nexecuting such a person is unconstitutional.After persuading the Court to grant review of\nthis question, counsel abruptly changed course. Perhaps because he\nconcluded (correctly) that petitioner was unlikely to prevail on\nthe question raised in the petition, he conceded that the argument\nadvanced in his petition was wrong, and he switched to an entirely\ndifferent argument, namely, that the state court had rejected\npetitioner\u2019s claim that he is incompetent to be executed because\nthe court erroneously thought that dementia, as opposed to other\nmental conditions, cannot provide a basis for such a claim. See\nBrief for Petitioner 16.This was not a question that the Court agreed to\nhear; indeed, there is no mention whatsoever of this argument in\nthe petition\u2014not even a hint. Nor is this question fairly included\nwithin those on which the Court granted review. On the contrary, it\nis an entirely discrete and independent question.Counsel\u2019s tactics flagrantly flouted our Rules.\nOur Rules make it clear that we grant certiorari to decide the\nspecific question or questions of law set out in a petition for\ncertiorari. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a) (\u201cOnly the questions set\nout in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered\nby the Court\u201d). Our whole certiorari system would be thrown into\nturmoil if we allowed counsel to obtain review of one question and\nthen switch to an entirely different question after review is\ngranted. In the past when counsel have done this, we have dismissed\nthe writ as improvidently granted. See,e.g.,Visa,\nInc.v.Osborn, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016);City and\nCounty of San Franciscov.Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015). We should do that here.Instead, the majority rewards counsel\u2019s trick.\nIt vacates the judgment below because it is unsure whether the\nstate court committed the error claimed in petitioner\u2019s merits\nbrief. But not only was there no trace of this argument in the\npetition, there is nothing in the record showing that the state\ncourt ever adopted the erroneous view that petitioner claims it\ntook.IThe question on which we granted review was an\noutgrowth of ourper curiamdecision inDunnv.Madison, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which concerned an\nEleventh Circuit decision granting petitioner federal habeas\nrelief. Prior to that decision, this Court had held inFordv.Wainwright,477 U.S.\n399(1986), that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution\nof a person who is \u201cinsane,\u201d and inPanettiv.Quarterman,551 U.S.\n930(2007), the Court elaborated on this rule, explaining that\na person cannot be executed if he lacks a rational understanding of\nthe reason for the execution. The Eleventh Circuit interpreted\nthose cases to mean that petitioner could not be executed because\nhe did not remember killing his victim, Mobile, Alabama, police\nofficer Julius Schulte.We summarily reversed. Under the relevant\nprovision of the federal habeas statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d), which was enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), petitioner could not\nobtain federal habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s rejection of\nhis memory-loss claim represented an unreasonable application of\nfederal law as clearly established at the time by decisions of this\nCourt. We held that neitherFordnorPanetticlearly\nestablished that a person cannot be executed if he does not\nremember committing the crime for which the death sentence was\nimposed.Our opinion stated, however, that it\n\u201cexpress[ed] no view on the merits of the underlying question\noutside of the AEDPA context.\u201dDunn, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4). And a concurring opinion authored by Justice\nGinsburg and joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor teed up this\nquestion for review in a later case.Id.,at ___ (slip op.,\nat 1) (\u201cThe issue whether a State may administer the death penalty\nto a person whose disability leaves him without memory of his\ncommission of a capital offense is a substantial question not yet\naddressed by the Court. Appropriately presented, the issue would\nwarrant full airing\u201d).Taking this cue, petitioner then sought relief\nin state court based on his inability to remember his crime, and\nwhen that effort failed, he filed the petition at issue now.IIThe centerpiece of the petition and\npetitioner\u2019s 11th-hour application for a stay of execution[1] was the argument that he could not\nconstitutionally be executed because he did not remember killing\nOfficer Schulte. The petition repeatedly noted petitioner\u2019s\ninability to remember his crime. See Pet. for Cert. i, iii, 1, 2,\n8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. And the petition was\nvery clear about the question on which review was sought:\u201c[T]his case presents this Court with the\nappropriate vehicle to consider the substantial question of whether\nthe execution of a prisoner with no memory of the underlying\noffense is consistent with the evolving standards of decency\ninherent in this Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\u201dId.,at 2.This same point was made time and again:\u25cf\u201c[B]ecause [petitioner\u2019s] disability renders\nhim unable to remember the underlying offense for which he is to be\npunished, his execution does not comport with the evolving\nstandards of decency required by this Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence.\u201dId.,at 18.\u25cf\u201c[I]mposing death on a prisoner, who, like Mr.\nMadison, suffers from substantial memory deficits by virtue of\nmultiple stroke and resulting vascular dementia serves no\nretributive or deterrent purpose.\u201dId.,at 22.\u25cf\u201c[E]xecuting an individual with no memory of\nthe underlying offense serves no retributive purpose.\u201dIbid.\u25cf\u201c[W]here the person being punished has no\nmemory of the commission of the offense for which he is to be\nexecuted, the \u2018moral quality\u2019 of that punishment is lessened and\nunable to match outrage over the offense.\u201dId.,at\n22\u201323.\u25cf\u201cMr. Madison\u2019s severe memory impairments as a\nresult of vascular dementia render him incompetent to be executed\nunder the Eight Amendment.\u201dId.,at 25 (quotation\naltered).In sum, the body of the petition makes it clear\nthat review was sought on the question invited by theDunnconcurrence, and the thrust of the wording of the two questions was\nthe same. They read as follows:\u201c1.\u2002Consistent with the Eighth Amendment, and\nthis Court\u2019s decisions inFordandPanetti, may the\nState execute a prisoner whose mental disability leaves him without\nmemory of his commission of the capital offense? SeeDunnv.Madison, [583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Ginsburg, J.,\njoined by Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring).]\u201c2.\u2002Do evolving standards of decency and the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment bar\nthe execution of a prisoner whose competency has been compromised\nby vascular dementia and multiple strokes causing severe cognitive\ndysfunction and a degenerative medical condition which prevents him\nfrom remembering the crime for which he was convicted or\nunderstanding the circumstances of his scheduled execution?\u00a0\u201d\nPet. for Cert. iii.With the exception of the final phrase in\nquestion two (\u201cor understanding the circumstances of his scheduled\nexecution\u201d), both questions solely concern the effect of memory\nloss on an Eighth Amendment analysis. The final phrase in question\ntwo and certain passages in the petition, if read with an\nexceedingly generous eye,mightbe seen as a basis for\nconsidering whether the evidence in the state-court record shows\nthat petitioner\u2019s dementia rendered him incapable of having a\nrational understanding of the reason for his execution. But that is\nthe sort of factbound question on which we rarely grant review, see\nthis Court\u2019s Rule 10, and it is questionable whether we did so\nhere.But whether or not the petition may be fairly\nread to present that factbound question, it is a travesty to read\nit as challenging the state-court order on the ground that the\nstate court erroneously believed that dementia cannot provide a\nbasis for aFord/Panetticlaim. There is no inkling\nof that argument in the petition. Although the petition described\nthe state-court order at numerous places, the petition never\nclaimed that the order was based on an impermissible distinction\nbetween dementia and other mental conditions. See,e.g.,Pet. for Cert. ii, 2\u20133, 16. And in fact, there is a point in the\npetition where such an interpretation of the state-court order\nwould surely have been mentioned if the petition had intended to\nraise it as a ground for review. The petition noted that \u201ccourts\nhave recognized dementia and attendant cognitive decline and memory\nimpairment as a basis for a finding of incompetency to be\nexecuted,\u201did.,at 25, but the petition did not follow that\nstatement by claiming that the state court in this case took a\ncontradictory position.Because the petition did not raise\u2014indeed, did\nnot even hint at\u2014the argument on which the Court now grants relief,\nthe Court\u2019s decision is insupportable.[2] It violates our Rule that \u201c[o]nly the questions set out\nin the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by\nthe Court.\u201d See Rule 14.1(a).IIIEven if it were proper for us to consider\nwhether the order below was based on an erroneous distinction\nbetween dementia and other mental conditions, there is little\nreason to think that it was. After a full evidentiary hearing in\n2016, the state court rejected petitioner\u2019sFord/Panetticlaim based on a correct statement of\nthe holding of those decisions. It found that petitioner \u201cha[d] not\ncarried his burden [of showing] by a preponderance of the evidence\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that he .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not rationally\nunderstand the punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about\nto suffer it.\u201d Order (Apr. 29, 2016), p.\u00a010. The court\u2019s order\nwent on to say that it \u201cspecifically [found] that Madison has a\nrationa[l] understanding, as required byPanetti, that he is\ngoing to be executed because of the murder he committed and a\nrationa[l] understanding that the State is seeking retribution and\nthat he will die when he is executed.\u201dIbid.In concluding that the state court might have\ndrawn a distinction between dementia and other mental conditions,\nthe majority seizes upon the wording of the order issued after a\nsubsequent hearing in 2018.Ante,at 14. In that order, the\nsame judge wrote: \u201cDefendant did not provide a substantial\nthreshold showing ofinsanity, a requirement set out by the\nUnited States Supreme Court, sufficient to convince this Court to\nstay the execution.\u201d Order (Jan. 16, 2018), p.\u00a01 (emphasis\nadded). The majority worries that the state-court judge might not\nhave applied the same standard in 2018 as he had two years earlier\nand might have viewed \u201cinsanity\u201d as something narrower than the\nstandard mandated byFordandPanetti. This concern\nis unfounded.Taken out of context, the term \u201cinsanity\u201d might\nnot be read to encompass dementia, but in context, it is apparent\nthat the state court\u2019s use of that term was based on the way in\nwhich it was used inFordandPanetti. The state\ncourt did not simply refer to \u201cinsanity.\u201d It referred to \u201cinsanity,\na requirement set out by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Thus, it\nfollowed the term \u201cinsanity\u201d with an appositive, which is a word or\nphrase that renames the word or phrase that precedes it. In other\nwords, what the state court clearly meant by \u201cinsanity\u201d was what\nthis Court termed insanity inFordandPanetti. What\nwas that?InFord, the Court held that the Eighth\nAmendment prohibits the execution of a person who is \u201cinsane,\u201d and\nin the portion of Justice Marshall\u2019s lead opinion that was joined\nby a plurality, Justice Marshall equated insanity with a mental\ncondition that \u201cprevents [a person] from comprehending the reasons\nfor the penalty or its implications.\u201d 477 U.\u00a0S., at 417.\nJustice Powell, who provided the fifth vote for the decision, took\na similar position. Seeid.,at 422\u2013423 (opinion concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment). InPanetti, which built\non the holding inFord, the Court used the term in a similar\nway. See 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958\u2013960. Accordingly, a defendant\nsuffers from \u201cinsanity,\u201d as the term is used inFordandPanetti, if the prisoner does not understand the reason for\nhis execution.Today\u2019s decision does not reject this\ninterpretation of the state-court order; it says only that it is\nvacating and remanding because it is \u201cat the least unsure\u201d whether\nthe state court used the term \u201cinsanity\u201d in this way.Ante,at 14. The majority cites two reasons for its uncertainty, but both\nare weak.First, the majority attributes to the state\ncourt an interpretation of the term \u201cinsanity\u201d that was advanced by\nthe State in this Court in its brief in opposition to the petition\nfor certiorari.Ante,at 15. In that submission, the State\nargued that certiorari should be denied because petitioner had\nsought relief in state court under the wrong provision of state\nlaw, namely, Ala. Code \u00a715\u201316\u201323 (2011), which authorizes the\nsuspension of the execution of an inmate who is \u201cinsane.\u201d The State\nargued that petitioner\u2019s memory loss did not render him \u201cinsane\u201d\nwithin the meaning of this statute and that if he wished to argue\nthat the Eighth Amendment bars the execution of an inmate who\ncannot remember his crime, he \u201cshould have filed a petition for\npost-conviction relief\u201d under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure\n32.4. Brief in Opposition 11\u201312.The majority\u2019s argument based on the State\u2019s\nbrief in opposition suffers from multiple defects. For one thing,\nnothing suggests that the state court rejected petitioner\u2019s\napplication on the ground that he invoked the wrong provision of\nstate law; the State\u2019s filing in the state court made no mention of\nthe argument set out in its brief in opposition filed here.\nMoreover, if the state court had rejected petitioner\u2019s application\non the ground that he moved under the wrong provision of state law,\nit is doubtful that we could review that decision, for then it\nwould appear to rest on an adequate and independent state-law\nground. And to top things off, the majority\u2019s argument distorts\nwhat the State\u2019s brief in opposition attempted to say about the\nterm \u201cinsane.\u201d The State did not argue that a defendant who lacks a\nrational understanding of the reason for his execution due to\ndementia is not \u201cinsane\u201d under Ala. Code \u00a715\u201316\u201323. Instead, the\nState\u2019s point was that a defendant is not \u201cinsane\u201d in that sense\nmerely because he cannot remember committing the crime for which he\nwas convicted.The majority\u2019s other proffered basis for doubt\nis that the State \u201crepeatedly argued to the [state] court (over\nMadison\u2019s objection) that only prisoners suffering from delusional\ndisorders could qualify as incompetent underPanetti.\u201dAnte,at 16. The majority, however, cites no place where the\nState actually made such an argument. To be sure, the State, in\ncontending that petitioner was not entitled to relief underFordandPanetti, argued strenuously that he was not\ndelusional. (The State made this argument because petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel claimed that petitioner was in fact delusional and fell\nwithinFordandPanettifor that reason.[3]) But arguing, as the State did, that\npetitioner was not entitled to relief because the claim that he was\ndelusional was untrue is not the same as arguing that petitioner\ncould be executed even if his dementia rendered him incapable of\nunderstanding the reason for his execution. The majority cites no\nplace where the State made the latter argument in the state\ncourt.[4] And even if the State\nhad made such an argument, what matters is the basis for the state\ncourt\u2019s decision, not what counsel for the State wrote or said.I add one more comment regarding the majority\u2019s\nuncertainty about the basis for the state-court decision: Our\ndecision two years ago inDunnevinced no similar doubts.\nThere, we said that the state court \u201cheld that, under this Court\u2019s\ndecisions inFordandPanetti, Madison was en- titled\nto relief if he could show\u201d that he lacks a rational understanding\nof the circumstances of his punishment. 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 2) (quotation altered). And we said that the state\ncourt \u201cdetermined that Madison is competent to be executed\nbecause\u2014notwithstanding his memory loss\u2014he recognizes that he will\nbe put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have\ncommitted.\u201dId.,at ___ (slip op., at 4); see alsoibid.(referring to the state court\u2019s \u201cfinding that Madison\nunderstands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and\nthat Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime\u201d).\nWhy the majority cannot now see what it understood without any\napparent difficulty two years ago is hard to grasp.For all these reasons, what the Court has done\nin this case cannot be defended, and therefore it is hard to escape\nthinking that the real reason for today\u2019s decision is doubt on the\npart of the majority regarding the correctness of the state court\u2019s\nfactual finding on the question whether Madison has a rational\nunderstanding of the reason for his execution. There is no question\nthat petitioner suffers from severe physical and mental problems,\nand the question whether he is capable of understanding the reason\nfor his execution was vigorously litigated below. But if the Court\nthinks it is proper for us to reach that question and to reverse\nthe state court\u2019s finding based on a cold record, it should own up\nto what it is doing.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Petitioner has abandoned the question on which\nhe succeeded in persuading the Court to grant review, and it is\nhighly improper for the Court to grant him relief on a ground not\neven hinted at in his petition. The writ should be dismissed as\nimprovidently granted, and I therefore respectfully dissent.Notes1Petitioner sought and\nobtained a stay of execution based on this same argument. See\nApplication for Stay of Execution 2, 6 (moving the Court to stay\npetitioner\u2019s execution so that it could address the \u201csubstantial\u201d\nand \u201ccritical\u201d question whether executing petitioner, \u201cwhose severe\ncognitive dysfunction leaves him without memory of his commission\nof the capital offense,\u201d would violate the Eighth\nAmendment).2The Court is unable to\ncite a single place in the petition that makes any reference to the\nargument that the state court failed to understand that dementia\ncould satisfy theFord/Panettitest.3Petitioner\u2019s papers\nemphasized again and again that he suffers from delusions. See Pet.\nfor Suspension in No. CC\u201385\u20131385.80 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Feb.\n12, 2016), p.\u00a01 (\u201cMr. Madison has long suffered from serious\nmental illness, marked by paranoid delusions and other\ndisabilities\u201d);id., at 5 (\u201cAt Mr. Madison\u2019s trial, Dr.\nBarry Amyx established that Mr. Madison suffers from a delusional\ndisorder that has existed since he was an adolescent\u201d);ibid.(\u201cThis well-documented history of paranoia was one of\nthe reasons Dr. Amyx concluded that Mr. Madison had a delusional\ndisorder in a paranoid, really a persecutory type\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted));ibid.(\u201cDr. Amyx noted that Mr.\nMadison exhibited delusional thinking about .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmedication and believed that he was being used as a guinea pig in\nmedical experiments\u201d);id., at 6 (emphasizing a \u201cmore recent\nobservation\u201d that \u201c\u00a0\u2018Mr. Madison consistently presented with\nparanoid delusions\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at 8 (\u201cMr. Madison\nexhibited delusional and disoriented behavior in June 2015\u201d);id., at 14 (\u201cdecades of delusional thinking and psychotropic\nmedications\u201d); see also Pet. for Suspension in No. CC\u201385\u20131385.80\n(C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Dec. 18, 2017), pp. 6\u20137 (detailing\nsimilar statements). This line of argument fell apart when\npetitioner\u2019s own expert testified that he found no indication that\npetitioner was \u201c[e]ither delusional or psychotic.\u201d Tr. 56 (Apr. 14,\n2016).4Unable to cite any place\nwhere the State made this argument to the state court, the Court\nclaims that the State did so in the Eleventh Circuit.Ante,at 6\u20137, n.\u00a01. But even if that were so, it is hard to see what\nthat would have to do with the question whether the state court\nthought that dementia could not satisfy theFord/Panettitest. And in any event, the Court does\nnot fairly describe the State\u2019s argument in the Eleventh Circuit.\nThe State\u2019s Eleventh Circuit brief argued that merely suffering\nfrom a mental condition like dementia is not enough to render a\nprisoner incompetent to be executed; instead, the prisoner must\nalso establish that he lacks a rational understanding of the reason\nfor his execution. See Brief for Appellee in No. 16\u201312279 (CA11),\npp. 37\u201338 (Brief for Appellee) (\u201cThe fairest reading of the state\ncourt\u2019s opinion is that it assumed that dementia and memory loss\ncaused by strokes is a mental illness and went straight to the\nrational understanding question. Thus, it is not that the trial\ncourt refused to consider Madison\u2019s claims pertaining to\ndementia\u2014Madison cannot point to any portion of the state court\norder that says this\u2014it is that the trial court correctly noted\nthat Madison failed to prove that any dementia interfered with\nMadison\u2019s ability to have a rational understanding of his\nexecution, including the reasons therefor\u201d);id.,at 27\n(\u201cThe Supreme Court has not held that a petitioner can show\nincompetence without demonstrating a mental illness or that\ndementia and memory loss definitively preclude rational\nunderstanding\u201d);id.,at 29 (\u201cTo the extent the state court\nfollowed the lead of the Supreme Court, this Court, and the ABA and\nrequired Madison to show that a mental illness prevented him from\nhaving a rational understanding of his punishment, doing so was not\nan unreasonable application of clearly established federal law\u201d).\nIt is true that the State\u2019s brief, in addressing the standard for\ngranting federal habeas relief under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72254(d), stated that this Court \u201cha[d] never held that dementia or\nmemory loss is sufficient to show a lack of rational\nunderstanding,\u201d Brief for Appellee 29, but that was because a claim\nunder \u00a72254(d) must be based on a clearly established Supreme Court\nholding. See Recording of Oral Arg. in No. 16\u201312279 (CA11, June 23,\n2016), at \u00a032:37\u201333:30 (State rejecting a suggestion thatPanettiholds \u201cif you don\u2019t remember committing the crime at\nall, and it is clear based on the medical testimony that you don\u2019t\nremember committing this crime, then you don\u2019t have\u00a0 a\nrational understanding of the factual basis for the imposition of\nthe death penalty\u201d: \u201cFirst of all, under AEDPA deference, I think\nthat that is not the holding ofPanetti. . . .\u00a0 I think\nunder AEDPA deference, it\u2019s pretty clear that the holding ofPanettiis very narrow. . . .\u00a0 I would say the holding\ninPanettiis that documented mental illness that results in\na delusion has to be considered when talking about rational\nunderstanding\u201d);id.,at 36:00\u201336:30 (\u201cI think the Supreme\nCourt has never held that not remembering something is equivalent\nto not having a rational understanding.\u00a0 I think that is just\nundeniably true.\u00a0 And if AEDPA deference applies, then I don\u2019t\nthink the state court could have been unreasonable in rejecting the\nview that memory is required\u201d).\u00a0 The State did not argue\neither that dementia cannot satisfyFordandPanettior that the state court based its decision on that ground. On the\ncontrary, Alabama wrote that \u201ceven if the trial court had\ndetermined that dementia and severe memory loss\u2014or even total\namnesia\u2014are insufficient to meet the rational understanding test,\nthat finding would not contradict clearly established federal law.\u201d\nBrief for Appellee 29; see alsoid.,at 30 (\u201cEven assuming\nthe state court held, as a matter of law, that amnesia is not\nsufficient to show a lack of rational understanding, that\ndetermination was not unreasonable in light of clearly established\nfederal law\u201d). The majority acknowledges that the State made this\nconcededly correct habeas argument, but then oddly writes it off as\nan \u201cadditional\u201d or alternative argument.Ante,at 7,\nn. 1.\u00a0 Yet, as the State\u2019s brief and oral argument illustrate,\nthe State\u2019s core contention was that the state court did not\nunreasonably apply clearly established law underPanetti\u2019s\n\u201cvery narrow\u201d holding.\u00a0 (And as we later held inDunn,\nthe State was correct.)The majority simply cannot\nescape the inconvenient fact that the State never argued, as a\nnon-AEDPA matter, that peti-tioner could be executed even if his\ndementia precluded a rational understanding.",
