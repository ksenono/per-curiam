S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1314DELBERT WILLIAMSON, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.MAZDA MOTOR OF AMERICA, INC., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of\ncali-fornia, fourth appellate district, division three[February 23, 2011]Justice Sotomayor,\nconcurring.As the Court notes, this is not\nthe first case in which the Court has encountered the express\npre-emption provision and saving clause of the National Traffic and\nMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71381et seq.(1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive\nchange at 49 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730101et seq.(2006 ed. and\nSupp. III)). InGeierv.American Honda Motor\nCo.,529 U. S.\n861(2000), the Court concluded that the \u201csaving clause (like\nthe express pre-emption provision) doesnotbar the\nordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles,\u201did.,\nat 869, and therefore engaged in an implied pre-emption analysis.\nThe majority and dissent inGeieragreed that \u201ca court\nshould not find pre-emption too readily in the absence of clear\nevidence of a conflict.\u201dId.,at 885.I agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of this\ncase and with its reasoning. I write separately only to emphasize\nthe Court\u2019s rejection of an overreading ofGeierthat has\ndeveloped since that opinion was issued.Geierdoes not stand, as the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal, 167 Cal. App. 4th 905, 918\u2013919, 84 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 545, 555\u2013556 (2008), other courts, and some of\nrespondents\u2019amiciseem to believe, for the proposition\nthat any time an agency gives manufacturers a choice between two or\nmore options, a tort suit that imposes liability on the basis of\none of the options is an obstacle to the achievement of a federal\nregulatory objective and may be pre-empted.* Rather,Geierturned on the fact that the agency, via Federal Motor Vehicle\nSafety Standard 208, \u201cdeliberately sought variety\u2014a mix of several\ndifferent passive restraint systems.\u201d 529 U. S., at 878;ante, at 7. As the United States notes, \u201ca conflict\nresults only when the Safety Act (or regulations implementing the\nSafety Act) does not just set out options for compliance, but also\nprovides that the regulated parties must remain free to choose\namong those options.\u201d Brief for United States asAmicus\nCuriae8. In other words, the mere fact that an agency\nregulation allows manufacturers a choice between options is\ninsufficient to justify implied pre-emption; courts should only\nfind pre-emption where evidence exists that an agency has a\nregulatory objective\u2014e.g.,obtaining a mix of passive\nrestraint mechanisms, as inGeier\u2014whose achievement\ndepends on manufacturers having a choice between options. A link\nbetween a regulatory objective and the need for manufacturer choice\nto achieve that objective is the lynchpin of implied pre-emption\nwhen there is a saving clause.Absent strong indications from the agency that\nit needs manufacturers to have options in order to achieve a\n\u201csignificant \u2026 regulatory objective,\u201dante, at 5, state\ntort suits are not \u201cobstacle[s] to the accomplishment \u2026 of the full\npurposes and objectives\u201d of federal law,Hinesv.Davidowitz,312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).\nAs the majority explains, the agency here gave no indication that\nits safety goals required the mixture of seatbelt types that\nresulted from manufacturers\u2019 ability to choose different options.Ante, at 8\u201312 (distinguishing the regulatory record in\nthis case from that inGeier).Especially in light of the \u201cstatutory saving\nclause that foresees the likelihood of a continued meaningful role\nfor state tort law,\u201dante, at 11, respondents have not\ncarried their burden of establishing that the agency here\n\u201cdeliberately sought variety\u201d to achieve greater safety,Geier, 529 U. S., at 878. Therefore, the Williamsons\u2019 tort\nsuit does not present an obstacle to any \u201csignificant federal\nregulatory objective,\u201dante, at 5, and may not be\npre-empted.For these reasons, I concur.*See,e.g.,Cardenv.General\nMotors Corp., 509 F.\u00a03d 227, 230\u2013232 (CA5 2007);Griffithv.General Motors Corp., 303 F.\u00a03d\n1276, 1282 (CA11 2002);Heinricherv.Volvo Car\nCorp., 61 Mass.
