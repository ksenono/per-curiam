S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNOS. 06-969 AND 06-970FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, APPELLANT06\u2013969v.WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC.SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, et\u00a0al.,\nAPPELLANTS06\u2013970v.WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC.on appeals from the united states district\ncourt for the district of columbia[June 25, 2007]Chief Justice Robertsannounced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of\nthe Court with respect to Parts I and II, and an opinion with\nrespect to Parts III and IV, in which Justice Alito joins.Section 203 of the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 91, 2 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), makes it a federal crime for any\ncorporation to broadcast, shortly before an election, any\ncommunication that names a federal candidate for elected office and\nis targeted to the electorate. InMcConnellv.Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n,540 U. S. 93(2003), this Court\nconsidered whether \u00a7203 was facially overbroad under the First\nAmendment because it captured within its reach not only campaign\nspeech, or \u201cexpress advocacy,\u201d but also speech about public issues\nmore generally, or \u201cissue advocacy,\u201d that mentions a candidate for\nfederal office. The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth\nconcern to the extent the speech in question was the \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d of express campaign speech.Id., at 204\u2013205,\n206. On the other hand, the Court \u201cassume[d]\u201d that the interests it\nhad found to \u201cjustify the regulation of campaign speech might not\napply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.\u201dId.,at\n206, n. 88. The Court nonetheless determined that \u00a7203 was not\nfacially overbroad. Even assuming \u00a7203 \u201cinhibit[ed] some\nconstitutionally protected corporate and union speech,\u201d the Court\nconcluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to\ncarry their \u201cheavy burden\u201d of establishing thatallenforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.Id.,at 207.Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling,\narising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision inMcConnellleft \u201cno room\u201d for as-applied challenges to\n\u00a7203. App. to Juris. Statement 52a. We held on the contrary that\n\u201c[i]n upholding \u00a7203 against a facial challenge, we did not purport\nto resolve future as-applied challenges.\u201dWisconsin Right to\nLife, Inc.v.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,546 U. S. 410, 411\u2013412\n(2006) (per curiam) (WRTL I).We now confront such an as-applied challenge.\nResolving it requires us first to determine whether the speech at\nissue is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of speech expressly advocating\nthe election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or\ninstead a \u201cgenuine issue a[d].\u201dMcConnell,supra,at 206, and n.\u00a088. We have long recognized that the\ndistinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy \u201cmay often\ndissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially\nincumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving\nlegislative proposals and governmental actions.\u201dBuckleyv.Valeo,424 U. S. 1, 42 (1976) (per\ncuriam). Our development of the law in this area requires us,\nhowever, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the\ninterests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its\n\u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d \u201cmight not apply\u201d to the regulation of\nissue advocacy.McConnell,supra, at 206, and\nn.\u00a088.In drawing that line, the First Amendment\nrequires us to err on the side of protecting political speech\nrather than suppressing it. We conclude that the speech at issue in\nthis as-applied challenge is not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of\nexpress campaign speech. We further conclude that the interests\nheld to justify restricting corporate campaign speech or its\nfunctional equivalent do not justify restricting issue advocacy,\nand accordingly we hold that BCRA \u00a7203 is unconstitutional as\napplied to the advertisements at issue in these cases.IPrior to BCRA, corporations were\nfree under federal law to use independent expenditures to engage in\npolitical speech so long as that speech did not expressly advocate\nthe election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate.\nSeeFederal Election Comm\u2019nv.Massachusetts Citizens\nfor Life, Inc.,479 U. S. 238, 249 (1986)\n(MCFL);Buckley,supra,at 44\u201345; 2 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7441b(a), (b)(2) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV).BCRA significantly cut back on\ncorporations\u2019 ability to engage in political speech. BCRA \u00a7203, at\nissue in these cases, makes it a crime for any labor union or\nincorporated entity\u2014whether the United Steelworkers, the American\nCivil Liberties Union, or General Motors\u2014to use its general\ntreasury funds to pay for any \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d\n\u00a7441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). BCRA\u2019s definition of\n\u201celectioneering communication\u201d is clear and expansive. It\nencompasses any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that\nrefers to a candidate for federal office and that is aired within\n30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal\ngeneral election in the jurisdiction in which that candidate is\nrunning for office. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A).[Footnote 1]Appellee Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL),\nis a nonprofit, nonstock, ideological advocacy corporation\nrecognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax exempt under\n\u00a7501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. On July 26, 2004, as part\nof what it calls a \u201cgrassroots lobbying campaign,\u201d Brief for\nAppellee 8, WRTL began broadcasting a radio advertisement entitled\n\u201cWedding.\u201d The transcript of \u201cWedding\u201d reads as follows:\u201c\u00a0\u2018PASTOR: And who gives\nthis woman to be married to this man?\u201c\u00a0\u2018BRIDE\u2019S FATHER: Well, as father of the\nbride, I certainly could. But instead, I\u2019d like to share a few tips\non how to properly install drywall. Now you put the drywall up\n\u2026\u201c\u00a0\u2018VOICE-OVER: Sometimes it\u2019s just not\nfair to delay an important decision.\u201c\u00a0\u2018But in Washington it\u2019s happening. A\ngroup of Senators is using the filibuster delay tactic to block\nfederal judicial nominees from a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d vote. So\nqualified candidates don\u2019t get a chance to serve.\u201c\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s politics at work, causing\ngridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of\nemergency.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl and\ntell them to oppose the filibuster.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Visit: BeFair.org\u201c\u00a0\u2018Paid for by Wisconsin Right to Life\n(befair.org), which is responsible for the content of this\nadvertising and not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s\ncommittee.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 195, 198, n.\u00a03 (DC\n2006).On the same day, WRTL aired a similar radio ad\nentitled \u201cLoan.\u201d[Footnote 2] It\nhad also invested treasury funds in producing a television ad\nentitled \u201cWaiting,\u201d[Footnote 3]\nwhich is similar in substance and format to \u201cWedding\u201d and\n\u201cLoan.\u201dWRTL planned on running \u201cWedding,\u201d \u201cWaiting,\u201d\nand \u201cLoan\u201d throughout August 2004 and financing the ads with funds\nfrom its general treasury. It recognized, however, that as of\nAugust 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be\nillegal \u201celectioneering communication[s]\u201d under BCRA \u00a7203.Believing that it nonetheless possessed a\nFirst Amendment right to broadcast these ads, WRTL filed suit\nagainst the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on July 28, 2004,\nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief before a three-judge\nDistrict Court. See note following 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7437h (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV); 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72284. WRTL alleged that BCRA\u2019s\nprohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for\n\u201celectioneering communication[s]\u201d as defined in the Act is\nunconstitutional as applied to \u201cWedding,\u201d \u201cLoan,\u201d and \u201cWaiting,\u201d as\nwell as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the\nfuture.Just before the BCRA blackout period was to\nbegin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction,\nconcluding that \u201cthe reasoning of theMcConnellCourt\nleaves no room for the kind of \u2018as applied\u2019 challenge WRTL\npropounds before us.\u201d App. to Juris. Statement 52a. In response to\nthis ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.\nThe District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL\u2019s complaint. Seeid.,at 47a\u201348a (\u201cWRTL\u2019s \u2018as-applied\u2019 challenge to BCRA\n[\u00a7203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision inMcConnell\u201d). On appeal, we vacated the District Court\u2019s\njudgment, holding thatMcConnell\u201cdid not purport to\nresolve future as-applied challenges\u201d to BCRA \u00a7203, and remanded\n\u201cfor the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL\u2019s as-applied\nchallenge in the first instance.\u201dWRTL I, 546 U. S., at\n412.On remand, after allowing four Members of\nCongress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court\ngranted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA \u00a7203\nunconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL\nplanned to run during the 2004 blackout period. The District Court\nfirst found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness\nbecause the controversy was \u201c\u00a0\u2018capable of repetition, yet\nevading review.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 202. Turning to\nthe merits, the court began by noting that underMcConnell, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe \u201cexpress\nadvocacy\u201d\u2014defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or\ndefeat of a candidate for federal office\u2014and the \u201cfunctional\nequivalent\u201d of such advocacy. 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 204. Stating\nthat it was limiting its inquiry to \u201clanguage within the four\ncorners\u201d of the ads,id.,at 207, the District Court\nconcluded that the ads werenotexpress advocacy or its\nfunctional equivalent, but instead \u201cgenuine issue ads.\u201dId.,at 205\u2013208. Then, reaching a question \u201cleft open inMcConnell,\u201d the court held that no compelling interest\njustified BCRA\u2019s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL\nsought to run.Id.,at 208\u2013210.One judge dissented, contending that the\nmajority\u2019s \u201cplain facial analysis of the text in WRTL\u2019s 2004\nadvertisements\u201d ignored \u201cthe context in which the text was\ndeveloped.\u201dId.,at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.). In that\njudge\u2019s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed \u201cdeep\nfactual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and\nintended effects of the ads\u201d such that neither side was entitled to\nsummary judgment.Id.,at 210, 211.The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices\nof appeal and jurisdictional statements. We consolidated the two\nappeals and set the matter for briefing and argument, postponing\nfurther consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.\n549 U. S. ___ (2007).IIArticle III\u2019s\n\u201ccase-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of\nfederal judicial proceedings . . . . [I]t is not enough that a\ndispute was very much alive when suit was filed.\u201dLewisv.Continental Bank Corp.,494 U. S. 472, 477\n(1990). Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the\nintervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004\nelection has passed and WRTL \u201cdoes not assert any continuing\ninterest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it\nidentify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over\nSenate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the\nforeseeable future.\u201d Brief for Appellant FEC 21.As the District Court concluded,\nhowever, these cases fit comfortably within the established\nexception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet\nevading review. SeeLos Angelesv.Lyons,461 U. S. 95, 109\n(1983);Southern Pacific Terminal Co.v.ICC,219 U. S. 498,\n515 (1911). The exception applies where \u201c(1) the challenged action\nis in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to\ncessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation\nthat the same complaining party will be subject to the same action\nagain.\u201dSpencerv.Kemna,523 U. S. 1, 17 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Both circumstances\nare present here.As the District Court found, it would be\n\u201centirely unreasonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have\nobtained complete judicial review of its claims in time for it to\nair its ads\u201d during the BCRA blackout periods. 466 F.\u00a0Supp.\n2d, at 202. The FEC contends that the 2-year window between\nelections provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights\nbefore each BCRA blackout period. But groups like WRTL cannot\npredict what issues will be matters of public concern during a\nfuture blackout period. In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing\nwell in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial\nfilibusters during the BCRA blackout period. In any event, despite\nBCRA\u2019s command that the cases be expedited \u201cto the greatest\npossible extent,\u201d \u00a7403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7437h (2000 ed., Supp. IV),twoBCRA blackout\nperiods have come and gone during the pendency of this action. \u201c[A]\ndecision allowing the desired expenditures would be an empty\ngesture unless it afforded appellants sufficient opportunity prior\nto the election date to communicate their views effectively.\u201dFirst Nat. Bank of Bostonv.Bellotti,435 U. S. 765, 774\n(1978).The second prong of the \u201ccapable of\nrepetition\u201d exception requires a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable\nexpectation\u2019\u00a0\u201d or a \u201c\u00a0\u2018demonstrated probability\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nthat \u201cthe same controversy will recur involving the same\ncomplaining party.\u201dMurphyv.Hunt,455 U. S. 478, 482\n(1982) (per curiam). Our cases find the same controversy\nsufficiently likely to recur when a party has a reasonable\nexpectation that it \u201cwill again be subjected to the alleged\nillegality,\u201dLyons,supra,at 109, or \u201cwill be\nsubject to the threat of prosecution\u201d under the challenged law,Bellotti,supra,at 774\u2013775 (citingWeinsteinv.Bradford,423 U. S. 147, 149\n(1975) (per curiam)). The FEC argues that in order to\nprove likely recurrence of the same controversy, WRTL must\nestablish that it will run ads in the future sharing all \u201cthe\ncharacteristics that the district court deemed legally relevant.\u201d\nBrief for Appellant FEC 23.The FEC asks for too much. We have recognized\nthat the \u201c\u00a0\u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019\ndoctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when\nthere are \u2018as applied\u2019 challenges as well as in the more typical\ncase involving only facial attacks.\u201dStorerv.Brown,415\nU. S. 724, 737, n.\u00a08 (1974). Requiring repetition of every\n\u201clegally relevant\u201d characteristic of an as-applied challenge\u2014down\nto the last detail\u2014would effectively overrule this statement by\nmaking this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied\nchallenges. History repeats itself, but not at the level of\nspecificity demanded by the FEC. Here, WRTL credibly claimed that\nit planned on running \u201c\u00a0\u2018materially similar\u2019\u00a0\u201d future\ntargeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout\nperiod, 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to\nbelieve that the FEC will \u201crefrain from prosecuting violations\u201d of\nBCRA,Bellotti,supra,at 775. Under the\ncircumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary\ninjunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006\nblackout period, see 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 203, n.\u00a015, we\nhold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same\ncontroversy involving the same party will recur. We have\njurisdiction to decide these cases.IIIWRTL rightly concedes that its\nads are prohibited by BCRA \u00a7203. Each ad clearly identifies Senator\nFeingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic\nprimary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been\n\u201ctargeted to the relevant electorate,\u201d see 2 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7434(f)(3)(C) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout\nperiod. WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of\nBCRA\u2019s exceptions to the term \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d See\n\u00a7434(f)(3)(B). The only question, then, is whether it is consistent\nwith the First Amendment for BCRA \u00a7203 to prohibit WRTL from\nrunning these three ads.AAppellants contend that WRTL\nshould be required to demonstrate that BCRA is unconstitutional as\napplied to the ads. Reply Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain\net\u00a0al. in No. 06\u2013970, p.\u00a05, n.\u00a04; Brief for\nAppellant FEC 34. After all, appellants reason,McConnellalready held that BCRA \u00a7203 was facially valid. These cases,\nhowever, present the separate question whether \u00a7203 may\nconstitutionally be applied to these specific ads. Because BCRA\n\u00a7203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.\nSeeMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 205;Austinv.Michigan Chamber of Commerce,494 U. S. 652, 658 (1990);MCFL, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion);Bellotti,supra,at 786;Buckley, 424 U.\nS., at 44\u201345. Under strict scrutiny, theGovernmentmust\nprove that applying BCRA to WRTL\u2019s ads furthers a compelling\ninterest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. SeeBellotti,supra,at 786 (\u201cEspecially where, as\nhere, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is\nintimately related to the process of governing, \u2026 \u2018the burden is on\nthe government to show the existence of [a compelling]\ninterest\u2019\u00a0\u201d (footnote omitted)).The strict scrutiny analysis is,\nof course, informed by our precedents. This Court has already ruled\nthat BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates\nexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.McConnell,supra,at 206. So to the extent the ads in these cases fit\nthis description, the FEC\u2019s burden is not onerous; all it need do\nis point toMcConnelland explain why it applies here. If,\non the other hand, WRTL\u2019s ads arenotexpress advocacy or\nits equivalent, the Government\u2019s task is more formidable. It must\nthen demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods\nis narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. No precedent\nof this Court has yet reached that conclusion.BThe FEC, intervenors, and the\ndissent below contend thatMcConnellalready established\nthe constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to\ninfluence elections and has that effect. See,e.g.,466\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.). Here is the\nrelevant portion of our opinion inMcConnell:\u201c[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that\nadequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply\nto significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition\nof electioneering communications.\u201cThis argument fails to the extent that the\nissue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding\nfederal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent\nof express advocacy. The justifications for the regulation of\nexpress advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if\nthe ads are intended to influence the voters\u2019 decisions and have\nthat effect.\u201d 540 U. S., at 205\u2013206.WRTL and the District Court\nmajority, on the other hand, claim thatMcConnelldid not\nadopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges. We\nagree.McConnell\u2019s analysis was grounded in the\nevidentiary record before the Court. Two key studies in theMcConnellrecord constituted \u201cthe central piece of\nevidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA\u2019s electioneering\ncommunication provisions in support of their constitutional\nvalidity.\u201dMcConnellv.FEC, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d\n176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal\nquotation marks and brackets omitted). Those studies asked \u201cstudent\ncoders\u201d to separate ads based on whether the students thought the\n\u201cpurpose\u201d of the ad was \u201cto provide information about or urge\naction on a bill or issue,\u201d or \u201cto generate support or opposition\nfor a particular candidate.\u201dId.,at 308\u2013309 (internal\nquotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee\n38. The studies concluded \u201c\u00a0\u2018that BCRA\u2019s definition of\nElectioneering Communications accurately captures those ads thathave the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for\nelection to office.\u201dIbid.(emphasis in\noriginal).When theMcConnellCourt considered\nthe possible facial overbreadth of \u00a7203, it looked to the studies\nin the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods,\nand those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and\neffect. The Court\u2019s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same\nterms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the\nrecord before it, that the plaintiffs had not \u201ccarried their heavy\nburden of proving\u201d that \u00a7203 was facially overbroad and could not\nbe enforced inanycircumstances. 540 U. S., at 207. The\nCourt did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for\ndetermining what constituted the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express\nadvocacy. The fact that the student coders who helped develop the\nevidentiary record before the Court inMcConnelllooked to\nintent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the\nrecord on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim,\nneither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the\nconstitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge,\npolitical speech protected under the First Amendment from that\nwhich may be banned.[Footnote\n4]More importantly, this Court inBuckleyhad already rejected an intent-and-effect test for\ndistinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates. See\n424 U. S., at 43\u201344. After noting the difficulty of distinguishing\nbetween discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of\nelection or defeat of candidates on the other, theBuckleyCourt explained that analyzing the question in terms \u201c\u00a0\u2018of\nintent and of effect\u2019\u00a0\u201d would afford \u201c\u00a0\u2018no security for\nfree discussion.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 43 (quotingThomasv.Collins,323 U. S. 516, 535\n(1945)). It therefore rejected such an approach, andMcConnelldid not purport to overruleBuckleyon\nthis point\u2014or even address whatBuckleyhad to say on the\nsubject.For the reasons regarded as sufficient inBuckley, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied\nchallenges turning on the speaker\u2019s intent to affect an election.\nThe test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech\nfrom speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor\nfor those who wish to exercise First Amendment rights. The test\nshould also \u201creflec[t] our \u2018profound national commitment to the\nprinciple that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,\nrobust, and wide-open.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBuckley,supra,at\n14 (quotingNew York Times Co.v.Sullivan,376 U. S. 254,\n270 (1964)). A test turning on the intent of the speaker does not\nremotely fit the bill.Far from serving the values the First\nAmendment is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill\ncore political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad\nwithin the terms of \u00a7203, on the theory that the speaker actually\nintended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the\nindications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy\nissue. No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by\nBCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that\nits motives were pure. An intent-based standard \u201cblankets with\nuncertainty whatever may be said,\u201d and \u201coffers no security for free\ndiscussion.\u201dBuckley,supra,at 43 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The FEC does not disagree. In its brief\nfiled in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a\n\u201cconstitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of\na speaker\u2019s message would likely be incapable of workable\napplication; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent\nlitigation.\u201d Brief for Appellee inWRTL I, O.\u00a0T.\n2005, No. 04\u20131581, p. 39.[Footnote\n5]A test focused on the speaker\u2019s intent could\nlead to the bizarre result that identical ads aired at the same\ntime could be protected speech for one speaker, while leading to\ncriminal penalties for another. See M. Redish, Money Talks: Speech,\nEconomic Power, and the Values of Democracy 91 (2001) (\u201c[U]nder\nwell-accepted First Amendment doctrine, a speaker\u2019s motivation is\nentirely irrelevant to the question of constitutional protection\u201d).\n\u201cFirst Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\u201dNAACPv.Button,371 U. S. 415, 433\n(1963). An intent test provides none.Buckleyalso explains the flaws of a\ntest based on the actual effect speech will have on an election or\non a particular segment of the target audience. Such a test\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018puts the speaker \u2026 wholly at the mercy of the varied\nunderstanding of his hearers.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 424 U. S., at 43. It would\nalso typically lead to a burdensome, expert-driven inquiry, with an\nindeterminate result. Litigation on such a standard may or may not\naccurately predict electoral effects, but it will unquestionably\nchill a substantial amount of political speech.C\u201cThe freedom of speech \u2026\nguaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to\ndiscuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern\nwithout previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.\u201dBellotti, 435 U. S., at 776 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). SeeConsolidated Edison Co. of N.\u00a0Y.v.Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N.\u00a0Y.,447 U. S. 530, 534\n(1980). To safeguard this liberty, the proper standard for an\nas-applied challenge to BCRA \u00a7203 must be objective, focusing on\nthe substance of the communication rather than amorphous\nconsiderations of intent and effect. SeeBuckley,supra,at 43\u201344. It must entail minimal if any discovery,\nto allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling\nspeech through the threat of burdensome litigation. SeeVirginiav.Hicks,539 U. S. 113, 119\n(2003). And it must eschew \u201cthe open-ended rough-and-tumble of\nfactors,\u201d which \u201cinvit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a\nvirtually inevitable appeal.\u201dJerome B. Grubart, Inc.v.Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.,513 U. S. 527, 547\n(1995). In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to\nprotecting rather than stifling speech. SeeNew York Times\nCo.v.Sullivan,supra,at 269\u2013270.In light of these considerations, a court\nshould find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a\nspecific candidate. Under this test, WRTL\u2019s three ads are plainly\nnot the functional equivalent of express advocacy. First, their\ncontent is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads\nfocus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort\nthe public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact\npublic officials with respect to the matter. Second, their content\nlacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an\nelection, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do\nnot take a position on a candidate\u2019s character, qualifications, or\nfitness for office.Despite these characteristics, appellants\nassert that the content of WRTL\u2019s ads alone betrays their\nelectioneering nature. Indeed, the FEC suggests thatanyad covered by \u00a7203 that includes \u201can appeal to citizens to contact\ntheir elected representative\u201d is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of an\nad saying defeat or elect that candidate. Brief for Appellant FEC\n31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et\u00a0al.in No. 06\u2013970, pp.\u00a021\u201323 (hereinafter McCain Brief). We do not\nagree. To take just one example, during a blackout period the House\nconsidered the proposed Universal National Service Act. See App. to\nBrief for American Center for Law and Justice et\u00a0al.asAmicus CuriaeB\u20133. There would be no reason to regard\nan ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to\ncontact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad\nsaying vote for or against the Representative. Issue advocacy\nconveys information and educates. An issue ad\u2019s impact on an\nelection, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear\nthe information and choose\u2014uninvited by the ad\u2014to factor it into\ntheir voting decisions.[Footnote\n6]The FEC and intervenors try to turn this\ndifference to their advantage, citingMcConnell\u2019s\nstatements \u201cthat the most effective campaign ads, like the most\neffective commercials for products . . . avoid the\n[Buckley] magic words [expressly advocating the election\nor defeat of a candidate],\u201d 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers\n\u201cwould seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,\u201did.,at 193. See McCain Brief 19. An expert for the FEC in\nthese cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL\u2019s ads\nare especially effective electioneering ads because they are\n\u201csubtl[e],\u201d focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the\nelectorate to vote against Senator Feingold. App. 56\u201357. Rephrased\na bit, the argument perversely maintains that thelessan\nissue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be\nthe functional equivalent of express advocacy. This \u201cheads I win,\ntails you lose\u201d approach cannot be correct. It would effectively\neliminate First Amendment protection for genuine issue ads,\ncontrary to our conclusion inWRTL Ithat as-applied\nchallenges to \u00a7203 are available, and our assumption inMcConnellthat \u201cthe interests that justify the regulation\nof campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine\nissue ads,\u201d 540 U. S., at 206, n.\u00a088. Under appellants\u2019 view,\nthere can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the\nblackout period\u2014it is simply a very effective electioneering\nad.Looking beyond the content of WRTL\u2019s ads, the\nFEC and intervenors argue that several \u201ccontextual\u201d factors prove\nthat the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy. First,\nappellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL\nand its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator\nFeingold\u2019s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign\nissue. This evidence goes to WRTL\u2019s subjective intent in running\nthe ads, and we have already explained that WRTL\u2019s intent is\nirrelevant in an as-applied challenge. Evidence of this sort is\ntherefore beside the point, as it should be\u2014WRTL does not forfeit\nits right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its\nwork it also opposes candidates who are involved with those\nissues.Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the\ntiming of WRTL\u2019s ads. They observe that the ads were to be aired\nnear elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial\nnominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections. To\nthe extent this evidence goes to WRTL\u2019s subjective intent, it is\nagain irrelevant. To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the\nads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short. That\nthe ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a\nchallenge like this.Everyad covered by BCRA \u00a7203 will by\ndefinition air just before a primary or general election. If this\nwere enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of\nexpress advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its\napplications. This Court unanimously rejected this contention inWRTL I.That the ads were run shortly after the Senate\nhad recessed is likewise unpersuasive. Members of Congress often\nreturn to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the\nviews of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in\ngetting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or\nshe is back home. In any event, a group can certainly choose to run\nan issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor\nvote. Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA\nblackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.\nBrief for Appellee 16. The focus of the Senate was on whether a\nmajority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the\nfilibuster\u2014not whether individual Senators would continue\nfilibustering. Given this change, WRTL\u2019s decision not to continue\nrunning its ads after the blackout period does not support an\ninference that the ads were the functional equivalent of\nelectioneering.The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC\nand intervenors highlight is the ads\u2019 \u201cspecific and repeated\ncross-reference\u201d to a website. Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15. In\nthe middle of the website\u2019s homepage, in large type, were the\naddresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of\nSenators Feingold and Kohl. Wisconsinites who viewed \u201cWedding,\u201d\n\u201cLoan,\u201d or \u201cWaiting\u201d and wished to contact their Senators\u2014as the\nads requested\u2014would be able to obtain the pertinent contact\ninformation immediately upon visiting the website. This is fully\nconsistent with viewing WRTL\u2019s ads as genuine issue ads. The\nwebsite also stated both Wisconsin Senators\u2019 positions on judicial\nfilibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for \u201ce-alerts,\u201d some\nof which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.\nThese details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads\nmore credence, but again, WRTL\u2019s participation in express advocacy\nin other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring\nits issue-related speech. Any express advocacy on the website,\nalready one step removed from the text of the ads themselves,\ncertainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine\nissue ads unreasonable.Given the standard we have adopted for\ndetermining whether an ad is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express\nadvocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants\nshould seldom play a significant role in the inquiry. Courts need\nnot ignore basic background information that may be necessary to\nput an ad in context\u2014such as whether an ad \u201cdescribes a legislative\nissue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny\nor likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,\u201d\n466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 207\u2014but the need to consider such\nbackground should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader\ninquiry of the sort we have just noted raises First Amendment\nconcerns.At best, appellants have shown what we have\nacknowledged at least sinceBuckley: that \u201cthe distinction\nbetween discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of\nelection or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical\napplication.\u201d 424 U. S., at 42. Under the test set forth above,\nthat is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be\nviewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.\n\u201cFreedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function\nin this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is\nneeded or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with\nthe exigencies of their period.\u201dThornhillv.Alabama,310\nU. S. 88, 102 (1940). Discussion of issues cannot be suppressed\nsimply because the issues may also be pertinent in an election.\nWhere the First Amendment is implicated, the tie goes to the\nspeaker, not the censor.[Footnote\n7]We confronted a similar issue inAshcroftv.Free Speech Coalition,535 U. S. 234(2002), in\nwhich the Government argued that virtual images of child\npornography were difficult to distinguish from real images. The\nGovernment\u2019s solution was \u201cto prohibit both kinds of images.\u201dId.,at 254\u2013255. We rejected the argument that \u201cprotected\nspeech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech,\u201d\nconcluding that it \u201cturns the First Amendment upside down.\u201dId.,at 255. As we explained: \u201cThe Government may not\nsuppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.\nProtected speech does not become unprotected merely because it\nresembles the latter. The Constitution requires the reverse.\u201dIbid.Because WRTL\u2019s ads may reasonably be\ninterpreted as something other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a specific candidate, we hold they are not the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy, and therefore fall outside the\nscope ofMcConnell\u2019s holding.[Footnote 8]IVBCRA \u00a7203 can be constitutionally\napplied to WRTL\u2019s ads only if it is narrowly tailored to further a\ncompelling interest.McConnell, 540 U. S.,at\n205;Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 786;Buckley,supra,at 44\u201345. This Court has never recognized a\ncompelling interest in regulating ads, like WRTL\u2019s, that are\nneither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent. The\nDistrict Court below considered interests that might justify\nregulating WRTL\u2019s ads here, and found none sufficiently compelling.\n466 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 208\u2013210. We reach the same\nconclusion.[Footnote 9]At the outset, we reject the\ncontention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express\nelection advocacy may be, and \u201cthe speech involved in so-called\nissue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are\nwords of express advocacy.\u201dMcConnell,supra,at\n205. This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict\nscrutiny works. A corporate ad expressing support for the local\nfootball team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech\nis less \u201ccore\u201d than corporate speech about an election, which we\nhave held may be restricted. A court applying strict scrutiny must\nensure that a compelling interest supportseach\napplicationof a statute restricting speech. That a compelling\ninterest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little\nabout whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue\nadvocacy; theMcConnellCourt itself made just that point.\nSee 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88. Such a greater-includes-the-lesser\nargument would dictate that virtuallyallcorporate speech\ncan be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being\nas central to the First Amendment as campaign speech. That\nconclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent. See,e.g.,Bellotti,supra,at 776\u2013777.This Court has long recognized \u201cthe\ngovernmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance\nof corruption\u201d in election campaigns.Buckley, 424 U. S.,\nat 45. This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholdingcontributionlimits. AsBuckleyexplained, \u201c[t]o\nthe extent that large contributions are given to secure a politicalquid pro quofrom current and potential office holders,\nthe integrity of our system of representative democracy is\nundermined.\u201dId.,at 26\u201327. We have suggested that this\ninterest might also justify limits on electioneeringexpendituresbecause it may be that, in some\ncircumstances, \u201clarge independent expenditures pose the same\ndangers of actual or apparentquid pro quoarrangements as\ndo large contributions.\u201dId.,at 45.McConnellarguably applied this\ninterest\u2014which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation\nof express advocacy\u2014to ads that were the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of\nexpress advocacy. See 540 U. S., at 204\u2013206. But to justify\nregulation of WRTL\u2019s ads, this interest must be stretched yet\nanother step to ads that arenotthe functional equivalent\nof express advocacy. Enough is enough. Issue ads like WRTL\u2019s are by\nno means equivalent to contributions, and thequid-pro-quocorruption interest cannot justify regulating them. To equate\nWRTL\u2019s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political\nspeech.Appellants argue that an expansive definition\nof \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d is needed to ensure that issue advocacy\ndoes not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in\nturn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against\ncontributions. Cf.McConnell, supra,at 205 (\u201c[R]ecent\ncases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate\nelectoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of\n[valid] contribution limits\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted;\nbrackets in original)). But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis\napproach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict\nscrutiny. \u201c[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly\nconstitutes thecompellingstate interest necessary to\njustify any infringement on First Amendment freedom.\u201dMCFL, 479 U. S., at 263. SeeFree Speech\nCoalition, 535 U. S., at 255 (\u201cThe Government may not suppress\nlawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech\u201d);Buckley,supra,at 44 (expenditure limitations\n\u201ccannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing\nthe effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution\nlimitations\u201d).A second possible compelling interest\nrecognized by this Court lies in addressing a \u201cdifferent type of\ncorruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting\neffects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with\nthe help of the corporate form and that have little or no\ncorrelation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political\nideas.\u201dAustin, 494 U. S., at 660.Austininvoked\nthis interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for\ncorporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on\nexpress election advocacy.Id.,at 654\u2013655.McConnellalso relied on this interest in upholding\nregulation not just of express advocacy, but also its \u201cfunctional\nequivalent.\u201d 540 U. S., at 205\u2013206.These cases did not suggest, however, that the\ninterest in combating \u201ca different type of corruption\u201d extended\nbeyond campaign speech. Quite the contrary. Two of the Justices who\njoined the 6-to-3 majority inAustinrelied, in upholding\nthe constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact\nthat corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct\nfrom election campaigns. See 494 U. S., at 675\u2013678 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban \u201cdoes not\nregulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate\nexpression\u201d as \u201creflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions\u201d);id.,at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]here is a vast\ndifference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one\nhand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the\nother\u201d). TheMcConnellCourt similarly was willing to\n\u201cassume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign\nspeech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.\u201d 540\nU. S., at 206, n. 88. And our decision inWRTL Ireinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA\n\u00a7203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges. 546 U. S., at\n411\u2013412.Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign\nspeech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question\nour holding inBellottithat the corporate identity of a\nspeaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights. 435\nU. S., at 778. It would be a constitutional \u201cbait and switch\u201d to\nconclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in partbecausecorporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert\nthat corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to\nthe same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception\nof what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech,\nor by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from\nissue advocacy.The FEC and intervenors do not argue that theAustininterest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.\nInstead, they focus on establishing that WRTL\u2019s ads are the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy\u2014a contention we have\nalready rejected. We hold that the interest recognized inAustinas justifying regulation of corporate campaign\nspeech and extended inMcConnellto the functional\nequivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of\nthe sort engaged in by WRTL.[Footnote 10]Because WRTL\u2019s ads are not express advocacy or\nits functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no\ninterest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL\u2019s\nspeech, we hold that BCRA \u00a7203 is unconstitutional as applied to\nWRTL\u2019s \u201cWedding,\u201d \u201cLoan,\u201d and \u201cWaiting\u201d ads.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*These cases are about political\nspeech. The importance of the cases to speech and debate on public\npolicy issues is reflected in the number of diverse organizations\nthat have joined in supporting WRTL before this Court: the American\nCivil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association, the American\nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the\nChamber of Commerce of the United States of America, Focus on the\nFamily, the Coalition of Public Charities, the Cato Institute, and\nmany others.Yet, as is often the case in this\nCourt\u2019s First Amendment opinions, we have gotten this far in the\nanalysis without quoting the Amendment itself: \u201cCongress shall make\nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d The Framers\u2019 actual\nwords put these cases in proper perspective. Our jurisprudence over\nthe past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of\nthose words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the\narea of pure political speech\u2014between what is protected and what\nthe Government may ban\u2014it is worth recalling the language we are\napplying.McConnellheld that express advocacy of a\ncandidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an\nelection may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of\nsuch express advocacy. We have no occasion to revisit that\ndetermination today. But when it comes to defining what speech\nqualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject\nto such a ban\u2014the issue wedohave to decide\u2014we give the\nbenefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship. The First\nAmendment\u2019s command that \u201cCongress shall make no law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech\u201d demands at least that.The judgment of the United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia is affirmed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Subparagraph (A) provides:\u201c(i)\u2002The term \u2018electioneering communication\u2019\nmeans any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which\u2014\u201c(I)\u2002refers to a clearly identified candidate\nfor Federal office;\u201c(II)\u2002is made within\u2014\u201c(aa)\u200260 days before a general, special, or\nrunoff election for the office sought by the candidate; or\u201c(bb)\u200230 days before a primary or preference\nelection, or a convention or caucus of a political party that has\nauthority to nominate a candidate, for the office sought by the\ncandidate; and\u201c(III)\u2002in the case of a communication which\nrefers to a candidate for an office other than President or Vice\nPresident, is targeted to the relevant electorate.\u201d 2 U.

(stating that the\nstudies were flawed and of limited evidentiary value), withid.,at 585, 583\u2013588 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.)\n(finding the studies generally credible, but stating that \u201cI am\ntroubled by the fact that coders in both studies were asked\nquestions regarding their own perceptions of the advertisements\u2019\npurposes, and that [some of] these perceptions were later recoded\u201d\nby study supervisors). Nothing in this Court\u2019s opinion inMcConnellsuggests it was resolving the sharp\ndisagreements about the evidentiary record in this respect.Footnote 5Consider what happened in these cases. The\nDistrict Court permitted extensive discovery on the assumption that\nWRTL\u2019s intent was relevant. As a result, the defendants deposed\nWRTL\u2019s executive director, its legislative director, its political\naction committee director, its lead communications consultant, and\none of its fundraisers. WRTL also had to turn over many documents\nrelated to its operations, plans, and finances. Such litigation\nconstitutes a severe burden on political speech.Footnote 6For these reasons, we cannot agree with\nJustice Souter\u2019s assertion that \u201canyone who heard the Feingold ads\n\u2026 would know that WRTL\u2019s message was to vote against Feingold.\u201dPost,at 23. The dissent supports this assertion by\nlikening WRTL\u2019s ads to the \u201cJane Doe\u201d example identified inMcConnellv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,540 U. S. 93(2003). But that ad\n\u201ccondemned Jane Doe\u2019s record on a particular issue.\u201dPost,at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted). WRTL\u2019s ads do not do so;\nthey instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort\nconstituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that\nposition. Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether\nSenator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters. Justice Souter\nis confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold\u2019s\nposition on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced. A\nprominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election\ncycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to\nname at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in\ntheir own district. See Inter-university Consortium for Political\nand Social Research, American National Election Study, 2000: Pre-\nand Post-Election Survey 243 (N. Burns et\u00a0al. eds. 2002)\nonline at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/ cocoon/ICPSR/STUDY/03131.xml\n(as visited June 22, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).Footnote 7Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly\nvague. Seepost, at 11\u201312 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). As should be evident, we agree with\nJustice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is\nwhy our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible ofno reasonable interpretationother than as an appeal to\nvote for or against a specific candidate. It is why we emphasize\nthat (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2)\nthere generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of\n\u201ccontextual\u201d factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3)\ndiscussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues\nmight be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the\ntie is resolved in favor of protecting speech. And keep in mind\nthis test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline\nrequirements of BCRA \u00a7203 in the first place. Justice Scalia\u2019s\ncriticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts\nWRTL\u2019s proposed three-prong test as \u201cclear.\u201dPost,at 17.\nWe do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL\u2019s, and it is more\nprotective of political speech.Justice Scalia also asserts that our test\nconflicts withBuckleyv.Valeo,424 U. S. 1(1976) (per\ncuriam). Post,at 13\u201316. TheBuckleyCourt\nconfronted a statute restricting \u201cany expenditure \u2026 relative to a\nclearly identified candidate.\u201d 424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first\nnarrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly\n\u201cadvocating the election or defeat of a candidate\u201d\u2014using the\nso-called \u201cmagic words\u201d of express advocacy.Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court then proceeded to\nstrike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the\nground that its reach was not broad enough.Id., at 44.\nFrom this, Justice Scalia concludes that \u201c[i]f a permissible test\nshort of the magic-words test existed,Buckleywould\nsurely have adopted it.\u201dPost, at 14. We are not so sure.\nThe question inBuckleywas how a particular statutory\nprovision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what\nthe constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract,\ndivorced from specific statutory language.Buckley\u2019s\nintermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its\nconstitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test. TheBuckleyCourt\u2019s \u201cexpress advocacy restriction was an\nendpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of\nconstitutional law.\u201dMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 190. And\ndespite Justice Scalia\u2019s claim to the contrary, our citation ofBuckleyalong with other decisions in rejecting an\nintent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject)Buckley\u2019s statutory construction as a constitutional\ntest.Footnote 8Nothing inMcConnell\u2019s statement\nthat the \u201cvast majority\u201d of issue ads broadcast in the periods\npreceding federal elections had an \u201celectioneering purpose\u201d\nforecloses this conclusion. 540 U. S., at 206. Courts do not\nresolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of\nresolving a facial attack, soMcConnellcould not have\nsettled the issue we address today. SeeMembers of City Council\nof Los Angelesv.Taxpayers for Vincent,466 U. S. 789, 803, n.\n22 (1984) (\u201cThe fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications\ndoes not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these\nlitigants\u201d). Indeed,WRTL Iconfirmed as much. 546 U. S.,\nat 411\u2013412. By the same token, in deciding this as-applied\nchallenge, we have no occasion to revisitMcConnell\u2019s\nconclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.The \u201cvast majority\u201d language, moreover, is beside the point. TheMcConnellCourt did not find that a \u201cvast majority\u201d of the\nissue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct\nadvocacy. Rather, it found that such ads had an \u201celectioneering\npurpose.\u201d For the reasons we have explained, \u201cpurpose\u201d is not the\nappropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and\nthe functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy. Seesupra, at 14\u201315. In addition, the \u201cvast majority\u201d\nstatement was not necessary to the Court\u2019s facial holding inMcConnell. The standard required for a statute to survive\nan overbreadth challenge is not that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of a\nstatute\u2019s applications be legitimate. \u201c[B]road language . . .\nunnecessary to the Court\u2019s decision \u2026 cannot be considered binding\nauthority.\u201dKastigarv.United States,406 U. S. 441, 454\u2013455\n(1972).Footnote 9The dissent stresses a number of points that,\nwhile not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.\nFirst, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the\n\u201cPAC alternative\u201d gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient\noutlet to speak. Seepost,at 30. PACs impose\nwell-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small\nnonprofits. SeeMCFL,479 U. S. 238, 253\u2013255 (1986)\n(plurality opinion).McConnelldid conclude that\nsegregated funds \u201cprovid[e] corporations and unions with a\nconstitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express\nadvocacy\u201d and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but\nthat holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents\u2014and if it\ndid, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate\nspeech, a proposition we have rejected, seeBellotti, 435\nU. S., at 777\u2013778. Second, the response that a speaker should just\ntake out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain\nthat it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, seepost,at 18\u201319, 33, is too glib. Even assuming for the\nsake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium\nof communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of\na limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not\nreasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and\neffectiveness. SeeMcConnellv.FEC, 251\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 569\u2013573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.). Third, we\ndisagree with the dissent\u2019s view that corporations can still speak\nby changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates,post,at 30\u201331. That argument is akin to telling Cohen\nthat he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that\nsays \u201cI disagree with the draft,\u201d cf.Cohenv.California,403 U. S. 15(1971), or\ntelling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids\nmentioning prices, cf.44 Liquormart, Inc.v.Rhode\nIsland,517 U.\nS. 484(1996). Such notions run afoul of \u201cthe fundamental rule\nof protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the\nautonomy to choose the content of his own message.\u201dHurleyv.Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\nInc.,515 U. S.\n557, 573 (1995).Footnote 10The interest recognized inAustinstems from a concern that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he resources in the treasury\nof a business corporation . . . are not an indication of popular\nsupport for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAustinv.Michigan Chamber of Commerce,494 U. S. 652, 659 (1990) (alteration\nin original). Some of WRTL\u2019samicicontend that this\ninterest is not implicated here because of WRTL\u2019s status as a\nnonprofit advocacy organization. They assert that \u201c[s]peech by\nnonprofit advocacy groups on behalf of their members does not\n\u2018corrupt\u2019 candidates or \u2018distort\u2019 the political marketplace,\u201d and\nthat \u201c[n]onprofit advocacy groups funded by individuals are readily\ndistinguished from for-profit corporations funded by general\ntreasuries.\u201d Brief for Family Research Council et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae3, 4. Cf.MCFL,479 U. S., at 264.\nWe do not pass on this argument in this as-applied challenge\nbecause WRTL\u2019s funds for its ads were not derived solely from\nindividual contributions.
