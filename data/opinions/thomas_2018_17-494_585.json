Twenty-five years later, we\nhad the opportunity to overruleBellas HessinQuill\nCorp.v.North Dakota, 504 U.\u00a0S. 298 (1992). Only\nJustice White voted to do so. Seeid., at 322 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). I should have joined\nhis opinion. Today, I am slightly further removed fromQuillthan Justice White was fromBellas Hess. And like Justice\nWhite, a quarter century of experience has convinced me thatBellas HessandQuill\u201ccan no longer be rationally\njustified.\u201d 504 U.\u00a0S., at 333. The same is true for this\nCourt\u2019s entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. SeeComptroller of Treasury of Md.v.Wynne, 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at\n1). Although I adhered to that jurisprudence inQuill, it is\nnever too late to \u201csurrende[r] former views to a better considered\nposition.\u201dMcGrathv.Kristensen, 340 U.\u00a0S. 162,\n178 (1950) (Jackson, J., concurring). I therefore join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.",
