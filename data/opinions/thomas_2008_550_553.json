S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1456HUMBERTO FIDEL REGALADO CUELLAR, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[June 2, 2008]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case involves the provision\nof the federal money laundering statute that prohibits\ninternational transportation of the proceeds of unlawful activity.\nPetitioner argues that his conviction cannot stand because, while\nthe evidence demonstrates that he took steps to hide illicit fundsen routeto Mexico, it does not show that the cross-border\ntransport of those funds was designed to create the appearance of\nlegitimate wealth. Although we agree with the Government that the\nstatute does not require proof that the defendant attempted to\n\u201clegitimize\u201d tainted funds, we agree with petitioner that the\nGovernment must demonstrate that the defendant did more than merely\nhide the money during its transport. We therefore reverse the\njudgment of the Fifth Circuit.IOn July 14, 2004, petitioner\nHumberto Fidel Regalado Cuellar was stopped in southern Texas for\ndriving errati-cally. Driving south toward the Mexican border,\nabout 114 miles away, petitioner had just passed the town of\nEldorado. In response to the officer\u2019s questions, petitioner, who\nspoke no English, handed the officer a stack of papers. Included\nwere bus tickets showing travel from a Texas border town to San\nAntonio on July 13 and, in the other direction, from San Antonio to\nBig Spring, Texas, on July 14. A Spanish-speaking officer, Trooper\nDanny Nu&nacute;ez, was called to the scene and began\nquestioning petitioner. Trooper Nu&nacute;ez soon became\nsuspicious because petitioner was avoiding eye contact and seemed\nvery nervous. Petitioner claimed to be on a 3-day business trip,\nbut he had no luggage or extra clothing with him, and he gave\nconflicting accounts of his itinerary. When Trooper\nNu&nacute;ez asked petitioner about a bulge in his shirt\npocket, petitioner produced a wad of cash that smelled of\nmarijuana.Petitioner consented to a search\nof the Volkswagen Beetle that he was driving. While the officers\nwere searching the vehicle, Trooper Nu&nacute;ez observed\npetitioner standing on the side of the road making the sign of the\ncross, which he interpreted to mean that petitioner knew he was in\ntrouble. A drug detection dog alerted on the cash from petitioner\u2019s\nshirt pocket and on the rear area of the car. Further scrutiny\nuncovered a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, and\ninside the compartment the officers found approximately $81,000 in\ncash. The money was bundled in plastic bags and duct tape, and\nanimal hair was spread in the rear of the vehicle. Petitioner\nclaimed that he had previously transported goats in the vehicle,\nbut Trooper Nu&nacute;ez doubted that goats could fit in such a\nsmall space and suspected that the hair had been spread in an\nattempt to mask the smell of marijuana.There were signs that the compartment had been\nrecently created and that someone had attempted to cover up the\nbodywork: The Beetle\u2019s carpeting appeared newer than the rest of\nthe interior, and the exterior of the vehicle appeared to have been\npurposely splashed with mud to cover up toolmarks, fresh paint, or\nother work. In the backseat, officers found a fast-food restaurant\nreceipt dated the same day from a city farther north than\npetitioner claimed to have traveled. After a check of petitioner\u2019s\nlast border crossing also proved inconsistent with his story,\npetitioner was arrested and interrogated. He continued to tell\nconflicting stories about his travels. At one point, before he knew\nthat the officers had found the cash, he remarked to Trooper\nNu&nacute;ez that he had to have the car in Mexico by midnight\nor else his family would be \u201cfloating down the river.\u201d App. 50.Petitioner was charged with attempting to\ntransport the proceeds of unlawful activity across the border,\nknowing that the transportation was designed \u201cto conceal or\ndisguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or\nthe control\u201d of the money. 18 U. S. C. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). After a\n2-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty. The District Court\ndenied petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal based on\ninsufficient evidence and sentenced petitioner to 78 months in\nprison, followed by three years of supervised release.On appeal, a divided panel of the Fifth\nCircuit reversed and rendered a judgment of acquittal. 441\nF.\u00a03d 329 (2006). Judge Smith\u2019s majority opinion held that,\nalthough the evidence showed that petitioner concealed the money\nfor the purpose of transporting it, the statute requires that the\npurpose of the transportation itself must be to conceal or disguise\nthe unlawful proceeds.Id.,at 333\u2013334. Analogizing from\ncases interpreting another provision of the money laundering\nstatute, the court held that the transportation must be undertaken\nin an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate\nwealth.[Footnote 1] Seeid.,at 334. Although the evidence showed intent to avoid\ndetection while driving the funds to Mexico, it did not show that\npetitioner intended to create the appearance of legitimate wealth,\nand accordingly no rational trier of fact could have found\npetitioner guilty.Ibid. Judge Davis dissented, arguing\nthat concealment during transportation is sufficient to violate\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).Id.,at 334\u2013336.The Fifth Circuit granted rehearing en banc\nand affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction. 478 F.\u00a03d 282 (2007).\nThe court rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text\npetitioner\u2019s argument that the Government must prove that he\nattempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.Id.,at 290. But it held that petitioner\u2019s extensive\nefforts to prevent detection of the funds during transportation\nshowed that petitioner sought to conceal or disguise the nature,\nlocation, and source, ownership, or control of the funds.Id.,at 289\u2013290. Judge Smith dissented for largely the\nsame reasons set forth in his opinion for the original panel\nmajority. He emphasized the distinction between \u201cconcealing\nsomething to transport it, and transporting something to conceal\nit,\u201d and explained that whether petitioner was doing the latter\ndepended on whether his ultimate plan upon reaching his destination\nwas to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, or control\nof the money.Id.,at 296\u2013297.We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___\n(2007).IIThe federal money laundering\nstatute, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71956, prohibits specified transfers of\nmoney derived from unlawful activities. Subsection (a)(1) makes it\nunlawful to engage in certain financial transactions, while\nsubsection (a)(2) criminalizes certain kinds of transportation.\nPetitioner was charged under the transportation provision: The\nindictment alleged that he attempted to transport illicit proceeds\nacross the Mexican border \u201cknowing that such transportation was\ndesigned in whole or in part to conceal and disguise the nature,\nlocation, source, ownership, and control\u201d of the funds.[Footnote 2] App. 10\u201311 (citing\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i)).AWe first consider the \u201cdesigned \u2026\nto conceal\u201d element. Petitioner argues that to satisfy this\nelement, the Government must prove that the defendant attempted to\ncreate the appearance of legitimate wealth. Petitioner would\nreplace \u201cdesigned \u2026 to conceal or disguise the nature, the\nlocation, the source, the ownership, or the control of the\nproceeds\u201d with \u201cdesigned to create the appearance of legitimate\nwealth.\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). This is consistent with the plain\nmeaning of \u201cmoney laundering,\u201d petitioner argues, because that term\nis commonly understood to mean disguising illegally obtained money\nin order to make it appear legitimate. In petitioner\u2019s view, this\ncommon understanding of \u201cmoney laundering\u201d is implicit in both the\ntransaction and transportation provisions of the statute because\nconcealing or disguising any of the listed attributes would\nnecessarily have the effect of making the funds appear legitimate,\nand, conversely, revealing any such attribute would necessarily\nreveal the funds as illicit. The Government disagrees, contending\nthat making funds appear legitimate is merely one way to accomplish\nmoney laundering, and that revealing a listed attribute would not\nnecessarily reveal the funds\u2019 illicit nature. In any event, the\nGovernment argues, the statute should not be cabined to target only\nclassic money laundering because Congress intended to reach any\nconduct that impairs the ability of law enforcement to find and\nrecover the unlawful proceeds.We agree with petitioner that\ntaking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning\nof the term \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d See American Heritage Dictionary\n992 (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter Am. Hert.) (defining \u201claunder\u201d as\n\u201c[t]o disguise the source or nature of (illegal funds, for example)\nby channeling through an intermediate agent\u201d); Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1027 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining\n\u201cmoney-laundering\u201d to mean \u201c[t]he act of transferring illegally\nobtained money through legitimate people or accounts so that its\noriginal source cannot be traced\u201d). But to the extent they are\ninconsistent, we must be guided by the words of the operative\nstatutory provision, and not by the common meaning of the statute\u2019s\ntitle. SeePennsylvania Dept. of Correctionsv.Yeskey,524\nU. S. 206, 212 (1998) (declining to use a statute\u2019s title to\nlimit the meaning of the text). Here, Congress used broad language\nthat captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to\nconcealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds,\nCongress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or\ndisguise the location, ownership, or control of the funds. For\nexample, a defendant who smuggles cash into Mexico with the intent\nof hiding it from authorities by burying it in the desert may have\nengaged in transportation designed to conceal the location of those\nfunds, but his conduct would not necessarily have the effect of\nmaking the funds appear legitimate.Nor do we find persuasive petitioner\u2019s attempt\nto infuse a \u201cclassic money laundering\u201d requirement into the listed\nattributes. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, revealing those\nattributes\u2014nature, location, source, ownership, or control\u2014would\nnot necessarily expose the illegitimacy of the funds. Digging up\nthe cash buried in the Mexican desert, for example, would not\nnecessarily reveal that it was derived from unlawful activity.\nIndeed, of all the listed attributes, only \u201cnature\u201d is coextensive\nwith the funds\u2019 illegitimate character: Exposing the nature of\nillicit funds would, by definition, reveal them as unlawful\nproceeds. But nature is only one attribute in the statute; that it\nmay be coextensive with the creation of the appearance of\nlegitimate wealth does not mean that Congress intended that\nrequirement to swallow the other listed attributes.We likewise are skeptical of petitioner\u2019s\nargument that violating the elements of the statute would\nnecessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more\nlegitimate than they did before. It is true that concealing or\ndisguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of\nmaking the funds appear more legitimate\u2014largely because concealing\nor disguising those attributes might impede law enforcement\u2019s\nability to identify illegitimate funds\u2014but we are not convinced\nthat this is necessarily so. It might be possible for a defendant\nto conceal or disguise a listed attribute without also creating the\nappearance of legitimate wealth. Cf.United Statesv.Abbell, 271 F.\u00a03d 1286, 1298 (CA11 2001) (noting that\nthe transaction provision, although designed to punish those who\n\u201cattemp[t] to legitimize their proceeds,\u201d may be satisfied without\nproof that a particular defendant did so). Petitioner\u2019s \u201cappearance\nof legitimate wealth\u201d requirement simply has no basis in the\noperative provision\u2019s text.Petitioner argues that the money laundering\ntransportation provision must be aimed at something other than\nmerely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that\nconduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a75332 (2000 ed., Supp. V). We disagree. A comparison\nof the statutory language reveals that, even if no \u201cappearance of\nlegitimate wealth\u201d requirement exists in 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), the two statutes nonetheless target distinct\nconduct. The bulk cash smuggling provision encompasses, in relevant\npart, a defendant who,\u201cwith the intent to evade a currency reporting\nrequirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than\n$10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments . . . and\ntransports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such\ncurrency or monetary instruments from a place within the United\nStates to a place outside of the United States.\u201d 31 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75332(a)(1).To be sure, certain conduct may fall within both\nstatutes. For example, both provisions may be violated by a\ndefendant who intends to evade a relevant reporting requirement.\nSee \u00a75332(a)(1) (transportation of funds \u201cwith the intent to evade\na currency reporting requirement\u201d); 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(ii) (transportation of funds knowing that it is\ndesigned \u201cto avoid a transaction reporting requirement\u201d). But only\nthe money laundering statute may be violated in the absence of such\nintent. See \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) (prohibiting transportation of\nillicit funds knowing that the transportation is designed to\nconceal or disguise a listed attribute). Similarly, although both\nstatutes encompass transportation of illicit funds, only the bulk\ncash smuggling statute also punishes the mere transportation of\nlawfully derived proceeds.[Footnote\n3] Compare 31 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a75332(a) (omitting any requirement\nthat the funds be unlawfully derived) with 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B) (requiring that the defendant \u201ckno[w] that the\nmonetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation \u2026\nrepresent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\u201d).BHaving concluded that the statute\ncontains no \u201cappearance of legitimate wealth\u201d requirement, we next\nconsider whether the evidence that petitioner concealed the money\nduring transportation is sufficient to sustain his conviction. As\nnoted, petitioner was convicted under \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in\nrelevant part, makes it a crime to attempt to transport \u201cfunds from\na place in the United States to \u2026 a place outside the United States\n\u2026 knowing that the \u2026 funds involved in the transportation \u2026\nrepresent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and\nknowing that such transportation \u2026 is designed in whole or in part\n\u2026 to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the\nownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful\nactivity.\u201d Accordingly, the Government was required in this case to\nprove that petitioner (1)\u00a0attempted to transport funds from\nthe United States to Mexico, (2)\u00a0knew that these funds\n\u201crepresent[ed] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\u201de.g.,drug trafficking, and (3)\u00a0knew that \u201csuch\ntransportation\u201d was designed to \u201cconceal or disguise the nature,\nthe location, the source, the ownership, or the control\u201d of the\nfunds.It is the last of these that is at issue\nbefore us, viz., whether petitioner knew that \u201csuch transportation\u201d\nwas designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the\nillegally obtained funds. In this connection, it is important to\nkeep in mind that the critical transportation was not the\ntransportation of the funds within this country on the way to the\nborder. Instead, the term \u201csuch transportation\u201d means\ntransportation \u201cfrom a place in the United States to \u2026 a place\noutside the United States\u201d\u2014here, from the United States to Mexico.\nTherefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner\nknew that taking the funds to Mexico was \u201cdesigned,\u201d at least in\npart, to conceal or disguise their \u201cnature,\u201d \u201clocation,\u201d \u201csource,\u201d\n\u201cownership,\u201d or \u201ccontrol.\u201dPetitioner argues that the evidence is not\nsufficient to sustain his conviction because concealing or\ndisguising a listed attribute of the funds during transportation\ncannot satisfy the \u201cdesigned \u2026 to conceal\u201d element. Citing cases\nthat interpret the identical phrase in the transaction provision to\nexclude \u201cmere spending,\u201d[Footnote\n4] petitioner argues that the transportation provision must\nexclude \u201cmere hiding.\u201d Otherwise, petitioner contends, all\ncross-border transport of illicit funds would fall under the\nstatute because people regularly make minimal efforts to conceal\nmoney, such as placing it inside a wallet or other receptacle, in\norder to secure it during travel. The Government responds that\nconcealment during transportation is sufficient to satisfy this\nelement because it is circumstantial evidence that the ultimate\npurpose of the transportation\u2014i.e., its \u201cdesign\u201d\u2014is to\nconceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds. This standard\nwould not criminalize all cross-border transport of illicit funds,\nthe Government argues, because, just as in the transaction\ncases,[Footnote 5] the statute\nencompasses onlysubstantialefforts at concealment. As a\nresult, the Government agrees with the Court of Appeals that a\nviolation of the transportation provision cannot be established\nsolely by evidence that the defendant carried money in a wallet or\nconcealed it in some other conventional or incidental way. See 478\nF.\u00a03d, at 291 (characterizing the defendant\u2019s transportation\nof money in a box inUnited Statesv.Dimeck,24\nF.\u00a03d 1239, 1246 (CA10 1994), as a \u201cminimal attempt at\nconcealment\u201d that is distinguishable from petitioner\u2019s \u201ceffort to\nhide or conceal\u201d the funds).We agree with petitioner that\nmerely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to\nviolate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended\nto conceal the money. Our conclusion turns on the text of\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), and particularly on the term \u201cdesign.\u201d In this\ncontext, \u201cdesign\u201d means purpose or plan;i.e., the\nintended aim of the transportation. See Am. Hert. 491 (\u201cTo\nformulate a plan for; devise\u201d; \u201c[t]o create or contrive for a\nparticular purpose or effect\u201d); Black\u2019s 478 (\u201cA plan or scheme\u201d;\n\u201c[p]urpose or intention combined with a plan\u201d); see also Brief for\nUnited States 14 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018to conceive and plan out in the\nmind\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n611 (1993)). Congress wrote \u201cknowing that such transportation is\ndesigned \u2026 to conceal or disguise\u201d a listed attribute of the funds,\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i), and when an act is \u201cdesigned to\u201d do something,\nthe most natural reading is that it has that something as its\npurpose. The Fifth Circuit employed this meaning of design when it\nreferred to the \u201ctransportation design or plan to get the funds out\nof this country.\u201d See 478 F. 3d, at 289.But the Fifth Circuit went on to discuss the\n\u201cdesign\u201d of the transportation in a different sense. It described\nthe packaging of the money, its placement in the hidden\ncompartment, and the use of animal hair to mask its scent as\n\u201caspectsof the transportation\u201d that \u201cwere designed to\nconceal or disguise\u201d the nature and location of the cash.Ibid. (emphasis added). Because the Fifth Circuit used\n\u201cdesign\u201d to refer not to the purpose of the transportation but to\nthe manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this\ncontext was consistent with the alternate meaning of \u201cdesign\u201d as\nstructure or arrangement. See Am. Hert. 491, 492 (\u201cTo plan out in\nsystematic, usually graphic form\u201d; \u201c[t]he purposeful or inventive\narrangement of parts or details\u201d); Black\u2019s 478 (\u201cThe pattern or\nconfiguration of elements in something, such as a work of art\u201d).\nThe Government at times also appears to adopt this meaning of\n\u201cdesign.\u201d See Brief for United States 21 (\u201cCongress focused on how\nthe transportation itself was \u2018designed\u2019\u00a0\u201d);id., at\n43 (arguing that petitioner\u2019s design to move funds without\ndetection is proof of a design to conceal or disguise the location\nand nature of the funds).[Footnote\n6] If the statutory term had this meaning, it would apply\nwhenever a person transported illicit funds in a secretive manner.\nJudge Smith supplied an example of this construction: A petty thief\nwho hides money in his shoe and then walks across the border to\nspend the money in local bars, see 478 F. 3d, at 301 (dissenting\nopinion), has engaged in transportation designed to conceal the\nlocation of the money because he has hidden it in an unlikely\nplace.We think it implausible, however, that\nCongress intended this meaning of \u201cdesign.\u201d If it had, it could\nhave expressed its intention simply by writing \u201cknowing that such\ntransportation conceals or disguises,\u201d rather than the more complex\nformulation \u201cknowing that such transportation \u2026 is designed \u2026 to\nconceal or disguise.\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i). It seems far more likely\nthat Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law\nconcepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a\ndefendant \u201cstructured\u201d the transportation. In addition, the\nstructural meaning of \u201cdesign\u201d is both overinclusive and\nunderinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured\ntransportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent\n(such as a person who hid illicit fundsen routeto turn\nthem over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who\nfully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by\nlaw enforcement but failed to hide them during the\ntransportation.To be sure, purpose and structure are often\nrelated. One may employ structure to achieve a purpose: For\nexample, the petty thief may hide money in his shoe to prevent it\nfrom being detected as he crosses the border with the intent to\nhide the money in Mexico. See 478 F. 3d, at 301 (Smith, J.,\ndissenting). Although transporting money in a conventional manner\nmay suggest no particular purpose other than simply to move it from\none place to another, secretively transporting it suggests, at\nleast, that the defendant did not want the money to be detected\nduring transport. In this case, evidence of the methods petitioner\nused to transport the nearly $81,000 in cash\u2014bundled in plastic\nbags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal\nhair\u2014was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the\nfunds from being detected while he drove them from the United\nStates to Mexico. The same secretive aspects of the transportation\nalso may be circumstantial evidence that the transportation itself\nwas intended to avoid detection of the funds, because, for example,\nthey may suggest that the transportation is only one step in a\nlarger plan to facilitate the cross-border transport of the funds.\nCf.id., at 289 (noting that \u201cconcealment of the funds\nduring the U. S. leg of the trip [was] a vital part of the\ntransportation design or plan to get the funds out of this\ncountry\u201d). But its probative force, in that context, is weak.\n\u201cThere is a difference between concealing something to transport\nit, and transporting something to conceal it,\u201did., at\n296\u2013297 (Smith, J., dissenting); that is,howone moves\nthe money is distinct fromwhyone moves the money.\nEvidence of the former, standing alone, is not sufficient to prove\nthe latter.This case illustrates why: Even with abundant\nevidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to\ntransport it, the Government\u2019s own expert witness\u2014ICE Agent Richard\nNuckles\u2014testified that the purpose of the transportation was to\ncompensate the leaders of the operation.[Footnote 7] Tr. 179 (Oct. 12, 2004), App. 64\u201365 (\u201c[T]he\nbulk of [the money] generally goes back to Mexico, because the\nsmuggler is the one who originated this entire process. He\u2019s going\nto get a large cut of the profit, and that money has to be moved\nback to him in Mexico\u201d). The evidence suggested that the secretive\naspects of the transportation were employed tofacilitatethe transportation, see 478 F.\u00a03d, at 289 (noting that\n\u201cconcealment of the funds during the U. S. leg of the trip [was] a\nvital part of the transportation design or plan\u201d), but not\nnecessarily that secrecy was thepurposeof the\ntransportation. Agent Nuckles testified that the secretive manner\nof transportation was consistent with drug smuggling, see Tr.\n179\u2013180, App. 65\u201366, but the Government failed to introduce any\nevidence that the reason drug smugglers move money to Mexico is to\nconceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.Agent Nuckles also testified that\nAcuna, the Mexican border town to which petitioner was headed, has\na cash economy and that U. S. currency is widely accepted there.\nSee Tr. 188\u2013189, App. 69. The Fifth Circuit apparently viewed this\nas evidence that petitioner transported the money in order to\nconceal or disguise it: \u201c[G]iven Mexico\u2019s largely cash economy, if\n[petitioner] had successfully transported the funds to Mexico\nwithout detection, the jury was entitled to find that the funds\nwould have been better concealed or concealable after the\ntransportation than before.\u201d 478 F.\u00a03d, at 292. The statutory\ntext makes clear, however, that a conviction under this provision\nrequires proof that the purpose\u2014not merely effect\u2014of the\ntransportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute.\nAlthough the evidence suggested that petitioner\u2019s transportation\nwould have had the effect of concealing the funds, the evidence did\nnot demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the\ntransportation because, for instance, there was no evidence that\npetitioner knew about or intended the effect.[Footnote 8]In sum, we conclude that the\nevidence introduced by the Government was not sufficient to permit\na reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\npetitioner\u2019s transportation was \u201cdesigned in whole or in part \u2026 to\nconceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the\nownership, or the control of the proceeds.\u201d \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).IIIThe provision of the money\nlaundering statute under which petitioner was convicted requires\nproof that the transportation was \u201cdesigned in whole or in part to\nconceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the\nownership, or the control\u201d of the funds. \u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i).\nAlthough this element does not require proof that the defendant\nattempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither\ncan it be satisfied solely by evidence that a defendant concealed\nthe funds during their transport. In this case, the only evidence\nintroduced to prove this element showed that petitioner engaged in\nextensive efforts to conceal the fundsen routeto Mexico,\nand thus his conviction cannot stand. We reverse the judgment of\nthe Fifth Circuit.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Several Courts of Appeals\nhave considered this requirement as relevant, or even necessary, in\nthe context of 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71956(a)(1)(B)(i), which prohibits,inter alia, engaging in financial transactions\n\u201cinvolv[ing] the proceeds of specified unlawful activity . . .\nknowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part . . .\nto conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the\nownership, or the control of the proceeds of some specified\nunlawful activity.\u201d SeeUnited Statesv.Morales-Rodriguez, 467 F.\u00a03d 1, 13 (CA1 2006);United Statesv.Esterman, 324 F.\u00a03d 565,\n572\u2013573 (CA7 2003);United Statesv.Abbell, 271\nF.\u00a03d 1286, 1298 (CA11 2001);United Statesv.McGahee, 257 F.\u00a03d 520, 527\u2013528 (CA6 2001);UnitedStatesv.Dobbs, 63 F.\u00a03d\n391, 397 (CA5 1995);United Statesv.Dimeck, 24\nF.\u00a03d 1239, 1247 (CA10 1994).In construing the provision under which\npetitioner was convicted, four Courts of Appeals, including the\nFifth Circuit, have implicitly or explicitly rejected the\nrequirement. SeeUnited Statesv.Garcia-Jaimes,\n484 F.\u00a03d 1311, 1322 (CA11 2007) (upholding convictions for\nconspiracy to commit transportation money laundering without\naddressing the requirement);United Statesv.Ness, 466 F.\u00a03d 79, 81\u201382 (CA2 2006) (rejecting the\nrequirement and upholding a conviction for conspiracy to violate\nthe transportation provision where defendant\u2019s conduct was\nelaborate and highly secretive);United Statesv.Carr, 25 F.\u00a03d 1194, 1206\u20131207 (CA3 1994) (upholding\na conviction under the transportation provision without discussing\nthe requirement).Footnote 2Subsection (a)(2) reads, in\nits entirety:\u201cWhoever transports, transmits, or transfers, or attempts to\ntransport, transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds\nfrom a place in the United States to or through a place outside the\nUnited States or to a place in the United States from or through a\nplace outside the United States\u2014\u201c(A) with the intent to promote the carrying\non of specified unlawful activity; or\u201c(B) knowing that the monetary instrument or\nfunds involved in the transportation, transmission, or transfer\nrepresent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and\nknowing that such transportation, transmission, or transfer is\ndesigned in whole or in part\u2014\u201c(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the\nlocation, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\nof specified unlawful activity; or\u201c(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting\nrequirement under State or Federal law,\u201cshall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice\nthe value of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the\ntransportation, transmission, or transfer whichever is greater, or\nimprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both. For the\npurpose of the offense described in subparagraph (B), the\ndefendant\u2019s knowledge may be established by proof that a law\nenforcement officer represented the matter specified in\nsubparagraph (B) as true, and the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements\nor actions indicate that the defendant believed such\nrepresentations to be true.\u201dFootnote 3Section 1956(a)(2)(A) also\npunishes the mere transportation of lawfully derived proceeds, but\nit imposes the additional requirement, not found in 31 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a75332 (2000 ed., Supp. V), that the defendant must have\n\u201cinten[ded] to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\nactivity.\u201dFootnote 4See,e.g.,\nEsterman, 324 F.\u00a03d, at 570\u2013572;United Statesv.Corchado-Peralta, 318 F.\u00a03d 255, 259 (CA1 2003);McGahee, 257 F.\u00a03d, at 527;United Statesv.Herron, 97 F.\u00a03d 234, 237 (CA8 1996);United\nStatesv.Majors, 196 F.\u00a03d 1206, 1213 (CA11\n1999);United Statesv.Stephenson, 183\nF.\u00a03d 110, 120\u2013121 (CA2 1999);Dobbs, 63 F.\u00a03d,\nat 398;United Statesv.Garcia-Emanuel, 14\nF.\u00a03d 1469, 1474 (CA10 1994).Footnote 5See,e.g.,Ness, 466 F.\u00a03d, at 81 (concluding that extensive\nattempts at secrecy were sufficient to support a conviction under\n18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71956(a)(1), but \u201cexpress[ing] no view\u201d as to\nwhether transactions involving \u201cless elaborate stratagems or a\nlesser measure of secrecy\u201d would be sufficient);United\nStatesv.Johnson, 440 F.\u00a03d 1286, 1291 (CA11\n2006) (\u201cEvidence of concealment must be substantial\u201d);Dimeck, 24 F.\u00a03d, at 1247 (\u201cThe transportation of the\nmoney from Detroit to California in a box, suitcase, or other\ncontainer does not convert the mere transportation of money into\nmoney laundering\u201d).Footnote 6This understanding of\n\u201cdesign\u201d is also implicit in some of the Government\u2019s statements\nthat secretive transportation is sufficient to prove a violation of\nthe statute. See Brief for United States 46 (arguing that the\nstatute covers any \u201csurreptitiou[s]\u201d movement of funds \u201cto a\nlocation where United\u00a0States law enforcement authorities are\nimpaired from detecting and intercepting them,\u201d apparently\nregardless of whether such impairment was the purpose of the plan);id., at 11 (\u201cWhen a defendant surreptitiously transports\nor attempts to transport illegal proceeds across the border knowing\nof their illegal character, money laundering is the appropriate\ncharge\u201d);id., at 13 (\u201cThe statute explicitly covers, and\nwas intended to cover, a wide range of conduct that impairs the\nability of law enforcement to find and recover the proceeds of\ncrime\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Agent Richard Nuckles, Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement (ICE), appears to have adopted this\nstandard at trial as well. See Tr. 196 (Oct. 12, 2004) (testifying\nthat attempting to move funds across the border without detection\nwould be illegal, apparently regardless of the reason for doing\nso).Footnote 7Concealing or disguising a listed attribute\nneed be only one of the purposes of the transportation. See\n\u00a71956(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that a transportation plan need be\ndesigned \u201cin whole or in part\u201d to conceal or disguise). But here,\ncompensating the leaders of the operation was the only purpose to\nwhich Agent Nuckles testified.Footnote 8In many cases, a criminal defendant\u2019s\nknowledge or purpose is not established by direct evidence but\ninstead is shown circumstantially based on inferences drawn from\nevidence of effect. See,e.g., 1 W. LaFave, Substantive\nCriminal Law \u00a75.2(a), p. 341 (2d ed. 2003). Specifically, where the\nconsequences of an action are commonly known, a trier of fact will\noften infer that the person taking the action knew what the\nconsequences would be and acted with the purpose of bringing them\nabout. Although, as noted above, the Government introduced some\nevidence regarding the effect of transporting illegally obtained\nmoney to Mexico, the Government has not pointed to any evidence in\nthe record from which it could be inferred beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico would\nhave had one of the relevant effects.",
