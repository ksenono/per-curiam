HARRIS FUNERAL HOMES,\nINC., PETITIONER18\u2013107v.EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY\nCOMMISSION, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[June 15, 2020]Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,\ndissenting.There is only one word for what the Court has\ndone today: legislation. The document that the Court releases is in\nthe form of a judicial opinion interpreting a statute, but that is\ndeceptive.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nprohibits employment discrimination on any of five specified\ngrounds: \u201crace, color, religion, sex, [and] national origin.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). Neither \u201csexual orientation\u201d nor\n\u201cgender identity\u201d appears on that list. For the past 45 years,\nbills have been introduced in Congress to add \u201csexual orientation\u201d\nto the list,[1] and in recent\nyears, bills have included \u201cgender identity\u201d as well.[2] But to date, none has passed both\nHouses.Last year, the House of Representatives passed a\nbill that would amend Title VII by defining sex discrimination to\ninclude both \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity,\u201d H.\u00a0R.\n5, 116th Cong., 1st Sess. (2019), but the bill has stalled in the\nSenate. An alternative bill, H.\u00a0R. 5331, 116th Cong., 1st\nSess. (2019), would add similar prohibitions but contains\nprovisions to protect religious liberty.[3] This bill remains before a House Subcommittee.Because no such amendment of Title VII has been\nenacted in accordance with the requirements in the Constitution\n(passage in both Houses and presentment to the President, Art. I,\n\u00a77, cl. 2), Title VII\u2019s prohibition of discrimination because of\n\u201csex\u201d still means what it has always meant. But the Court is not\ndeterred by these constitutional niceties. Usurping the\nconstitutional authority of the other branches, the Court has\nessentially taken H.\u00a0R. 5\u2019s provision on employment\ndiscrimination and issued it under the guise of statutory\ninterpretation.[4] A more\nbrazen abuse of our authority to interpret statutes is hard to\nrecall.The Court tries to convince readers that it is\nmerely enforcing the terms of the statute, but that is\npreposterous. Even as understood today, the concept of\ndiscrimination because of \u201csex\u201d is different from discrimination\nbecause of \u201csexual orientation\u201d or \u201cgender identity.\u201d And in any\nevent, our duty is to interpret statutory terms to \u201cmean what they\nconveyed to reasonable peopleat the time they were\nwritten.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 16 (2012) (emphasis added). If every\nsingle living American had been surveyed in 1964, it would have\nbeen hard to find any who thought that discrimination because of\nsex meant discrimination because of sexual orientation\u2013\u2013not to\nmention gender identity, a concept that was essentially unknown at\nthe time.The Court attempts to pass off its decision as\nthe inevitable product of the textualist school of statutory\ninterpretation championed by our late colleague Justice Scalia, but\nno one should be fooled. The Court\u2019s opinion is like a pirate ship.\nIt sails under a textualist flag, but what it actually represents\nis a theory of statutory interpretation that Justice Scalia\nexcoriated\u2013\u2013the theory that courts should \u201cupdate\u201d old statutes so\nthat they better reflect the current values of society. See A.\nScalia, A Matter of Interpretation 22(1997). If the Court finds it appropriate to\nadopt this theory, it should own up to what it is doing.[5]Many will applaud today\u2019s decision because they\nagree on policy grounds with the Court\u2019s updating of Title VII. But\nthe question in these cases is not whether discrimination because\nof sexual orientation or gender identityshould beoutlawed.\nThe question iswhether Congress did that in 1964.It indisputably did not.IATitle VII, as noted, prohibits discrimination\n\u201cbecause of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sex,\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), and in 1964, it\nwas as clear as clear could be that this meant discrimination\nbecause of the genetic and anatomical characteristics that men and\nwomen have at the time of birth. Determined searching has not found\na single dictionary from that time that defined \u201csex\u201d to mean\nsexual orientation, gender identity, or \u201ctransgender\nstatus.\u201d[6]Ante, at 2.\n(Appendix A,infra, to this opinion includes the full\ndefinitions of \u201csex\u201d in the unabridged dictionaries in use in the\n1960s.)In all those dictionaries, the primary\ndefinition of \u201csex\u201d was essentially the same as that in the\nthen-most recent edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n2296 (def. 1) (2d ed. 1953): \u201c[o]ne of the two divisions of\norganisms formed on the distinction of male and female.\u201d See also\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1187 (def. 1(a)) (1969) (\u201cThe property\nor quality by which organisms are classified according to their\nreproductive functions\u201d); Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1307 (def. 1) (1966) (Random House Dictionary) (\u201cthe fact\nor character of being either male or female\u201d); 9 Oxford English\nDictionary 577 (def. 1) (1933) (\u201cEither of the two divisions of\norganic beings distinguished as male and female respectively\u201d).The Court does not dispute that this is what\n\u201csex\u201d means in Title VII, although it coyly suggests that there is\nat least some support for a different and potentially relevant\ndefinition.Ante, at 5. (I address alternative definitions\nbelow. See Part I\u2013B\u20133,infra.) But the Court declines to\nstand on that ground and instead \u201cproceed[s] on the assumption that\n\u2018sex\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. refer[s] only to biological distinctions\nbetween male and female.\u201dAnte, at 5.If that is so, it should be perfectly clear that\nTitle VII does not reach discrimination because of sexual\norientation or gender identity. If \u201csex\u201d in Title VII means\nbiologically male or female, then discrimination because of sex\nmeans discrimination because the person in question is biologically\nmale or biologically female, not because that person is sexually\nattracted to members of the same sex or identifies as a member of a\nparticular gender.How then does the Court claim to avoid that\nconclusion? The Court tries to cloud the issue by spending many\npages discussing matters that are beside the point. The Court\nobserves that a Title VII plaintiff need not show that \u201csex\u201d was\nthe sole or primary motive for a challenged employment decision or\nits sole or primary cause; that Title VII is limited to\ndiscrimination with respect to a list of specified actions (such as\nhiring, firing, etc.); and that Title VII protects individual\nrights, not group rights. Seeante, at 5\u20139, 11.All that is true, but so what? In cases like\nthose before us, a plaintiff must show that sex was a \u201cmotivating\nfactor\u201d in the challenged employment action, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u20132(m), so the question we must decide comes down to this: if\nan individual employee or applicant for employment shows that his\nor her sexual orientation or gender identity was a \u201cmotivating\nfactor\u201d in a hiring or discharge decision, for example, is that\nenough to establish that the employer discriminated \u201cbecause of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. sex\u201d? Or, to put the same question in different\nterms, if an employer takes an employment action solely because of\nthe sexual orientation or gender identity of an employee or\napplicant, has that employer necessarily discriminated because of\nbiological sex?The answers to those questions must be no,\nunless discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity inherently constitutes discrimination because of sex. The\nCourt attempts to prove that point, and it argues, not merely that\nthe terms of Title VIIcanbe interpreted that way but that\ntheycannot reasonably be interpreted any other way.\nAccording to the Court, the text is unambiguous. Seeante,\nat 24, 27, 30.The arrogance of this argument is breathtaking.\nAs I will show, there is not a shred of evidence that any Member of\nCongress interpreted the statutory text that way when Title VII was\nenacted. See Part III\u2013B,infra. But the Court apparently\nthinks that this was because the Members were not \u201csmart enough to\nrealize\u201d what its language means.Hivelyv.Ivy Tech\nCommunity College of Ind., 853 F.3d 339, 357 (CA7 2017)\n(Posner, J., concurring). The Court seemingly has the same opinion\nabout our colleagues on the Courts of Appeals, because until 2017,\nevery single Court of Appeals to consider the question interpreted\nTitle VII\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination to mean\ndiscrimination on the basis of biological sex. See Part III\u2013C,infra. And for good measure, the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nTitle VII unambiguously reaches discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation and gender identity necessarily means that the\nEEOC failed to see the obvious for the first 48 years after Title\nVII became law.[7] Day in and\nday out, the Commission enforced Title VII but did not grasp what\ndiscrimination \u201cbecause of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sex\u201d unambiguously\nmeans. See Part III\u2013C,infra.The Court\u2019s argument is not only arrogant, it is\nwrong. It fails on its own terms. \u201cSex,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d and\n\u201cgender identity\u201d are different concepts, as the Court concedes.Ante, at 19 (\u201chomosexuality and transgender status are\ndistinct concepts from sex\u201d). And neither \u201csexual orientation\u201d nor\n\u201cgender identity\u201d is tied to either of the two biological sexes.\nSeeante, at 10 (recognizing that \u201cdiscrimination on these\nbases\u201d does not have \u201csome disparate impact on one sex or\nanother\u201d). Both men and women may be attracted to members of the\nopposite sex, members of the same sex, or members of both\nsexes.[8] And individuals who\nare born with the genes and organs of either biological sex may\nidentify with a different gender.[9]Using slightly different terms, the Court\nasserts again and again that discrimination because of sexual\norientation or gender identity inherently or necessarily entails\ndiscrimination because of sex. Seeante, at 2 (When an\nemployer \u201cfires an individual for being homosexual or transgender,\u201d\n\u201c[s]ex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision\u201d);ante, at 9 (\u201c[I]t is impossible to discriminate against a\nperson for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating\nagainst that individual based on sex\u201d);ante, at 11 (\u201c[W]hen\nan employer discriminates against homosexual or transgender\nemployees, [the] employer .\u00a0.\u00a0. inescapablyintendsto rely on sex in its decisionmaking\u201d);ante,\nat 12 (\u201cFor an employer to discriminate against employees for being\nhomosexual or transgender, the employer must intentionally\ndiscriminate against individual men and women in part because of\nsex\u201d);ante, at 14 (\u201cWhen an employer fires an employee for\nbeing homosexual or transgender, it necessarily and intentionally\ndiscriminates against that individual in part because of sex\u201d);ante, at 19 (\u201c[D]iscrimination based on homosexuality or\ntransgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on\nsex\u201d). But repetition of an assertion does not make it so, and the\nCourt\u2019s repeated assertion is demonstrably untrue.Contrary to the Court\u2019s contention,\ndiscrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity\ndoes not in and of itself entail discrimination because of sex. We\ncan see this because it is quite possible for an employer to\ndiscriminate on those grounds without taking the sex of an\nindividual applicant or employee into account. An employer can have\na policy that says: \u201cWe do not hire gays, lesbians, or transgender\nindividuals.\u201d And an employer can implement this policy without\npaying any attention to or even knowing the biological sex of gay,\nlesbian, and transgender applicants. In fact, at the time of the\nenactment of Title VII, the United States military had a blanket\npolicy of refusing to enlist gays or lesbians, and under this\npolicy for years thereafter, applicants for enlistment were\nrequired to complete a form that asked whether they were\n\u201chomosexual.\u201d Appendix D,infra, at 88, 101.At oral argument, the attorney representing the\nemployees, a prominent professor of constitutional law, was asked\nif there would be discrimination because of sex if an employer with\na blanket policy against hiring gays, lesbians, and transgender\nindividuals implemented that policy without knowing the biological\nsex of any job applicants. Her candid answer was that this would\n\u201cnot\u201d be sex discrimination.[10] And she was right.The attorney\u2019s concession was necessary, but it\nis fatal to the Court\u2019s interpretation, for if an employer\ndiscriminates against individual applicants or employees without\neven knowing whether they are male or female, it is impossible to\nargue that the employer intentionally discriminated because of sex.\nContra,ante, at 19. An employer cannot intentionally\ndiscriminate on the basis of a characteristic of which the employer\nhas no knowledge. And if an employer does not violate Title VII by\ndiscriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity without knowing the sex of the affected individuals, there\nis no reason why the same employer could not lawfully implement the\nsame policy even if it knows the sex of these individuals. If an\nemployer takes an adverse employment action for a perfectly\nlegitimate reason\u2014for example, because an employee stole company\nproperty\u2014that action is not converted into sex discrimination\nsimply because the employer knows the employee\u2019s sex. As explained,\na disparate treatment case requires proof of intent\u2014i.e.,that the employee\u2019s sex motivated the firing. In short, what this\nexample shows is that discrimination because of sexual orientation\nor gender identity does not inherently or necessarily entail\ndiscrimination because of sex, and for that reason, the Court\u2019s\nchief argument collapses.Trying to escape the consequences of the\nattorney\u2019s concession, the Court offers its own hypothetical:\u201cSuppose an employer\u2019s application form\noffered a single box to check if the applicant is either black or\nCatholic. If the employer refuses to hire anyone who checks that\nbox, would we conclude the employer has complied with Title VII, so\nlong as it studiously avoids learning any particular applicant\u2019s\nrace or religion? Of course not.\u201dAnte, at 18.How this hypothetical proves the Court\u2019s point\nis a mystery. A person who checked that box would presumably be\nblack, Catholic, or both, and refusing to hire an applicant because\nof race or religion is prohibited by Title VII. Rejecting\napplicants who checked a box indicating that they are homosexual is\nentirely different because it is impossible to tell from that\nanswer whether an applicant is male or female.The Court follows this strange hypothetical with\nan even stranger argument. The Court argues that an applicant could\nnot answer the question whether he or she is homosexual without\nknowing something about sex. If the applicant was unfamiliar with\nthe term \u201chomosexual,\u201d the applicant would have to look it up or\nask what the term means. And because this applicant would have to\ntake into account his or her sex and that of the persons to whom he\nor she is sexually attracted to answer the question, it follows,\nthe Court reasons, that an employer could not reject this applicant\nwithout taking the applicant\u2019s sex into account. Seeante,\nat 18\u201319.This is illogical. Just because an applicant\ncannot say whether he or she is homosexual without knowing his or\nher own sex and that of the persons to whom the applicant is\nattracted, it does not follow that an employer cannot reject an\napplicant based on homosexuality without knowing the applicant\u2019s\nsex.While the Court\u2019s imagined application form\nproves nothing, another hypothetical case offered by the Court is\ntelling. But what it proves is not what the Court thinks. The Court\nposits:\u201cImagine an employer who has a policy of\nfiring any employee known to be homosexual. The employer hosts an\noffice holiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses.\nA model employee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the\nemployee\u2019s wife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works\nas the employer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the\nmodel employee is a man or a woman.\u201dAnte, at 11.This example disproves the Court\u2019s argument\nbecause it is perfectly clear that the employer\u2019s motivation in\nfiring the female employee had nothing to do with that employee\u2019s\nsex. The employer presumably knew that this employee was a woman\nbefore she was invited to the fateful party. Yet the employer, far\nfrom holding her biological sex against her, rated her a \u201cmodel\nemployee.\u201d At the party, the employer learned something new, her\nsexual orientation, and it was this new information that motivated\nher discharge. So this is another example showing that\ndiscrimination because of sexual orientation does not inherently\ninvolve discrimination because of sex.In addition to the failed argument just\ndiscussed, the Court makes two other arguments, more or less in\npassing. The first of these is essentially that sexual orientation\nand gender identity are closely related to sex. The Court argues\nthat sexual orientation and gender identity are \u201cinextricably bound\nup with sex,\u201dante, at 10, and that discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation or gender identity involves the\napplication of \u201csex-based rules,\u201dante, at 17. This is a\nvariant of an argument found in many of the briefs filed in support\nof the employees and in the lower court decisions that agreed with\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation. All these variants stress that sex,\nsexual orientation, and gender identity are related concepts. The\nSeventh Circuit observed that \u201c[i]t would require considerable\ncalisthenics to remove \u2018sex\u2019 from \u2018sexual orientation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHively, 853 F. 3d, at 350.[11] The Second Circuit wrote that sex is necessarily \u201ca\nfactor in sexual orientation\u201d and further concluded that \u201csexual\norientation is a function of sex.\u201d 883 F.3d 100, 112\u2013113 (CA2 2018)\n(en banc). Bostock\u2019s brief and those ofamicisupporting his\nposition contend that sexual orientation is \u201ca sex-based\nconsideration.\u201d[12] Other\nbriefs state that sexual orientation is \u201ca function of\nsex\u201d[13] or is\n\u201cintrinsically related to sex.\u201d[14] Similarly, Stephens argues that sex and gender\nidentity are necessarily intertwined: \u201cBy definition, a transgender\nperson is someone who lives and identifies with a sex different\nthan the sex assigned to the person at birth.\u201d[15]It is curious to see this argument in an opinion\nthat purports to apply the purest and highest form of textualism\nbecause the argument effectively amends the statutory text. Title\nVII prohibits discrimination because ofsex itself,not\neverything that is related to, based on, or defined with reference\nto, \u201csex.\u201d Many things are related to sex. Think of all the nouns\nother than \u201corientation\u201d that are commonly modified by the\nadjective \u201csexual.\u201d Some examples yielded by a quick computer\nsearch are \u201csexual harassment,\u201d \u201csexual assault, \u201csexual violence,\u201d\n\u201csexual intercourse,\u201d and \u201csexual content.\u201dDoes the Court really think that Title VII\nprohibits discrimination on all these grounds? Is it unlawful for\nan employer to refuse to hire an employee with a record of sexual\nharassment in prior jobs? Or a record of sexual assault or\nviolence?To be fair, the Court does not claim that Title\nVII prohibits discrimination because ofeverythingthat is\nrelated to sex. The Court draws a distinction between things that\nare \u201cinextricably\u201d related and those that are related in \u201csome\nvague sense.\u201dAnte, at 10. Apparently the Court would graft\nonto Title VII some arbitrary line separating the things that are\nrelated closely enough and those that are not.[16] And it would do this in the name of high\ntextualism. An additional argument made in passing also fights the\ntext of Title VII and the policy it reflects. The Court proclaims\nthat \u201c[a]n individual\u2019s homosexuality or transgender status is not\nrelevant to employment decisions.\u201dAnte, at 9. That is the\npolicy view of many people in 2020, and perhaps Congress would have\namended Title VII to implement it if this Court had not intervened.\nBut that is not the policy embodied in Title VII in its current\nform. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on five specified\ngrounds, and neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is on\nthe list. As long as an employer does not discriminate based on one\nof the listed grounds, the employer is free to decide for itself\nwhich characteristics are \u201crelevant to [its] employment decisions.\u201dIbid.By proclaiming that sexual orientation and gender\nidentity are \u201cnot relevant to employment decisions,\u201d the Court\nupdates Title VII to reflect what it regards as 2020 values.The Court\u2019s remaining argument is based on a\nhypothetical that the Court finds instructive. In this\nhypothetical, an employer has two employees who are \u201cattracted to\nmen,\u201d and \u201cto the employer\u2019s mind\u201d the two employees are\n\u201cmaterially identical\u201d except that one is a man and the other is a\nwoman.Ante, at 9 (emphasis added). The Court reasons that\nif the employer fires the man but not the woman, the employer is\nnecessarily motivated by the man\u2019s biological sex.Ante, at\n9\u201310. After all, if two employees are identical in every respect\nbut sex, and the employer fires only one, what other reason could\nthere be?The problem with this argument is that the Court\nloads the dice. That is so because in the mind of an employer who\ndoes not want to employ individuals who are attracted to members of\nthe same sex, these two employees are not materially identical in\nevery respect but sex. On the contrary, they differ in another way\nthat the employer thinks is quite material. And until Title VII is\namended to add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground, this is a\nview that an employer is permitted to implement. As noted, other\nthan prohibiting discrimination on any of five specified grounds,\n\u201crace, color, religion, sex, [and] national origin.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), Title VII allows employers to\ndecide whether two employees are \u201cmaterially identical.\u201d Even\nidiosyncratic criteria are permitted; if an employer thinks that\nScorpios make bad employees, the employer can refuse to hire\nScorpios. Such a policy would be unfair and foolish, but under\nTitle VII, it is permitted. And until Title VII is amended, so is a\npolicy against employing gays, lesbians, or transgender\nindividuals.Once this is recognized, what we have in the\nCourt\u2019s hypothetical case are two employees who differ intwoways\u2013\u2013sex and sexual orientation\u2013\u2013and if the employer\nfires one and keeps the other, all that can be inferred is that the\nemployer was motivated either entirely by sexual orientation,\nentirely by sex, or in part by both. We cannot infer with any\ncertainty, as the hypothetical is apparently meant to suggest, that\nthe employer was motivated even in part by sex. The Court harps on\nthe fact that under Title VII a prohibited ground need not be the\nsole motivation for an adverse employment action, seeante,\nat 10\u201311, 14\u201315, 21, but its example does not show that sex\nnecessarily playedanypart in the employer\u2019s thinking.The Court tries to avoid this inescapable\nconclusion by arguing that sex is really the only difference\nbetween the two employees. This is so, the Court maintains, because\nboth employees \u201care attracted to men.\u201dAnte, at 9\u201310. Of\ncourse, the employer would couch its objection to the man\ndifferently. It would say that its objection was his sexual\norientation. So this may appear to leave us with a battle of\nlabels. If the employer\u2019s objection to the male employee is\ncharacterized as attraction to men, it seems that he is just like\nthe woman in all respects except sex and that the employer\u2019s\ndisparate treatment must be based on that one difference. On the\nother hand, if the employer\u2019s objection is sexual orientation or\nhomosexuality, the two employees differ in two respects, and it\ncannot be inferred that the disparate treatment was due even in\npart to sex.The Court insists that its label is the right\none, and that presumably is why it makes such a point of arguing\nthat an employer cannot escape liability under Title VII by giving\nsex discrimination some other name. Seeante, at 14, 17.\nThat is certainly true, but so is the opposite. Something that isnotsex discrimination cannot be converted into sex\ndiscrimination by slapping on that label. So the Court cannot prove\nits point simply by labeling the employer\u2019s objection as\n\u201cattract[ion] to men.\u201dAnte, at 9\u201310. Rather, the Court\nneeds to show that its label is the correct one.And a labeling standoff would not help the Court\nbecause that would mean that the bare text of Title VII does not\nunambiguously show that its interpretation is right. The Court\nwould have no justification for its stubborn refusal to look any\nfurther.As it turns out, however, there is no standoff.\nIt can easily be shown that the employer\u2019s real objection is not\n\u201cattract[ion] to men\u201d but homosexual orientation.In an effort to prove its point, the Court\ncarefully includes in its example just two employees, a homosexual\nman and a heterosexual woman, but suppose we add two more\nindividuals, a woman who is attracted to women and a man who is\nattracted to women. (A large employer will likely have applicants\nand employees who fall into all four categories, and a small\nemployer can potentially have all four as well.) We now have the\nfour exemplars listed below, with the discharged employees crossed\nout:Man attracted to menWoman attracted to menWoman attracted to womenMan attracted to womenThe discharged employees have one thing in\ncommon. It is not biological sex, attraction to men, or attraction\nto women. It is attraction to members of their own sex\u2014in a word,\nsexual orientation. And that, we can infer, is the employer\u2019s real\nmotive.In sum, the Court\u2019s textual arguments fail on\ntheir own terms. The Court tries to prove that \u201cit is impossible to\ndiscriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender\nwithout discriminating against that individual based on sex,\u201dante,at 9, but as has been shown, it is entirely possible\nfor an employer to do just that. \u201c[H]omosexuality and transgender\nstatus are distinct concepts from sex,\u201dante, at 19, and\ndiscrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status\ndoes not inherently or necessarily constitute discrimination\nbecause of sex. The Court\u2019s arguments are squarely contrary to the\nstatutory text.But even if the words of Title VII did not\ndefinitively refute the Court\u2019s interpretation, that would not\njustify the Court\u2019s refusal to consider alternative\ninterpretations. The Court\u2019s excuse for ignoring everything other\nthan the bare statutory text is that the text is unambiguous and\ntherefore no one can reasonably interpret the text in any way other\nthan the Court does. Unless the Court has met that high standard,\nit has no justification for its blinkered approach. And to say that\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation is the only possible reading is\nindefensible.BAlthough the Court relies solely on the\narguments discussed above, several other arguments figure\nprominently in the decisions of the lower courts and in briefs\nsubmitted by or in support of the employees. The Court apparently\nfinds these arguments unpersuasive, and so do I, but for the sake\nof completeness, I will address them briefly.1One argument, which relies on our decision inPrice Waterhousev.Hopkins,490\nU.S. 228(1989) (plurality opinion), is that discrimination\nbecause of sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII\nbecause it constitutes prohibited discrimination on the basis of\nsex stereotypes. See 883 F. 3d, at 119\u2013123;Hively, 853 F.\n3d, at 346; 884 F.3d 560, 576\u2013577 (CA6 2018). The argument goes\nlike this. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on stereotypes\nabout the way men and women should behave; the belief that a person\nshould be attracted only to persons of the opposite sex and the\nbelief that a person should identify with his or her biological sex\nare examples of such stereotypes; therefore, discrimination on\neither of these grounds is unlawful.This argument fails because it is based on a\nfaulty premise, namely, that Title VII forbids discrimination based\non sex stereotypes. It does not. It prohibits discrimination\nbecause of \u201csex,\u201d and the two concepts are not the same. SeePrice Waterhouse, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 251. That does not\nmean, however, that an employee or applicant for employment cannot\nprevail by showing that a challenged decision was based on a sex\nstereotype. Such evidence is relevant to prove discrimination\nbecause of sex, and it may be convincing where the trait that is\ninconsistent with the stereotype is one that would be tolerated and\nperhaps even valued in a person of the opposite sex. Seeibid.Much of the plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s evidence inPrice Waterhousewas of this nature. The plaintiff was a\nwoman who was passed over for partnership at an accounting firm,\nand some of the adverse comments about her work appeared to\ncriticize her for being forceful and insufficiently \u201cfeminin[e].\u201dId., at 235\u2013236.The main issue inPrice Waterhouse\u2013\u2013the\nproper allocation of the burdens of proof in a so-called mixed\nmotives Title VII case\u2014is not relevant here, but the plurality\nopinion, endorsed by four Justices, commented on the issue of sex\nstereotypes. The plurality observed that \u201csex stereotypes do not\ninevitably prove that gender played a part in a particular\nemployment decision\u201d but \u201ccan certainly beevidencethat\ngender played a part.\u201dId., at 251.[17] And the plurality made it clear that \u201c[t]he\nplaintiff must show that the employer actually relied on her gender\nin making its decision.\u201dIbid.Plaintiffs who allege that they were treated\nunfavorably because of their sexual orientation or gender identity\nare not in the same position as the plaintiff inPrice\nWaterhouse. In cases involving discrimination based on sexual\norientation or gender identity, the grounds for the employer\u2019s\ndecision\u2014that individuals should be sexually attracted only to\npersons of the opposite biological sex or should identify with\ntheir biological sex\u2014apply equally to men and women.\n\u201c[H]eterosexuality is not afemalestereotype; it not amalestereotype; it is not asex- specificstereotype\nat all.\u201dHively, 853 F. 3d, at 370 (Sykes, J.,\ndissenting).To be sure, there may be cases in which a gay,\nlesbian, or transgender individual can make a claim like the one inPrice Waterhouse. That is, there may be cases where traits\nor behaviors that some people associate with gays, lesbians, or\ntransgender individuals are tolerated or valued in persons of one\nbiological sex but not the other. But that is a different\nmatter.2A second prominent argument made in support of\nthe result that the Court now reaches analogizes discrimination\nagainst gays and lesbians to discrimination against a person who is\nmarried to or has an intimate relationship with a person of a\ndifferent race. Several lower court cases have held that\ndiscrimination on this ground violates Title VII. See,e.g.,Holcombv.Iona College, 521 F.3d 130 (CA2 2008);Parrv.Woodmen of World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d 888\n(CA11 1986). And the logic of these decisions, it is argued,\napplies equally where an employee or applicant is treated\nunfavorably because he or she is married to, or has an intimate\nrelationship with, a person of the same sex.This argument totally ignores the historically\nrooted reason why discrimination on the basis of an interracial\nrelationship constitutes race discrimination. And without taking\nhistory into account, it is not easy to see how the decisions in\nquestion fit the terms of Title VII.Recall that Title VII makes it unlawful for an\nemployer to discriminate against an individual \u201cbecause ofsuch\nindividual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a) (emphasis\nadded). So if an employer is happy to employ whites and blacks but\nwill not employ any employee in an interracial relationship, how\ncan it be said that the employer is discriminating against either\nwhites or blacks \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s race\u201d? This employer\nwould be applying the same rule to all its employees regardless of\ntheir race.The answer is that this employer is\ndiscriminating on a ground that history tells us is a core form of\nrace discrimination.[18] \u201cIt\nwould require absolute blindness to the history of racial\ndiscrimination in this country not to understand what is at stake\nin such cases .\u00a0.\u00a0. . A prohibition on \u2018race-mixing\u2019 was\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. grounded in bigotry against a particular race and\nwas an integral part of preserving the rigid hierarchical\ndistinction that denominated members of the black race as inferior\nto whites.\u201d 883 F. 3d, at 158\u2013159 (Lynch, J., dissenting).Discrimination because of sexual orientation is\ndifferent. It cannot be regarded as a form of sex discrimination on\nthe ground that applies in race cases since discrimination because\nof sexual orientation is not historically tied to a project that\naims to subjugate either men or women. An employer who\ndiscriminates on this ground might be called \u201chomophobic\u201d or\n\u201ctransphobic,\u201d but not sexist. SeeWittmerv.Phillips 66\nCo., 915 F.3d 328, 338 (CA5 2019) (Ho, J., concurring).3The opinion of the Court intimates that the\nterm \u201csex\u201d was not universally understood in 1964 to refer just to\nthe categories of male and female, seeante, at 5, and while\nthe Court does not take up any alternative definition as a ground\nfor its decision, I will say a word on this subject.As previously noted, the definitions of \u201csex\u201d in\nthe unabridged dictionaries in use in the 1960s are reproduced in\nAppendix A,infra. Anyone who examines those definitions can\nsee that the primary definition in every one of them refers to the\ndivision of living things into two groups, male and female, based\non biology, and most of the definitions further down the list are\nthe same or very similar. In addition, some definitions refer to\nheterosexual sex acts. See Random House Dictionary 1307 (\u201ccoitus,\u201d\n\u201csexual intercourse\u201d (defs. 5\u20136)); American Heritage Dictionary, at\n1187 (\u201csexual intercourse\u201d (def. 5)).[19]Aside from these, what is there? One definition,\n\u201cto neck passionately,\u201d Random House Dictionary 1307 (def. 8),\nrefers to sexual conduct that is not necessarily heterosexual. But\ncan it be seriously argued that one of the aims of Title VII is to\noutlaw employment discrimination against employees, whether\nheterosexual or homosexual, who engage in necking? And even if\nTitle VII had that effect, that is not what is at issue in cases\nlike those before us.That brings us to the two remaining subsidiary\ndefinitions, both of which refer to sexual urges or instincts and\ntheir manifestations. See the fourth definition in the American\nHeritage Dictionary, at 1187 (\u201cthe sexual urge or instinct as it\nmanifests itself in behavior\u201d), and the fourth definition in both\nWebster\u2019s Second and Third (\u201c[p]henomena of sexual instincts and\ntheir manifestations,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, at\n2296 (2d ed.); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2081\n(1966)). Since both of these come after three prior definitions\nthat refer to men and women, they are most naturally read to have\nthe same association, and in any event, is it plausible that Title\nVII prohibits discrimination based onanysexual urge or\ninstinct and its manifestations? The urge to rape?Viewing all these definitions, the overwhelming\nimpact is that discrimination because of \u201csex\u201d was understood\nduring the era when Title VII was enacted to refer to men and\nwomen. (The same is true of current definitions, which are\nreproduced in Appendix B,infra.) This no doubt explains why\nneither this Court nor any of the lower courts have tried to make\nmuch of the dictionary definitions of sex just discussed.IIASo far, I have not looked beyond dictionary\ndefinitions of \u201csex,\u201d but textualists like Justice Scalia do not\nconfine their inquiry to the scrutiny of dictionaries. See Manning,\nTextualism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 109\n(2001). Dictionary definitions are valuable because they are\nevidence of what people at the time of a statute\u2019s enactment would\nhave understood its words to mean.Ibid.But they are not\nthe only source of relevant evidence, and what matters in the end\nis the answer to the question that the evidence is gathered to\nresolve: How would the terms of a statute have been understood by\nordinary people at the time of enactment?Justice Scalia was perfectly clear on this\npoint. The words of a law, he insisted, \u201cmeanwhat they conveyed\nto reasonable people at the time.\u201d Reading Law, at 16 (emphasis\nadded).[20]Leading proponents of Justice Scalia\u2019s school of\ntextualism have expounded on this principle and explained that it\nis grounded on an understanding of the way language works. As Dean\nJohn F. Manning explains, \u201cthe meaning of language depends on the\nway a linguistic community uses words and phrases in context.\u201d What\nDivides Textualists From Purposivists? 106 Colum. L. Rev. 70, 78\n(2006). \u201c[O]ne can make sense of others\u2019 communications only by\nplacing them in their appropriate social and\nlinguistic\u00a0context,\u201did., at 79\u201380, and this is no less\ntrue of statutes than any other verbal communications. \u201c[S]tatutes\nconvey meaning only because members of a relevant linguistic\ncommunity apply shared background conventions for understanding how\nparticular words are used in particular contexts.\u201d Manning, The\nAbsurdity Doctrine, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2387, 2457 (2003). Therefore,\njudges should ascribe to the words of a statute \u201cwhat a reasonable\nperson conversant with applicable social conventions would have\nunderstood them to be adopting.\u201d Manning, 106 Colum. L. Rev., at\n77. Or, to put the point in slightly different terms, a judge\ninterpreting a statute should ask \u201c\u00a0\u2018what one would ordinarily\nbe understood as saying, given the circumstances in which one said\nit.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Manning, 116 Harv. L. Rev., at 2397\u20132398.Judge Frank Easterbrook has made the same\npoints:\u201cWords are arbitrary signs, having meaning\nonly to the extent writers and readers share an understanding.\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Language in general, and legislation in particular,\nis a social enterprise to which both speakers and listeners\ncontribute, drawing on background understandings and the structure\nand circumstances of the utterance.\u201dHerrmannv.Cencom\nCable Assocs.,Inc., 978 F.2d 978, 982 (CA7 1992).Consequently, \u201c[s]licing a statute into phrases\nwhile ignoring .\u00a0.\u00a0. the setting of the enactment\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is a formula for disaster.\u201dIbid.; see alsoContinental Can Co.v.Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and\nWarehouse Workers Union (Independent) Pension Fund, 916 F.2d\n1154, 1157 (CA7 1990) (\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be Ludwig Wittgenstein or\nHans-Georg Gadamer to know that successful communication depends on\nmeanings shared by interpretive communities\u201d).Thus, when textualism is properly understood, it\ncalls for an examination of the social context in which a statute\nwas enacted because this may have an important bearing on what its\nwords were understood to mean at the time of enactment. Textualists\ndo not read statutes as if they were messages picked up by a\npowerful radio telescope from a distant and utterly unknown\ncivilization. Statutes consist of communications between members of\na particular linguistic community, one that existed in a particular\nplace and at a particular time, and these communications must\ntherefore be interpreted as they were understood by that community\nat that time.For this reason, it is imperative to consider\nhow Americans in 1964 would have understood Title VII\u2019s prohibition\nof discrimination because of sex. To get a picture of this, we may\nimagine this scene. Suppose that, while Title VII was under\nconsideration in Congress, a group of average Americans decided to\nread the text of the bill with the aim of writing or calling their\nrepresentatives in Congress and conveying their approval or\ndisapproval. What would these ordinary citizens have taken\n\u201cdiscrimination because of sex\u201d to mean? Would they have thought\nthat this language prohibited discrimination because of sexual\norientation or gender identity?BThe answer could not be clearer. In 1964,\nordinary Americans reading the text of Title VII would not have\ndreamed that discrimination because of sex meant discrimination\nbecause of sexual orientation, much less gender identity. Theordinary meaningof discrimination because of \u201csex\u201d was\ndiscrimination because of a person\u2019s biological sex, not sexual\norientation or gender identity. The possibility that discrimination\non either of these grounds might fit within some exotic\nunderstanding of sex discrimination would not have crossed their\nminds.1In 1964, the concept of prohibiting\ndiscrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d was no novelty. It was a familiar\nand well-understood concept, and what it meant was equal treatment\nfor men and women.Long before Title VII was adopted, many\npioneering state and federal laws had used language substantively\nindistinguishable from Title VII\u2019s critical phrase, \u201cdiscrimination\nbecause of sex.\u201d For example, the California Constitution of 1879\nstipulated that no one, \u201con account of sex, [could] be\ndisqualified from entering upon or pursuing any lawful business,\nvocation, or profession.\u201d Art. XX, \u00a718 (emphasis added). It also\nprohibited a student\u2019s exclusion from any state university\ndepartment \u201con account of sex.\u201d Art. IX, \u00a79; accord, Mont. Const.,\nArt. XI, \u00a79 (1889).Wyoming\u2019s first Constitution proclaimed broadly\nthat \u201c[b]oth male and female citizens of this state shall equally\nenjoy all civil, political and religious rights and privileges,\u201d\nArt. VI, \u00a71 (1890), and then provided specifically that \u201c[i]n none\nof the public schools .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall distinction or\ndiscrimination be madeon account of sex,\u201d Art. VII, \u00a710\n(emphasis added); see also \u00a716 (the \u201cuniversity shall be equally\nopen to students of both sexes\u201d). Washington\u2019s Constitution\nlikewise required \u201cample provision for the education of all\nchildren .\u00a0.\u00a0. without distinction or preferenceon\naccount of.\u00a0.\u00a0.sex.\u201d Art. IX, \u00a71 (1889)\n(emphasis added).The Constitution of Utah, adopted in 1895,\nprovided that the right to vote and hold public office \u201cshall not\nbe denied or abridgedon account of sex.\u201d Art. IV, \u00a71\n(emphasis added). And in the next sentence it made clear what \u201con\naccount of sex\u201d meant, stating that \u201c[b]oth male and female\ncitizens .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall enjoy equally all civil, political\nand religious rights and privileges.\u201dIbid.The most prominent example of a provision using\nthis language was the Nineteenth Amendment, ratified in 1920, which\nbans the denial or abridgment of the right to vote \u201con account of\nsex.\u201d U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 19. Similar language appeared in the\nproposal of the National Woman\u2019s Party for an Equal Rights\nAmendment. As framed in 1921, this proposal forbade all \u201cpolitical,\ncivil or legal disabilities or inequalitieson account of\nsex, [o]r on account of marriage.\u201d Women Lawyers Meet:\nRepresentatives of 20 States Endorse Proposed Equal Rights\nAmendment, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Sept. 16, 1921, p. 10.Similar terms were used in the precursor to the\nEqual Pay Act. Introduced in 1944 by Congresswoman Winifred C.\nStanley, it proclaimed that \u201c[d]iscrimination against employees, in\nrates of compensation paid,on account of sex\u201d was \u201ccontrary\nto the public interest.\u201d H.\u00a0R. 5056, 78th Cong., 2d Sess.In 1952, the new Constitution for Puerto Rico,\nwhich was approved by Congress, 66Stat. 327, prohibited all\n\u201cdiscrimination .\u00a0.\u00a0.on account of.\u00a0.\u00a0.sex,\u201d Art. II, Bill of Rights \u00a71 (emphasis\nadded), and in the landmark Immigration and Nationality Act of\n1952, Congress outlawed discrimination in naturalization\n\u201cbecause of.\u00a0.\u00a0.sex.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71422 (emphasis added).In 1958, the International Labour Organisation,\na United Nations agency of which the United States is a member,\nrecommended that nations bar employment discrimination \u201cmadeon\nthe basis of.\u00a0.\u00a0.sex.\u201d Convention (No. 111)\nConcerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation,\nArt. 1(a), June 25, 1958, 362 U.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 32\n(emphasis added).In 1961, President Kennedy ordered the Civil\nService Commission to review and modify personnel policies \u201cto\nassure that selection for any career position is hereinafter made\nsolely on the basis of individual merit and fitness,without\nregard to sex.\u201d[21] He\nconcurrently established a \u201cCommission on the Status of Women\u201d and\ndirected it to recommend policies \u201cfor overcoming discriminations\nin government and private employmenton the basis of sex.\u201d\nExec. Order No. 10980, 3 CFR 138 (1961 Supp.) (emphasis added).In short, the concept of discrimination \u201cbecause\nof,\u201d \u201con account of,\u201d or \u201con the basis of\u00a0\u201d sex was well\nunderstood. It was part of the campaign for equality that had been\nwaged by women\u2019s rights advocates for more than a century, and what\nit meant was equal treatment for men and women.[22]2Discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d was not\nunderstood as having anything to do with discrimination because of\nsexual orientation or transgender status. Any such notion would\nhave clashed in spectacular fashion with the societal norms of the\nday.For most 21st-century Americans, it is painful\nto be reminded of the way our society once treated gays and\nlesbians, but any honest effort to understand what the terms of\nTitle VII were understood to mean when enacted must take into\naccount the societal norms of that time. And the plain truth is\nthat in 1964 homosexuality was thought to be a mental disorder, and\nhomosexual conduct was regarded as morally culpable and worthy of\npunishment.In its then-most recent Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (1952) (DSM\u2013I), the American\nPsychiatric Association (APA) classified same-sex attraction as a\n\u201csexual deviation,\u201d a particular type of \u201csociopathic personality\ndisturbance,\u201did., at 38\u201339, and the next edition, issued in\n1968, similarly classified homosexuality as a \u201csexual deviatio[n],\u201d\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 44 (2d ed.)\n(DSM\u2013II). It was not until the sixth printing of the DSM\u2013II in 1973\nthat this was changed.[23]Society\u2019s treatment of homosexuality and\nhomosexual conduct was consistent with this understanding. Sodomy\nwas a crime in every State but Illinois, see W. Eskridge,\nDishonorable Passions 387\u2013407 (2008), and in the District of\nColumbia, a law enacted by Congress made sodomy a felony punishable\nby imprisonment for up to 10 years and permitted the indefinite\ncivil commitment of \u201csexual psychopath[s],\u201d Act of June 9, 1948,\n\u00a7\u00a7104, 201\u2013207, 62Stat. 347\u2013349.[24]This view of homosexuality was reflected in the\nrules governing the federal work force. In 1964, federal\n\u201c[a]gencies could deny homosexual men and women employment because\nof their sexual orientation,\u201d and this practice continued until\n1975. GAO, D. Heivilin, Security Clearances: Consideration of\nSexual Orientation in the Clearance Process 2 (GAO/NSIAD\u201395\u201321,\n1995). See,e.g.,Anonymousv.Macy, 398 F.2d\n317, 318 (CA5 1968) (affirming dismissal of postal employee for\nhomosexual acts).In 1964, individuals who were known to be\nhomosexual could not obtain security clearances, and any who\npossessed clearances were likely to lose them if their orientation\nwas discovered. A 1953 Executive Order provided that background\ninvestigations should look for evidence of \u201csexual perversion,\u201d as\nwell as \u201c[a]ny criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or\nnotoriously disgraceful conduct.\u201d Exec. Order No. 10450,\n\u00a78(a)(1)(iii), 3 CFR 938 (1949\u20131953 Comp.). \u201cUntil about 1991, when\nagencies began to change their security policies and practices\nregarding sexual orientation, there were a number of documented\ncases where defense civilian or contractor employees\u2019 security\nclearances were denied or revoked because of their sexual\norientation.\u201d GAO, Security Clearances, at 2. See,e.g.,Adamsv.Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 240 (CADC 1969)\n(upholding denial of security clearance to defense contractor\nemployee because he had \u201cengaged in repeated homosexual acts\u201d); see\nalsoWebsterv.Doe,486 U.S.\n592, 595, 601 (1988) (concluding that decision to fire a\nparticular individual because he was homosexual fell within the\n\u201cdiscretion\u201d of the Director of Central Intelligence under the\nNational Security Act of 1947 and thus was unreviewable under the\nAPA).The picture in state employment was similar. In\n1964, it was common for States to bar homosexuals from serving as\nteachers. An article summarizing the situation15 years\nafterTitle VII became lawreported that \u201c[a]ll states\nhave statutes that permit the revocation of teaching certificates\n(or credentials) for immorality, moral turpitude, or\nunprofessionalism,\u201d and, the survey added, \u201c[h]omosexuality is\nconsidered to fall within all three categories.\u201d[25]The situation in California is illustrative.\nCalifornia laws prohibited individuals who engaged in \u201cimmoral\nconduct\u201d (which was construed to include homosexual behavior), as\nwell as those convicted of \u201csex offenses\u201d (like sodomy), from\nemployment as teachers. Cal. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a713202, 13207, 13209,\n13218, 13255 (West 1960). The teaching certificates of individuals\nconvicted of engaging in homosexual acts were revoked. See,e.g.,Saracv. State Bd. of Ed.,249 Cal. App. 2d 58, 62\u201364, 57 Cal. Rptr. 69, 72\u201373 (1967)\n(upholding revocation of secondary teaching credential from teacher\nwho was convicted of engaging in homosexual conduct on public\nbeach), overruled in part,Morrisonv.State Bd. of\nEd.,1 Cal. 3d 214, 461 P.2d 375 (1969).In Florida, the legislature enacted laws\nauthorizing the revocation of teaching certificates for \u201cmisconduct\ninvolving moral turpitude,\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7229.08(16) (1961), and\nthis law was used to target homosexual conduct. In 1964, a\nlegislative committee was wrapping up a 6-year campaign to remove\nhomosexual teachers from public schools and state universities. As\na result of these efforts, the state board of education apparently\nrevoked at least 71 teachers\u2019 certificates and removed at least 14\nuniversity professors. Eskridge, Dishonorable Passions, at 103.Individuals who engaged in homosexual acts also\nfaced the loss of other occupational licenses, such as those needed\nto work as a \u201clawyer, doctor, mortician, [or] beautician.\u201d[26] See,e.g.,Florida\nBarv.Kay,232 So. 2d 378(Fla. 1970) (attorney disbarred after conviction\nfor homosexual conduct in public bathroom).In 1964 and for many years thereafter,\nhomosexuals were barred from the military. See,e.g., Army\nReg. 635\u201389, \u00a7I(2) (a) (July 15, 1966) (\u201cPersonnel who voluntarily\nengage in homosexual acts, irrespective of sex, will not be\npermitted to serve in the Army in any capacity, and their prompt\nseparation is mandatory\u201d); Army Reg. 600\u2013443, \u00a7I(2) (April 10,\n1953) (similar). Prohibitions against homosexual conduct by members\nof the military were not eliminated until 2010. See Don\u2019t Ask,\nDon\u2019t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, 124Stat. 3515 (repealing 10\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7654, which required members of the Armed Forces\nto be separated for engaging in homosexual conduct).Homosexuals were also excluded from entry into\nthe United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952\n(INA) excluded aliens \u201cafflicted with psychopathic personality.\u201d 8\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(a)(4) (1964 ed.). InBoutilierv.INS,387 U.S.\n118, 120\u2013123 (1967), this Court, relying on the INA\u2019s\nlegislative history, interpreted that term to encompass homosexuals\nand upheld an alien\u2019s deportation on that ground. Three Justices\ndisagreed with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the phrase\n\u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d[27] But it apparently did not occur to anyone to argue\nthat the Court\u2019s interpretation was inconsistent with the INA\u2019s\nexpress prohibition of discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d That was\nhow our society\u2014and this Court\u2014saw things a half century ago.\nDiscrimination because of sex and discrimination because of sexual\norientation were viewed as two entirely different concepts.To its credit, our society has now come to\nrecognize the injustice of past practices, and this recognition\nprovides the impetus to \u201cupdate\u201d Title VII. But that is not our\njob. Our duty is to understand what the terms of Title VII were\nunderstood to mean when enacted, and in doing so, we must take into\naccount the societal norms of that time. We must therefore ask\nwhether ordinary Americans in 1964 would have thought that\ndiscrimination because of \u201csex\u201d carried some exotic meaning under\nwhich private-sector employers would be prohibited from engaging in\na practice that represented the official policy of the Federal\nGovernment with respect to its own employees. We must ask whether\nAmericans at that time would have thought that Title VII banned\ndiscrimination against an employee for engaging in conduct that\nCongress had made a felony and a ground for civil commitment.The questions answer themselves. Even if\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity could\nbe squeezed into some arcane understanding of sex discrimination,\nthe context in which Title VII was enacted would tell us that this\nis not what the statute\u2019s terms were understood to mean at that\ntime. To paraphrase something Justice Scalia once wrote, \u201cour job\nis not to scavenge the world of English usage to discover whether\nthere is any possible meaning\u201d of discrimination because of sex\nthat might be broad enough to encompass discrimination because of\nsexual orientation or gender identity.Chisomv.Roemer,501 U.S.\n380, 410 (1991) (dissenting opinion). Without strong evidence\nto the contrary (and there is none here), our job is to ascertain\nand apply the \u201cordinarymeaning\u201d of the statute.Ibid. And in 1964, ordinary Americans most certainly would\nnot have understood Title VII to ban discrimination because of\nsexual orientation or gender identity.The Court makes a tiny effort to suggest that at\nleast some people in 1964 might have seen what Title VII really\nmeans.Ante, at 26. What evidence does it adduce? One\ncomplaint filed in 1969, another filed in 1974, and arguments made\nin the mid-1970s about the meaning of the Equal Rights Amendment.Ibid. To call this evidence merely feeble would be\ngenerous.CWhile Americans in 1964 would have been\nshocked to learn that Congress had enacted a law prohibiting sexual\norientation discrimination, they would have been bewildered to hear\nthat this law also forbids discrimination on the basis of\n\u201ctransgender status\u201d or \u201cgender identity,\u201d terms that would have\nleft people at the time scratching their heads. The term\n\u201ctransgender\u201d is said to have been coined \u201c\u00a0\u2018in the early\n1970s,\u2019\u00a0\u201d[28] and the\nterm \u201cgender identity,\u201d now understood to mean \u201c[a]n internal sense\nof being male, female or something else,\u201d[29] apparently first appeared in an academic article\nin 1964.[30] Certainly,\nneither term was in common parlance; indeed, dictionaries of the\ntime still primarily defined the word \u201cgender\u201d by reference to\ngrammatical classifications. See,e.g., American Heritage\nDictionary, at 548 (def. 1(a)) (\u201cAny set of two or more categories,\nsuch as masculine, feminine, and neuter, into which words are\ndivided .\u00a0.\u00a0. and that determine agreement with or\ntheselection of modifiers, referents, or\ngrammatical forms\u201d).While it is likely true that there have always\nbeen individuals who experience what is now termed \u201cgender\ndysphoria,\u201di.e., \u201c[d]iscomfort or distress related to an\nincongruence between an individual\u2019s gender identity and the gender\nassigned at birth,\u201d[31] the\ncurrent understanding of the concept postdates the enactment of\nTitle VII. Nothing resembling what is now called gender dysphoria\nappeared in either DSM\u2013I (1952) or DSM\u2013II (1968). It was not until\n1980 that the APA, in DSM\u2013III, recognized two main psychiatric\ndiagnoses related to this condition, \u201cGender Identity Disorder of\nChildhood\u201d and \u201cTranssexualism\u201d in adolescents and adults.[32] DSM\u2013III, at 261\u2013266.The first widely publicized sex reassignment\nsurgeries in the United States were not performed until\n1966,[33] and the great\nmajority of physicians surveyed in 1969 thought that an individual\nwho sought sex reassignment surgery was either \u201c\u00a0\u2018severely\nneurotic\u2019\u00a0\u201d or \u201c\u00a0\u2018psychotic.\u2019\u00a0\u201d[34]It defies belief to suggest that the public\nmeaning of discrimination because of sex in 1964 encompassed\ndiscrimination on the basis of a concept that was essentially\nunknown to the public at that time.D1The Court\u2019s main excuse for entirely ignoring\nthe social context in which Title VII was enacted is that the\nmeaning of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of discrimination because of sex\nis clear, and therefore it simply does not matter whether people in\n1964 were \u201csmart enough to realize\u201d what its language means.Hively,853 F. 3d, at 357 (Posner, J., concurring).\nAccording to the Court, an argument that looks to the societal\nnorms of those times represents an impermissible attempt to\ndisplace the statutory language.Ante, at 25\u201326.The Court\u2019s argument rests on a false premise.\nAs already explained at length, the text of Title VII does not\nprohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity. And what the public thought about those issues in 1964 is\nrelevant and important, not because it provides a ground for\ndeparting from the statutory text, but because it helps to explain\nwhat the text was understood to mean when adopted.In arguing that we must put out of our minds\nwhat we know about the time when Title VII was enacted, the Court\nrelies on Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion for the Court inOncalev.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U.S.\n75(1998). ButOncaleis nothing like these cases, and\nno one should be taken in by the majority\u2019s effort to enlist\nJustice Scalia in its updating project.The Court\u2019s unanimous decision inOncalewas thoroughly unremarkable. The Court held that a male employee\nwho alleged that he had been sexually harassed at work by other men\nstated a claim under Title VII. Although the impetus for Title\nVII\u2019s prohibition of sex discrimination was to protect women,\nanybody reading its terms would immediately appreciate that it\napplies equally to both sexes, and by the timeOncalereached the Court, our precedent already established that sexual\nharassment may constitute sex discrimination within the meaning of\nTitle VII. SeeMeritor Savings Bank, FSBv.Vinson,477 U.S.\n57(1986). Given these premises, syllogistic reasoning dictated\nthe holding.What today\u2019s decision latches onto areOncale\u2019s comments about whether \u201c\u00a0\u2018male-on-male sexual\nharassment\u2019\u00a0\u201d was on Congress\u2019s mind when it enacted Title\nVII.Ante, at 28 (quoting 523 U.\u00a0S., at 79). The Court\ninOncaleobserved that this specific type of behavior \u201cwas\nassuredly not theprincipal evilCongress was concerned with\nwhen it enacted Title VII,\u201d but it found that immaterial because\n\u201cstatutory prohibitions often go beyond theprincipal evilto cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the\nprovisions of our laws rather than theprincipal concernsof\nour legislators by which we are governed.\u201d 523 U.\u00a0S., at 79\n(emphasis added).It takes considerable audacity to read these\ncomments as committing the Court to a position on deep\nphilosophical questions about the meaning of language and their\nimplications for the interpretation of legal rules. These comments\nare better understood as stating mundane and uncontroversial\ntruths. Who would argue that a statute applies only to the\n\u201cprincipal evils\u201d and not lesser evils that fall within the plain\nscope of its terms? Would even the most ardent \u201cpurposivists\u201d and\nfans of legislative history contend that congressional intent is\nrestricted to Congress\u2019s \u201cprincipalconcerns\u201d?Properly understood,Oncaledoes not\nprovide the slightest support for what the Court has done today.\nFor one thing, it would be a wild understatement to say that\ndiscrimination because of sexual orientation and transgender status\nwas not the \u201cprincipal evil\u201d on Congress\u2019s mind in 1964. Whether we\nlike to admit it now or not, in the thinking of Congress and the\npublic at that time, such discrimination would not have been evil\nat all.But the more important difference between these\ncases andOncaleis that here the interpretation that the\nCourt adopts does not fall within the ordinary meaning of the\nstatutory text as it would have been understood in 1964. To decide\nfor the defendants inOncale, it would have been necessary\nto carve out an exception to the statutory text. Here, no such\nsurgery is at issue. Even if we totally disregard the societal\nnorms of 1964, the text of Title VII does not support the Court\u2019s\nholding. And the reasoning ofOncaledoes not preclude or\ncounsel against our taking those norms into account. They are\nrelevant, not for the purpose of creating an exception to the terms\nof the statute, but for the purpose of better appreciating how\nthose terms would have been understood at the time.2The Court argues that two other\ndecisions\u2013\u2013Phillipsv.Martin Marietta Corp.,400 U.S.\n542(1971) (per\u00a0curiam), andLos Angeles Dept.\nof Water and Powerv.Manhart,435\nU.S. 702(1978)\u2013\u2013buttress its decision, but those cases merely\nheld that Title VII prohibits employer conduct that plainly\nconstitutes discrimination because of biological sex. InPhilips, the employer treated women with young children less\nfavorably than men with young children. InManhart, the\nemployer required women to make larger pension contributions than\nmen. It is hard to see how these holdings assist the Court.The Court extracts three \u201clessons\u201d fromPhillips,Manhart, andOncale, but none sheds\nany light on the question before us. The first lesson is that \u201cit\u2019s\nirrelevant what an employer might call its discriminatory practice,\nhow others might label it, or what else might motivate it.\u201dAnte, at 14. This lesson is obviously true but proves\nnothing. As to the label attached to a practice, has anyone ever\nthought that the application of a law to a person\u2019s conduct depends\non how it is labeled? Could a bank robber escape conviction by\nsaying he was engaged in asset enhancement? So if an employer\ndiscriminates because of sex, the employer is liable no matter what\nit calls its conduct, but if the employer\u2019s conduct is not sex\ndiscrimination, the statute does not apply. Thus, this lesson\nsimply takes us back to the question whether discrimination because\nof sexual orientation or gender identity is a form of\ndiscrimination because of biological sex. For reasons already\ndiscussed, see Part I\u2013A,supra, it is not.It likewise proves nothing of relevance here to\nnote that an employer cannot escape liability by showing that\ndiscrimination on a prohibited ground was not its sole motivation.\nSo long as a prohibited ground was a motivating factor, the\nexistence of other motivating factors does not defeat\nliability.The Court makes much of the argument that \u201c[i]nPhillips, the employer could have accurately spoken of its\npolicy as one based on \u2018motherhood.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 14; see\nalsoante,at 16. But motherhood, by definition, is a\ncondition that can be experienced only by women, so a policy that\ndistinguishes between motherhood and parenthood is necessarily a\npolicy that draws a sex-based distinction. There was sex\ndiscrimination inPhillips, because women with children were\ntreated disadvantageously compared to men with children.Lesson number two\u2014\u201cthe plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s sex\nneed not be the sole or primary cause of the employer\u2019s adverse\naction,\u201dante, at 14\u2014is similarly unhelpful. The standard of\ncausation in these cases is whether sex is necessarily a\n\u201cmotivating factor\u201d when an employer discriminates on the basis of\nsexual orientation or gender identity. 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72000e\u20132(m). But the essential question\u2014whether discrimination\nbecause of sexual orientation or gender identity constitutes sex\ndiscrimination\u2014would be the same no matter what causation standard\napplied. The Court\u2019s extensive discussion of causation standards is\nso much smoke.Lesson number three\u2013\u2013\u201can employer cannot escape\nliability by demonstrating that it treats males and females\ncomparably as groups,\u201dante, at 15, is also irrelevant.\nThere is no dispute that discrimination against an individual\nemployee based on that person\u2019s sex cannot be justified on the\nground that the employer\u2019s treatment of the average employee of\nthat sex is at least as favorable as its treatment of the average\nemployee of the opposite sex. Nor does it matter if an employer\ndiscriminates against only a subset of men or women, where the same\nsubset of the opposite sex is treated differently, as inPhillips. That is not the issue here. An employer who\ndiscriminates equally on the basis of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity applies the same criterion to every affectedindividualregardless of sex. See Part I\u2013A,supra.IIIABecause the opinion of the Court flies a\ntextualist flag, I have taken pains to show that it cannot be\ndefended on textualist grounds. But even if the Court\u2019s textualist\nargument were stronger, that would not explain today\u2019s decision.\nMany Justices of this Court, both past and present, have not\nespoused or practiced a method of statutory interpretation that is\nlimited to the analysis of statutory text. Instead, when there is\nambiguity in the terms of a statute, they have found it appropriate\nto look to other evidence of \u201ccongressional intent,\u201d including\nlegislative history.So, why in these cases are congressional intent\nand the legislative history of Title VII totally ignored? Any\nassessment of congressional intent or legislative history seriously\nundermines the Court\u2019s interpretation.BAs the Court explained inGeneral Elec.\nCo.v.Gilbert,429 U.S.\n125, 143 (1976), the legislative history of Title VII\u2019s\nprohibition of sex discrimination is brief, but it is nevertheless\nrevealing. The prohibition of sex discrimination was \u201cadded to\nTitle VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of\nRepresentatives,\u201dMeritor Savings Bank, 477 U.\u00a0S., at\n63, by Representative Howard Smith, the Chairman of the Rules\nCommittee. See 110 Cong. Rec. 2577 (1964). Representative Smith had\nbeen an ardent opponent of the civil rights bill, and it has been\nsuggested that he added the prohibition against discrimination on\nthe basis of \u201csex\u201d as a poison pill. See,e.g.,Ulanev.Eastern Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1085 (CA7 1984).\nOn this theory, Representative Smith thought that prohibiting\nemployment discrimination against women would be unacceptable to\nMembers who might have otherwise voted in favor of the bill and\nthat the addition of this prohibition might bring about the bill\u2019s\ndefeat.[35] But if\nRepresentative Smith had been looking for a poison pill,\nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or\ngender identity would have been far more potent. However, neither\nRepresentative Smith nor any other Member said one word about the\npossibility that the prohibition of sex discrimination might have\nthat meaning. Instead, all the debate concerned discrimination on\nthe basis of biological sex.[36] See 110 Cong. Rec. 2577\u20132584.Representative Smith\u2019s motivations are\ncontested, 883 F. 3d, at 139\u2013140 (Lynch, J., dissenting), but\nwhatever they were, the meaning ofthe adoption of the\nprohibitionof sex discrimination is clear. It was no accident.\nIt grew out of \u201ca long history of women\u2019s rights advocacy that had\nincreasingly been gaining mainstream recognition and acceptance,\u201d\nand it marked a landmark achievement in the path toward fully equal\nrights for women.Id., at 140. \u201cDiscrimination against gay\nwomen and men, by contrast, was not on the table for public debate\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. [i]n those dark, pre-Stonewall days.\u201dIbid.For those who regard congressional intent as the\ntouchstone of statutory interpretation, the message of Title VII\u2019s\nlegislative history cannot be missed.CPost-enactment events only clarify what was\napparent when Title VII was enacted. As noted, bills to add \u201csexual\norientation\u201d to Title VII\u2019s list of prohibited grounds were\nintroduced in every Congress beginning in 1975, seesupra,\nat 2, and two such bills were before Congress in 1991[37] when it made major changes in\nTitle VII. At that time, the three Courts of Appeals to reach the\nissue had held that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination\nbecause of sexual orientation,[38] two other Circuits had endorsed that interpretation\nin dicta,[39] and no Court\nof Appeals had held otherwise. Similarly, the three Circuits to\naddress the application of Title VII to transgender persons had all\nrejected the argument that it covered discrimination on this\nbasis.[40] These were also\nthe positions of the EEOC.[41] In enacting substantial changes to Title VII, the\n1991 Congress abrogated numerous judicial decisions with which it\ndisagreed. If it also disagreed with the decisions regarding sexual\norientation and transgender discrimination, it could have easily\noverruled those as well, but it did not do so.[42]After 1991, six other Courts of Appeals reached\nthe issue of sexual orientation discrimination, and until 2017,\nevery single Court of Appeals decision understood Title VII\u2019s\nprohibition of \u201cdiscrimination because of sex\u201d to mean\ndiscrimination because of biological sex.\nSee,e.g.,Higginsv.New Balance\nAthletic Shoe, Inc.,194\nF.3d 252, 259 (CA1 1999);Simontonv.Runyon,232\nF.3d 33, 36 (CA2 2000);Bibbyv.Philadelphia\nCoca Cola Bottling Co.,260\nF.3d 257, 261 (CA3 2001), cert. denied,\u00a0 534 U.S. 1155\n(2002);Wrightsonv.Pizza Hut of Am.,\nInc.,99\nF.3d 138, 143 (CA4 1996);Hammv.Weyauwega Milk\nProducts, Inc.,332\nF.3d 1058, 1062 (CA7 2003);Medinav.Income\nSupport Div.,N.\u00a0M.,413\nF.3d 1131, 1135 (CA10 2005);Evansv.Georgia\nRegional Hospital,\u00a0850 F.3d 1248, 1255 (CA11), cert.\ndenied,\u00a0583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017). Similarly, the other\nCircuit to formally address whether Title VII applies to claims of\ndiscrimination based on transgender status had also rejected the\nargument, creating unanimous consensus prior to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\ndecision below. SeeEtsittyv.Utah Transit\nAuthority, 502 F.3d 1215, 1220\u20131221 (CA10 2007).The Court observes that \u201c[t]he people are\nentitled to rely on the law as written, without fearing that courts\nmight disregard its plain terms,\u201dante, at 24, but it has no\nqualms about disregarding over 50 years of uniform judicial\ninterpretation of Title VII\u2019s plain text. Rather, the Court makes\nthe jaw-dropping statement that its decision exemplifies \u201cjudicial\nhumility.\u201dAnte, at 31. Is it humble to maintain, not only\nthat Congress did not understand the terms it enacted in 1964, but\nthat all the Circuit Judges on all the pre-2017 cases could not see\nwhat the phrase discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d really means? If\ntoday\u2019s decision is humble, it is sobering to imagine what the\nCourt might do if it decided to be bold.IVWhat the Court has done today\u2013\u2013interpreting\ndiscrimination because of \u201csex\u201d to encompass discrimination because\nof sexual orientation or gender identity\u2013\u2013is virtually certain to\nhave far-reaching consequences. Over 100 federal statutes prohibit\ndiscrimination because of sex. See Appendix C,infra;e.g., 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681(a) (Title IX); 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73631 (Fair Housing Act); 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n1691(a)(1) (Equal Credit Opportunity Act). The briefs in these\ncases have called to our attention the potential effects that the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning may have under some of these laws, but the Court\nwaves those considerations aside. As to Title VII itself, the Court\ndismisses questions about \u201cbathrooms, locker rooms, or anything\nelse of the kind.\u201dAnte, at 31. And it declines to say\nanything about other statutes whose terms mirror Title VII\u2019s.The Court\u2019s brusque refusal to consider the\nconsequences of its reasoning is irresponsible. If the Court had\nallowed the legislative process to take its course, Congress would\nhave had the opportunity to consider competing interests and might\nhave found a way of accommodating at least some of them. In\naddition, Congress might have crafted special rules for some of the\nrelevant statutes. But by intervening and proclaiming categorically\nthat employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or\ngender identity is simply a form of discrimination because of sex,\nthe Court has greatly impeded\u2014and perhaps effectively ended\u2014any\nchance of a bargained legislative resolution. Before issuing\ntoday\u2019s radical decision, the Court should have given some thought\nto where its decision would lead.As the briefing in these cases has warned, the\nposition that the Court now adopts will threaten freedom of\nreligion, freedom of speech, and personal privacy and safety. No\none should think that the Court\u2019s decision represents an unalloyed\nvictory for individual liberty.I will briefly note some of the potential\nconsequences of the Court\u2019s decision, but I do not claim to provide\na comprehensive survey or to suggest how any of these issues should\nnecessarily play out under the Court\u2019s reasoning.[43]\u201c[B]athrooms, locker rooms, [and other\nthings] of [that] kind.\u201dThe Court may wish to avoid this\nsubject, but it is a matter of concern to many people who are\nreticent about disrobing or using toilet facilities in the presence\nof individuals whom they regard as members of the opposite sex. For\nsome, this may simply be a question of modesty, but for others,\nthere is more at stake. For women who have been victimized by\nsexual assault or abuse, the experience of seeing an unclothed\nperson with the anatomy of a male in a confined and sensitive\nlocation such as a bathroom or locker room can cause serious\npsychological harm.[44]Under the Court\u2019s decision, however, transgender\npersons will be able to argue that they are entitled to use a\nbathroom or locker room that is reserved for persons of the sex\nwith which they identify, and while the Court does not define what\nit means by a transgender person, the term may apply to individuals\nwho are \u201cgender fluid,\u201d that is, individuals whose gender identity\nis mixed or changes over time.[45] Thus, a person who has not undertaken any physical\ntransitioning may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker\nroom assigned to the sex with which the individual identifies at\nthat particular time. The Court provides no clue why a transgender\nperson\u2019s claim to such bathroom or locker room access might not\nsucceed.A similar issue has arisen under Title IX, which\nprohibits sex discrimination by any elementary or secondary school\nand any college or university that receives federal financial\nassistance.[46] In 2016, a\nDepartment of Justice advisory warned that barring a student from a\nbathroom assigned to individuals of the gender with which the\nstudent identifies constitutes unlawful sex\ndiscrimination,[47] and some\nlower court decisions have agreed. SeeWhitakerv.Kenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Ed., 858 F.3d\n1034, 1049 (CA7 2017);G. G.v.Gloucester Cty.

Another issue that may\ncome up under both Title VII and Title IX is the right of a\ntransgender individual to participate on a sports team or in an\nathletic competition previously reserved for members of one\nbiological sex.[48] This\nissue has already arisen under Title IX, where it threatens to\nundermine one of that law\u2019s major achievements, giving young women\nan equal opportunity to participate in sports. The effect of the\nCourt\u2019s reasoning may be to force young women to compete against\nstudents who have a very significant biological advantage,\nincluding students who have the size and strength of a male but\nidentify as female and students who are taking male hormones in\norder to transition from female to male. See,e.g.,\nComplaint inSoulev.Connecticut Assn. of Schools,\nNo. 3:20\u2013cv\u201300201 (D Conn., Apr. 17, 2020) (challenging Connecticut\npolicy allowing transgender students to compete in girls\u2019 high\nschool sports); Complaint inHecoxv.Little, No.\n1:20\u2013cv\u201300184 (D Idaho, Apr. 15, 2020) (challenging state law that\nbars transgender students from participating in school sports in\naccordance with gender identity). Students in these latter\ncategories have found success in athletic competitions reserved for\nfemales.[49]The logic of the Court\u2019s decision could even\naffect professional sports. Under the Court\u2019s holding that Title\nVII prohibits employment discrimination because of transgender\nstatus, an athlete who has the physique of a man but identifies as\na woman could claim the right to play on a women\u2019s professional\nsports team. The owners of the team might try to claim that\nbiological sex is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ)\nunder 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(e), but the BFOQ exception has\nbeen read very narrowly. SeeDothardv.Rawlinson,433 U.S.\n321, 334 (1977).Housing. The Court\u2019s decision may lead to\nTitle IX cases against any college that resists assigning students\nof the opposite biological sex as roommates. A provision of Title\nIX, 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71686, allows schools to maintain\n\u201cseparate living facilities for the different sexes,\u201d but it may be\nargued that a student\u2019s \u201csex\u201d is the gender with which the student\nidentifies.[50] Similar\nclaims may be brought under the Fair Housing Act. See 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73604.Employment by religious organizations.\nBriefs filed by a wide range of religious groups\u2013\u2013Christian,\nJewish, and Muslim\u2013\u2013express deep concern that the position now\nadopted by the Court \u201cwill trigger open conflict with faith-based employment practices of numerous churches,\nsynagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions.\u201d[51] They argue that \u201c[r]eligious\norganizations need employees who actually live the faith,\u201d[52] and that compelling a religious\norganization to employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets\nof the organization\u2019s faith forces the group to communicate an\nobjectionable message.This problem is perhaps most acute when it comes\nto the employment of teachers. A school\u2019s standards for its faculty\n\u201ccommunicate a particular way of life to its students,\u201d and a\n\u201cviolation by the faculty of those precepts\u201d may undermine the\nschool\u2019s \u201cmoral teaching.\u201d[53] Thus, if a religious school teaches that sex outside\nmarriage and sex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message\nmay be lost if the school employs a teacher who is in a same-sex\nrelationship or has undergone or is undergoing sex reassignment.\nYet today\u2019s decision may lead to Title VII claims by such teachers\nand applicants for employment.At least some teachers and applicants for\nteaching positions may be blocked from recovering on such claims by\nthe \u201cministerial exception\u201d recognized inHosanna-Tabor\nEvangelical Lutheran Church and Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171(2012). Two cases now pending before the Court present the\nquestion whether teachers who provide religious instruction can be\nconsidered to be \u201cministers.\u201d[54] But even if teachers with those responsibilities\nqualify, what about other very visible school employees who may not\nqualify forthe ministerial exception? Provisions of Title\nVII provide exemptions for certain religious organizations and\nschools \u201cwith respect to the employment of individuals of a\nparticular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on\u201d\nof the \u201cactivities\u201d of the organization or school, 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20131(a); see also \u00a72000e\u20132(e)(2), but the\nscope of these provisions is disputed, and as interpreted by some\nlower courts, they provide only narrow protection.[55]Healthcare. Healthcare benefits may\nemerge as an intense battleground under the Court\u2019s holding.\nTransgender employees have brought suit under Title VII to\nchallenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not\ncover costly sex reassignment surgery.[56] Similar claims have been brought under the\nAffordable Care Act (ACA), which broadly prohibits sex\ndiscrimination in the provision of healthcare.[57]Such claims present difficult religious liberty\nissues because some employers and healthcare providers have strong\nreligious objections to sex reassignment procedures, and therefore\nrequiring them to pay for or to perform these procedures will have\na severe impact on their ability to honor their deeply held\nreligious beliefs.Freedom of speech. The Court\u2019s decision\nmay even affect the way employers address their employees and the\nway teachers and school officials address students. Under\nestablished English usage, two sets of sex-specific singular\npersonal pronouns are used to refer to someone in the third person\n(he, him, and his for males; she, her, and hers for females). But\nseveral different sets of gender-neutral pronouns have now been\ncreated and are preferred by some individuals who do not identify\nas falling into either of the two traditional categories.[58] Some jurisdictions, such as New\nYork City, have ordinances making the failure to use an\nindividual\u2019s preferred pronoun a punishable offense,[59] and some colleges have similar\nrules.[60] After today\u2019s\ndecision, plaintiffs may claim that the failure to use their\npreferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibiting sex\ndiscrimination. SeePrescottv.Rady Children\u2019s Hospital\nSan Diego, 265 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1098\u20131100 (SD Cal. 2017)\n(hospital staff\u00a0\u2019s refusal to use preferred pronoun violates\nACA).[61]The Court\u2019s decision may also pressure employers\nto suppress any statements by employees expressing disapproval of\nsame-sex relationships and sex reassignment procedures. Employers\nare already imposing such restrictions voluntarily, and after\ntoday\u2019s decisions employers will fear that allowing employees to\nexpress their religious views on these subjects may give rise to\nTitle VII harassment claims.Constitutional claims. Finally, despite\nthe important differences between the Fourteenth Amendment and\nTitle VII, the Court\u2019s decision may exert a gravitational pull in\nconstitutional cases. Under our precedents, the Equal Protection\nClause prohibits sex-based discrimination unless a \u201cheightened\u201d\nstandard of review is met.Sessionsv.Morales-Santana, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op.,\nat 8);United Statesv.Virginia,518 U.S.\n515, 532\u2013534 (1996). By equating discrimination because of\nsexual orientation or gender identity with discrimination because\nof sex, the Court\u2019s decision will be cited as a ground for\nsubjecting all three forms of discrimination to the same exacting\nstandard of review.Under this logic, today\u2019s decision may have\neffects that extend well beyond the domain of federal anti-\ndiscrimination statutes. This potential is illustrated by pending\nand recent lower court cases in which transgender individuals have\nchallenged a variety of federal, state, and local laws and policies\non constitutional grounds. See,e.g., Complaint inHecox, No. 1: 20\u2013CV\u201300184 (state law prohibiting transgender\nstudents from competing in school sports in accordance with their\ngender identity); Second Amended Complaint inKarnoskiv.Trump, No. 2:17\u2013cv\u201301297 (WD Wash., July 31, 2019)\n(military\u2019s ban on transgender members);Kadelv.Folwell, ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d ___, ___\u2013___, 2020 WL 1169271,\n*10\u2013*11 (MDNC, Mar. 11, 2020) (state health plan\u2019s exclusion of\ncoverage for sex reassignment procedures); Complaint inGorev.Lee, No. 3:19\u2013cv\u201300328 (MD Tenn., Mar. 3, 2020) (change\nof gender on birth certificates); Brief for Appellee inGrimmv.Gloucester Cty.

The entire Federal Judiciary will be mired\nfor years in disputes about the reach of the Court\u2019s reasoning.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The updating desire to which the Court\nsuccumbs no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses.

Sex is manifested in the\nconjugating cells by the larger size, abundant food material, and\nimmobility of the female gamete (egg,egg cell, orovum), and the small size and the locomotive power of the\nmale gamete (spermatozoonorspermatozoid), and in\nthe adult organisms often by many structural, physiological, and\n(in higher forms) psychological characters, aside from the\nnecessary modification of the reproductive apparatus. Cf.\nHERMAPHRODITE, 1. In botany the termsexis often extended\nto the distinguishing peculiarities of staminate and pistillate\nflowers, and hence in dioecious plants to the individuals bearing\nthem.In many animals and plants the body and germ\ncells have been shown to contain one or more chromosomes of a\nspecial kind (calledsex chromosomes; idiochromosomes; accessory\nchromosomes) in addition to the ordinary paired autosomes.\nThese special chromosomes serve to determine sex. In the simplest\ncase, the male germ cells are of two types, one with and one\nwithout a single extra chromosome (X chromosome, ormonosome). The egg cells in this case all possess anXchromosome, and on fertilization by the two types\nof sperm, male and female zygotes result, of respective\nconstitutionX, andXX. In many other animals and\nplants (probably including man) the male organism produces two\ntypes of gametes, one possessing anX chromosome, the other\naY chromosome, these being visibly different members of a\npair of chromosomes present in the diploid state. In this case\nalso, the female organism isXX, the eggsX, and the\nzygotes respectively male (XY) and female (XX). In\nanother type of sex determination, as in certain moths and possibly\nin the fowl, the female produces two kinds of eggs, the male only\none kind of sperm. Each type of egg contains one member of a pair\nof differentiated chromosomes, called respectivelyZ\nchromosomesandW chromosomes, while all the sperm cells\ncontain aZchromosome. In fertilization, union of aZwith aWgives rise to a female, while union of twoZchromosomes produces a male.

SeeHivelyv.Ivy Tech Community College of Ind., 853 F.3d 339 (2017) (en\nbanc). Judge Posner agreed with that result but wrote: \u201cI would\nprefer to see us acknowledge openly that today we, who are judges\nrather than members of Congress, are imposing on a half-century-old\nstatute a meaning of \u2018sex discrimination\u2019 that the Congress that\nenacted it would not have accepted.\u201dId., at 357\n(concurring opinion) (emphasis added).6The Court does not define\nwhat it means by \u201ctransgender status,\u201d but the American\nPsychological Association describes \u201ctransgender\u201d as \u201c[a]n umbrella\nterm encompassing those whose gender identities or gender roles\ndiffer from those typically associated with the sex they were\nassigned at birth.\u201d A Glossary: Defining Transgender Terms, 49\nMonitor on Psychology 32 (Sept. 2018),\nhttps://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/09/ce-corner-glossary.

The statute specifies\nthat the terms \u201cbecause of sex\u201d and \u201con the basis of sex\u201d cover\ncertain conditions that are biologically tied to sex,namely,\n\u201cpregnancy, childbirth, [and] related medical conditions.\u201d 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k). This definition should inform the\nmeaning of \u201cbecause of sex\u201d in Title VII more generally.

A study searched a vast database\nof documents from that time to determine how the phrase\n\u201cdiscriminate against .\u00a0.\u00a0. because of [some trait]\u201d was\nused.

The study found that the phrase\nwas used to denote discrimination against \u201csomeone .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmotivated by prejudice, or biased ideas or attitudes\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. directed at people with that trait in particular.\u201dId., at 7 (emphasis deleted).

Thus, as used in 1964, \u201cdiscrimination because of sex\u201d would\nhave been understood to mean discrimination against a woman or a\nman based on \u201cunfair beliefs or attitudes\u201d about members of that\nparticular sex.Id.,at 7.23APA,\nHomosexuality and Sexual Orientation Disturbance: Proposed Change\nin DSM\u2013II, 6th Printing, p. 44 (APA Doc.
