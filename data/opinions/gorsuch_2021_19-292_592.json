On the majority\u2019s\naccount, a Fourth Amendment \u201cseizure\u201d takes place whenever an\nofficer \u201cmerely touches\u201d a suspect. It\u2019s a seizure even if the\nsuspect refuses to stop, evades capture, and rides off into the\nsunset never to be seen again. That view is as mistaken as it is\nnovel.Until today, a Fourth Amendment \u201cseizure\u201d has\nrequired taking possession of someone or something. To reach its\ncontrary judgment, the majority must conflate a seizure with its\nattempt and confuse an arrest with a battery. In the process, too,\nthe majority must disregard the Constitution\u2019s original and\nordinary meaning, dispense with our conventional interpretive\nrules, and bypass the main currents of the common law. Unable to\nrely on any of these traditional sources of authority, the majority\nis left to lean on (really, repurpose) an abusive and\nlong-abandoned English debt-collection practice. But there is a\nreason why, in two centuries filled with litigation over the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s meaning, this Court has never before adopted the\nmajority\u2019s definition of a \u201cseizure.\u201d Neither the Constitution nor\ncommon sense can sustain it.IAThis case began when two Albuquerque police\nofficers approached Roxanne Torres on foot. The officers thought\nMs. Torres was the subject of an arrest warrant and suspected of\ninvolvement in murder and drug trafficking. As it turned out, they\nhad the wrong person; Ms. Torres was the subject of adifferentarrest warrant. As she saw the officers walk\ntoward her, Ms. Torres responded by getting into her car and\nhitting the gas. At the time, Ms. Torres admits, she was \u201ctripping\nout bad\u201d on methamphetamine. Fearing the oncoming car was about to\nhit them, the officers fired their duty weapons, and two bullets\nstruck Ms. Torres while others hit her car.None of that stopped Ms. Torres. She continued\ndriving\u2014over a curb, across some landscaping, and into a street,\neventually colliding with another vehicle. Abandoning her car, she\npromptly stole a different one parked nearby. Ms. Torres then drove\nover 75 miles to another city. When she eventually sought medical\ntreatment, doctors decided she needed to be airlifted back to\nAlbuquerque for more intensive care. Only at that point, a day\nafter her encounter with the officers, was Ms. Torres finally\nidentified and arrested. Ultimately, she pleaded no contest to\nassault on a police officer, aggravated fleeing from an officer,\nand the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle.More than two years later, Ms. Torres sued the\nofficers for damages in federal court under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71983. She alleged that they had violated the Fourth Amendment by\nunreasonably \u201cseizing\u201d her. After discovery, the officers moved for\nsummary judgment. The district court granted the motion, and the\ncourt of appeals affirmed. Individuals like Ms. Torres are free to\nsue officers under New Mexico state law for assault or battery.\nThey may also sue officers under the Fourteenth Amendment for\nconduct that \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d But under longstanding\ncircuit precedent, the courts explained, a Fourth Amendment\n\u201cseizure\u201d occurs only when the government obtains \u201cphysical\ncontrol\u201d over a person or object. Because Ms. Torres \u201cmanaged to\nelude the police for at least a full day after being shot,\u201d the\ncourts reasoned, the officers\u2019 bullets had not \u201cseized\u201d her; any\nseizure took place only when she was finally arrested back in\nAlbuquerque the following day.Torresv.Madrid, 769\nFed. Appx. 654, 657 (CA10 2019).BNow before us, Ms. Torres argues that this\nCourt\u2019s decision inCaliforniav.Hodari D.,499 U.S.\n621(1991), \u201ccompel[s] reversal.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 25. As\nshe reads it,Hodari D.held that a Fourth Amendment seizure\ntakes place whenever an officer shoots or even \u201cmere[ly] touch[es]\u201d\nan individual with the intent to restrain. Brief for Petitioner\n15.Whatever one thinks of Ms. Torres\u2019s argument,\none thing is certain:Hodari D.has generated considerable\nconfusion. There, officers chased a suspect on foot. 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 623. Later, the suspect argued that he was \u201cseized\u201d\nfor purposes of the Fourth Amendment the moment the chase began.\nSeeid., at 625. Thoughhefled, the suspect argued,\na \u201creasonable person\u201d would not have felt at liberty given the\nofficers\u2019 \u201cshow of authority,\u201d so a Fourth Amendment seizure had\noccurred.Id., at 627\u2013628.The Court rejected this argument. In doing so,\nit explained that, \u201c[f]rom the time of the founding to the present,\nthe word \u2018seizure\u2019 has meant a \u2018taking possession.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 624. Because the defendant did not submit to the\nofficers\u2019 show of authority, the Court reasoned, the officers\u2019\nconduct amounted at most to an attempted seizure. Seeid.,\nat 626, and n.\u00a02. And \u201cneither usage nor common-law tradition\nmakes anattemptedseizure a seizure.\u201dIbid.At the same time, and as Ms. Torres emphasizes,\nthe Court didn\u2019t end its discussion there. It proceeded to imagine\na different and hypothetical case, one in which the officers not\nonly chased the suspect but also \u201cappl[ied] physical force\u201d to him.\nIn these circumstances, the Court suggested, \u201cmerely touching\u201d a\nsuspect, even when officers fail to gain possession, might qualify\nas a seizure.Id., at 624\u2013625.Unsurprisingly, these dueling passages inHodari D.led to a circuit split. For the first time, some\nlower courts began holding that a \u201cmere touch\u201d constitutes a Fourth\nAmendment \u201cseizure.\u201d Others, however, continued to adhere to the\nview, taken \u201c[f]rom the time of the founding to the present,\u201d that\nthe word \u201cseizure\u201d means \u201ctaking possession.\u201dId., at 624\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We took this case to sort out\nthe confusion.IIAs an initial matter, Ms. Torres is mistaken\nthatHodari D.\u2019s discussion of \u201cmere touch\u201d seizures compels\na ruling in her favor. Under the doctrine ofstare decisis,\nwe normally afford prior holdings of this Court considerable\nrespect. But, in the course of issuing their holdings, judges\nsometimes include a \u201cwitty opening paragraph, the background\ninformation on how the law developed,\u201d or \u201cdigressions speculating\non how similar hypothetical cases might be resolved.\u201d B. Garner\net\u00a0al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 44 (2016). Such asides\nare dicta. The label is hardly an epithet: \u201cDicta may afford\nlitigants the benefit of a fuller understanding of the court\u2019s\ndecisional path or related areas of concern.\u201dId., at 65.\nDicta can also \u201cbe a source of advice to successors.\u201dIbid.But whatever utility it may have, dicta cannot bind future\ncourts.This ancient rule serves important purposes. A\npassage unnecessary to the outcome may not be fully considered.\nParties with little at stake in a hypothetical question may afford\nit little or no adversarial testing. And, of course, federal courts\npossess no authority to issue rulings beyond the cases and\ncontroversies before them. If the respect we afford past holdings\nunder the doctrine ofstare decisismay be justified in part\nas an act of judicial humility, respecting that doctrine\u2019s limits\nmust be too. Fewer things could be less humble than insisting our\nevery passing surmise constitutes a rule forever binding a Nation\nof over 300 million people. No judge can see around every corner,\npredict the future, or fairly resolve matters not at issue. See,e.g.,Cohensv.Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264,\n399\u2013400 (1821);Central Va. Community Collegev.Katz,546 U.S.\n356, 363 (2006).On any account, the passage inHodari D.Ms. Torres seeks to invoke was dicta. The only question presented\nin that case was whether officers seize a defendant by a show of\nauthoritywithouttouching him. The Court answered that\nquestion in the negative. The separate question whether a \u201cmere\ntouch\u201dalsoqualifies as a seizure was not presented by\nfacts of the case. No party briefed the issue. And the opinion\noffered the matter only shallow consideration, resting on just\nthree sources: A state court opinion from the 1860s, a \u201ccomment\u201d in\nthe 1934 Restatement of Torts, and a 1930s legal treatise. See 499\nU.\u00a0S., at 624\u2013625.Already some lower courts, including those\nbelow, have recognized thatHodari D.\u2019s aside does not\nconstitute a binding holding. SeeBrooksv.Gaenzle,\n614 F.3d 1213, 1220\u20131221 (CA10 2010);Hensonv.United\nStates, 55 A.3d 859, 864\u2013865 (D.\u00a0C. 2012). Today\u2019s\nmajority seems to accept the point too. It acknowledges thatHodari D.\u201cprincipally concerned a show of authority.\u201dAnte, at 4. And it says it intends to rule for Ms. Torres\n\u201cindependently\u201d ofHodari D.Ante, at 4.IIISeeking to carry that burden, the majority\npicks up whereHodari D.\u2019s dicta left off. It contends that\nan officer \u201cseizes\u201d a person by merely touching him with an \u201cintent\nto restrain.\u201dAnte, at 9. We are told that a touch is a\nseizure even if the suspect never stops or slows down; it\u2019s a\nseizure even if he evades capture. In all the years beforeHodari D.\u2019s dicta, this conclusion would have sounded more\nthan a little improbable to most lawyers and judges\u2014as it should\nstill today. A mere touch may be a battery. It may even be part of\nan attempted seizure. But the Fourth Amendment\u2019s text, its history,\nand our precedent all confirm that \u201cseizing\u201d something doesn\u2019t mean\ntouching it; it means taking possession.AStart with the text. The Fourth Amendment\nguarantees that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d As at least part ofHodari\nD.recognized, \u201c[f\u00a0]rom the time of the founding to the\npresent,\u201d the key term here\u2014\u201cseizure\u201d\u2014has always meant\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018taking possession.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 499 U.\u00a0S., at 624.Countless contemporary dictionaries define a\n\u201cseizure\u201d or the act of \u201cseizing\u201d in terms of possession.[1] This Court\u2019s early cases reflect the\nsame understanding. Just sixteen years after the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nadoption, Congress passed a statute regulating the \u201cseizure\u201d of\nships. SeeThe Josefa Segunda, 10 Wheat. 312, 322 (1825).\nThis Court interpreted the term to require \u201can open, visible\npossession claimed,\u201d so that those previously possessing the ship\n\u201cunderstand that they are dispossessed, and that they are no longer\nat liberty to exercise any dominion on board of the ship.\u201dId., at 325. Nor did the Court\u2019s view change over time. InPelhamv.Rose, 9 Wall. 103, 106 (1870), the Court\nlikewise explained that \u201c[t]o effect [a] seizure\u201d of something, one\nneeded \u201cto take\u201d the thing \u201cinto his actual custody and control.\u201dId., at 107.Today\u2019s majority disputes none of this. It\naccepts that a seizure of the inanimate objects mentioned in the\nFourth Amendment (houses, papers, and effects) requires possession.Ante, at 4. And when it comes to persons, the majority\nagrees (asHodari D.held) that a seizure in response to a\n\u201cshow of authority\u201d takes place if and when the suspect submits to\nan officer\u2019s possession.Ante, at 15. The majority insists\nthat a different rule should applyonlyin cases where an\nofficer \u201ctouches\u201d the suspect. Here\u2014and here alone\u2014possession is\nnot required. So, under the majority\u2019s logic, we are quite\nliterally asked to believe the officers in this case \u201cseized\u201d Ms.\nTorres\u2019s person, butnother car, when they shot both and\nboth continued speeding down the highway.The majority\u2019s need to resort to such a\nschizophrenic reading of the word \u201cseizure\u201d should be a signal that\nsomething has gone seriously wrong. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s Search\nand Seizure Clause uses the word \u201cseizures\u201d once in connection with\nfour objects (persons, houses, papers, and effects). The text thus\nsuggests parity, not disparity, in meaning. It is close to canon\nthat when a provision uses the same word multiple times, courts\nmust give it the same meaning each time.Ratzlafv.United States,510 U.S.\n135, 143 (1994). And itiscanonical that courts cannot\ngive a single word different meanings depending on the happenstance\nof \u201cwhich object it is modifying.\u201dRenov.Bossier Parish\nSchool Bd.,528 U.S.\n320, 329 (2000) (\u201c[W]e refuse to adopt a construction that\nwould attribute different meanings to the same phrase in the same\nsentence, depending on which object it is modifying\u201d). To\n\u201c[a]scrib[e] various meanings\u201d to a single word, we have observed,\nis to \u201crender meaning so malleable\u201d that written laws risk\n\u201cbecom[ing] susceptible to individuated interpretation.\u201dRatzlaf, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 143 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The majority\u2019s conclusion that a single use of the word\n\u201cseizures\u201d bears two different meanings at the same time\u2014indeed, in\nthis very case\u2014is truly novel. And when it comes to construing the\nConstitution, that kind of innovation is no virtue.If more textual evidence were needed, the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s neighboring Warrant Clause would seem to provide it.\nThat Clause states that warrants must describe \u201cthe persons or\nthings to be seized.\u201d Once more, the Amendment uses the same\nverb\u2014\u201cseized\u201d\u2014for both persons and objects. Once more, it suggests\nparity, not some hidden divergence between people and their\npossessions. Nor does anyone dispute that a warrant for the\n\u201cseizure\u201d of a person means a warrant authorizing officers to take\nthat person into theirpossession.Against all these adverse textual clues, the\nmajority offers little in reply. Itadmitsthat its\ninterpretation defies this Court\u2019s teachings inRatzlafandRenoby ascribing different meanings to the word \u201cseizure\u201d\ndepending on \u201cthe object being seized.\u201dAnte, at 16. It says\nonly that we should overlook the problem because \u201cour cases\u201d in the\nFourth Amendment context compel this remarkable construction.Ibid.But it is unclear what cases the majority might have\nin mind for it cites none.Instead, the majority proceeds to reason that\nthe word \u201cseizure\u201dmustcarry a different meaning for\npersons and objects because persons alone are \u201ccapable of fleeing\u201d\nand have \u201can interest in doing so.\u201dIbid.But that reasoning\nfaces trouble even fromHodari D., which explained that \u201c[a]\nship still fleeing, even though under attack, would not be\nconsidered to have been seized as a war prize.\u201d 499 U.\u00a0S., at\n624. Of course, as the majority observes, persons alone can possess\n\u201can interest\u201d in fleeing. But, asHodari D.\u2019s example shows,\nthey can have as much (or more) interest in fleeing to prevent the\nseizure of their possessions as they do their persons. Even today,\na suspect driving a car loaded with illegal drugs may be more\ninterested in fleeing to avoid the loss of her valuable cargo than\nto prevent her own detention. Yet the majority offers no reasoned\nexplanation why the meaning of the word \u201cseizure\u201d changes when\nofficers hit the suspect and when they hit her drugs and car as all\nthree speed away.Unable to muster any precedent or sound reason\nfor its reading, the majority finishes its textual analysis with a\nselective snippet from Webster\u2019s Dictionary and a hypothetical\nabout a purse snatching. The majority notes that Webster equated a\nseizure with \u201c\u00a0\u2018the act of taking by warrant\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018laying hold on suddenly.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 4. But\nWebster used the warrant definition to describe \u201cthe seizure of\ncontraband goods\u201d\u2014a seizure the majorityagreesrequires\npossession. Meanwhile, the phrase \u201claying hold on\u201d a person\nconnotes physical possession, as a look at the dictionary\u2019s entire\ndefinition demonstrates. A \u201cseizure,\u201d Webster continued, is the\n\u201cact of taking possession by force,\u201d the \u201cact of taking by\nwarrant,\u201d \u201cpossession,\u201d and \u201ca catching.\u201d[2] Read in full, Webster thus lends no support to the\nmajority\u2019s view.The purse hypothetical, borrowed fromHodari\nD.\u2019s dicta, turns out to be even less illuminating. It supposes\nthat \u201can ordinary user of the English language could remark: \u2018She\nseized the purse-snatcher, but he broke out of her grasp.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 5 (quotingHodari D., 499 U.\u00a0S., at\n626). But what does that prove? The hypothetical contemplates a\nwoman whotakespossessionof the purse-snatcher,\nestablishing a \u201cgrasp\u201d for him to \u201cbreak out of.\u201d One doesn\u2019t\n\u201cbreak out of\u00a0\u201d a mere touch.Really, the majority\u2019s answer to the\nConstitution\u2019s text is to ignore it. The majority stands mute\nbefore the consensus among founding-era dictionaries, this Court\u2019s\nearly cases interpreting the word \u201cseizure,\u201d and the Warrant\nClause. It admits its interpretation spurns the canonical\ninterpretive principle that a single word in a legal text does not\nchange its meaning depending on what object it modifies. All we\u2019re\noffered is a curated snippet and an unhelpful hypothetical.\nUltimately, it\u2019s hard not to wonder whether the majority says so\nlittle about the Constitution\u2019s terms because so little can be said\nthat might support its ruling.BRather than focus on text, the majority turns\nquickly to history. At common law, it insists, a \u201clinkage\u201d existed\nbetween the \u201cseizure\u201d of a person and the concept of an \u201carrest.\u201dAnte, at 5. Thus, the majority contends, we must examine how\nthe common law definedthatterm. But following the majority\ndown this path only leads to another dead end. Unsurprisingly, an\n\u201carrest\u201d at common law ordinarily required possession too.1Consider what some of our usual common law\nguides say on the subject. Blackstone defined \u201can arrest\u201d in the\ncriminal context as \u201cthe apprehending or restraining of one\u2019s\nperson, in order to be forthcoming to answer an alleged or\nsuspected crime.\u201d 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 286 (1769).\nHale and Hawkins both equated an \u201carrest\u201d with \u201capprehending,\u201d\n\u201ctaking,\u201d and \u201cdetain[ing]\u201d a person. See 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the\nCrown 89, 93\u201394 (5th ed. 1716); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown\n74\u201375, 77, 80\u201381, 86 (3d ed. 1739). And Hawkins stated that an\narrest required the officer to \u201cactually have\u201d the suspect \u201cin his\nCustody.\u201dId., at 129. Any number of historical dictionaries\nattest to a similar understanding\u2014defining an \u201carrest\u201d as a \u201cstop,\u201d\na \u201ctaking of a person,\u201d and the act \u201cby which a man becomes a\nprisoner.\u201d[3]Common law causes of action point to the same\ncommon-sense conclusion. During the founding era, an individual who\nwas unlawfully arrested could seek redress through the tort of\nfalse imprisonment. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 127 (1768); see alsoPaytonv.New York,445 U.S.\n573, 592 (1980);Wallacev.Kato,549 U.S.\n384, 388\u2013389 (2007) (describing \u201cfalse arrest and false\nimprisonment\u201d as the \u201cclosest analogy\u201d to an arrest without\nprobable cause). That cause of action aimed to remedy \u201cthe\nviolation of the right of personal liberty,\u201d 3 Blackstone,supra, at 127, which was \u201cthe power of loco-motion, of\nchanging situation, or removing one\u2019s person to whatsoever place\none\u2019s own inclination may direct,\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 130 (1765). Thus, false imprisonment\u2014the\nviolation of the right to move where one desired\u2014required proof of\n\u201c[t]he detention of the person\u201d and \u201c[t]he unlawfulness of such\ndetention.\u201d 3 Blackstone,supra, at 127. That detention\ncould occur \u201cin a gaol, house, stocks, or in the street,\u201d but it\noccurred only if a person was \u201cunder the custodyof\nanother.\u201d 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 428 (1806) (emphasis\nadded).Much the same held true in another related\nfield. At common law, an officer could be held criminally liable\nfor allowing an individual to escape after being arrested. And to\nprove the existence of an arrest in an \u201cIndictment for an Escape,\u201d\na prosecutor had to \u201cexpressly shew\u201d that \u201cthe Party was actually\nin theDefendant\u2019s Custodyfor a Crime, Action, or\nCommitment for it.\u201d 2 Hawkins,supra, at 132 (emphasis\nadded). In other words, to demonstrate an arrest, a prosecutor had\nto prove the suspect had been \u201ca Prisonerin [the officer\u2019s]\nCustody.\u201d 1 Hale,supra, at 112 (emphasis added). Here,\ntoo, an arrest required possession.Once more, the majority\u2019s primary answer to all\nthis countervailing evidence is to ignore it. And once more, the\nmajority\u2019s own sources do more to hurt than help its cause. Lifting\na line fromSimpsonv.Hill, 1 Esp. 431, 170 Eng.\nRep. 409 (N.\u00a0P. 1795), the majority suggests that the tort of\nfalse imprisonment at common law required no more than a \u201ctapping\non the shoulder.\u201dAnte, at 13 (citing 1 Esp., at 431\u2013432,\n170 Eng. Rep., at 409). ButSimpsoncould not have stated\nthe possession requirement more plainly: \u201c[W]ithout anytaking\npossessionof the person,\u201d there \u201cis not, by law, a false\nimprisonment.\u201dId., at 432, 170 Eng. Rep., at 409 (emphasis\nadded). And the court proceeded torejectthe\nplaintiff\u00a0\u2019s claim for false imprisonment because the\n\u201cconstable did never take herinto custody.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). The majority offers no case finding the elements\nof false imprisonment satisfied by the mere touch of a fleeing\nperson.What remains of the majority\u2019s response follows\nthe same course. The majority asserts that claims for escape only\nrequired proof that the officer touched a suspect.Ante, at\n12. But to prove its point, the majority quotes a sentence from\nHale stating thatnoliability for escape exists \u201c\u00a0\u2018if\nthe felon were not once in the hands of an officer.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting 2 Pleas of the Crown 93 (1736)). And as Hale\nproceeded to make plain, a felon \u201cin the hands of an officer\u201d was\nanother way of saying the officer had \u201capprehended\u201d or \u201ctaken\u201d the\nfelon into his \u201ccustody.\u201d Seeid., at 89, 93\u201394 (5th ed.\n1716).Ultimately, the majority seeks to invoke Samuel\nJohnson\u2019s dictionary andPayton, 445 U.\u00a0S., at 585, to\nconfirm only the anodyne point that some sort of \u201clinkage\u201d existed\nat common law between the concepts of \u201carrests\u201d and \u201cseizures.\u201dAnte, at 5. Yet, even here it turns out there is more to the\nstory. The majority neglects to mention that Johnson proceeded to\ndefine an \u201carrest\u201d as a \u201ccaption\u201d of the person, \u201ca stop or stay,\u201d\na \u201crestraint of a man\u2019s person, depriving him of his own will,\u201d and\n\u201cthe beginning of imprisonment.\u201d 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (6th ed. 1785). \u201cTo arrest,\u201d Johnson said, was\n\u201c[t]o seize,\u201d \u201cto detain by power,\u201d \u201c[t]o withhold; to hinder,\u201d and\n\u201c[t]o stop motion.\u201dIbid.Meanwhile, the sentence fragment\nthe majority quotes fromPaytonturns out to have originated\nin Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence inUnited Statesv.Watson,423 U.S.\n411, 428 (1976). And looking to that sentence in full, it is\nplain Justice Powell, too, understood an arrest not as a touching,\nbut as \u201cthe taking hold of one\u2019s person.\u201dIbid.Thus, even\nthe majority\u2019s best sources only wind up pointing us back to the\ntraditional possession rule.2Unable to identify anything helpful in the\nmain current of the common law, the majority is forced to retreat\nto an obscure eddy. Starting fromHodari D.\u2019s three\nreferences to \u201cmere touch\u201d arrests, the majority traces these\nauthorities back to their English origins. The tale that unfolds is\na curious one.Before bankruptcy reforms in the 19th century,\ncreditors seeking to induce repayment of their loans could employ\nbailiffs to civilly arrest delinquent debtors and haul them off to\ndebtors prison. See Cohen, The History of Imprisonment for Debt and\nIts Relation to the Development of Discharge in Bankruptcy, 3 J.\nLegal Hist. 153, 154\u2013155 (1982). But the common law also offered\ndebtors some tools to avoid or delay that fate. Relevant here, the\ncommon law treated the home as a \u201ccastle of defence and asylum\u201d so\nno bailiff could break into a debtor\u2019s home to effect a civil\narrest. 3 Blackstone,supra, at 288; see also Treiman,\nEscaping the Creditor in the Middle Ages, 43 L.\u00a0Q. Rev. 230,\n233 (1927). Over time, the practice of \u201ckeeping house\u201d became an\nincreasingly popular way for debtors to evade the bailiff.Id., at 234. Naturally, too, creditors railed against this\n\u201cnotorious\u201d practice. Seeibid.And eventually Parliament\nresponded to their clamor. The English bankruptcy statutes of 1542\nand 1570 imposed serious penalties on debtors who \u201ckept house\u201d to\navoid imprisonment. Cohen,supra, at 157.It was seemingly against this backdrop that the\nstrange casesHodari D.\u2019s dicta briefly alluded to and the\nmajority has now dug up began to appear. Under their terms, a\nbailiff who could manage to touch a person hiding in his home,\noften through an open window or door, was deemed to have effected a\ncivil \u201carrest.\u201d SeeGennerv.Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 87\nEng. Rep. 928 (K. B. 1704). And because this mere touch was deemed\nan \u201carrest,\u201d the bailiff was then permitted by law to proceed to\n\u201cbr[eak] the house .\u00a0.\u00a0. to seize upon\u201d the person and\nrender him to prison.Ibid., 87 Eng. Rep., at 929. Of course\nit was farcical to call a tap through an open window an \u201carrest.\u201d\nBut it proved a useful farce, at least for creditors.One of the majority\u2019s lead cases,Sandonv.Jervis, El. Bl. & El. 935, 120 Eng. Rep. 758 (K. B.\n1858), illustrates the absurdity of it all. There, a bailiff tried\nand failed \u201con several occasions\u201d to arrest a debtor.Id.,\nat 936, 120 Eng. Rep., at 758. Eventually, the bailiff spotted an\nopen window on \u201can upper story,\u201d so he ordered an assistant to\nfetch a ladder.Ibid.But the debtor and his daughter\nnoticed the ploy and \u201cran to the window,\u201d slamming it closed.Ibid.Unfortunately, in the excitement a window pane broke.\nSeeing the opportunity, the bailiff\u00a0\u2019s assistant, while\nperched atop the ladder, thrust his hand through the opening and\nmanaged to touch the debtor.Id., at 936\u2013937, 120 Eng. Rep.,\nat 758. According to the court, this \u201carrest\u201d was sufficient to\njustify the bailiff\u00a0\u2019s later forcible entry into the home.Id., at 946\u2013948, 120 Eng. Rep., at 762\u2013763.By everyone\u2019s account, however, the farce\nextended only so far. Yes, the mere-touch arrest was a feature of\ncivil bankruptcy practice for an unfortunate period. But the\nmajority has not identified asinglefounding-era case\nextending the mere-touch arrest rule to the criminal context. The\nmajority points to two nineteenth-century treatises, but both\nreference only a case about a debt-collection arrest. Seeante, at 11\u201312 (citing 1 J. Backus, A Digest of Laws\nRelating to the Offices and Duties of Sheriff, Coroner and\nConstable 115\u2013116, n.\u00a0(c) (1812) (citingGennerv.Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 87 Eng. Rep. 928 (K. B. 1704)), and 1 R.\nBurn, The Justice of the Peace 275 (28th ed. 1837) (citing the\nsame)). The majority nods to dicta from an 1854 Delaware state\ntrial court, but that came long after the founding and the majority\ndoes not explain how it sheds light on the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\noriginal meaning. Seeante, at 12 (citingStatev.Townsend, 5 Del. 487, 488)). And every remaining early\nAmerican case the majority cites for its \u201cmere touch\u201d rule\u2014from the\nfounding through the Civil War\u2014involved only civil debt-collection\narrests. Seeante, at 4 (citingWhitheadv.Keyes, 85 Mass. 495 (1862));ante, at 6 (citingUnited Statesv.Benner, 24 F. Cas. 1084 (No. 14,568)\n(CC ED Pa. 1830));ante, at 6 (citingButlerv.Washburn, 25 N.\u00a0H. 251 (1852) (tax collection)). The\nsame goes for the majority\u2019s primary English authorities. Seeante, at 7 (citingNichollv.Darley, 2 Y.\n& J. 399, 400, 148 Eng. Rep. 974 (Exch. 1828);Sandon,\nEl. Bl. & El., at 940, 120 Eng. Rep., at 760)).So what relevance do these obscure and\nlong-abandoned civil debt-collection practices have for today\u2019s\ncase concerning a criminal arrest and brought under the Fourth\nAmendment? The answer seems to be not much, for at least three\nreasons.In the first place, the Amendment speaks of\n\u201cseizures,\u201d not \u201carrests.\u201d To the extent the common law of arrests\ninforms the Amendment\u2019s meaning, we have already seen that an\narrest normally meant taking possession of an arrestee. Maybe in\none peculiar area, and for less than admirable reasons, the common\nlaw deviated from this understanding. But this Court usually\npresumes that those who wrote the Constitution used words in their\nordinary sense, not in some idiosyncratic way. SeeDistrict of\nColumbiav.Heller,554 U.S.\n570, 576 (2008). And today\u2019s majority supplies no evidence that\nanyone during the founding era understood the Fourth Amendment to\nadopt the specialized definition of \u201carrest\u201d from civil\ndebt-collection practice.Second, even if we were to hypothesize that\npeopledidunderstand the Fourth Amendment to incorporate\nthis quirky rule, what would that tell us? Here, the officers tried\nto arrest Ms. Torres in a parking lot on behalf of the State for\nserious crimes, not break into her home on behalf of the local\ncredit union for missing a payment. So even if we were willing to\nsuppose that the founding generation understood the Constitution to\nincorporate the majority\u2019s civil debt-collection arrest rule,\nnothing before us suggests they contemplated, let alone endorsed,\ninjecting it into the criminal law and overriding settled doctrine\nequating arrests with possession.Finally, even in the civil debt-collection\ncontext, the majority cannot point to even a single case suggesting\nthat hitting a suspect with an object\u2014an arrow, a bullet, a cudgel,anything\u2014as she flees amounted to an arrest. Instead, the\nmajority\u2019s cases hold only that the \u201claying of hands\u201d on an\narrestee constituted an arrest.Ante, at 7. Thus, even if\nthe Fourth Amendment did transpose the \u201cmere touch\u201d rule from the\ncontext of civil arrests into the criminal arena, itstillwould not reach this case.How does the majority respond? Again, it does\nlittle more than disregard the difficulties. The majority says\nthere is \u201cno reason to suspect\u201d the common law defined criminal\narrests of felons \u201cany differently\u201d than civil arrests of debtors.Ante, at 13, 11. But the majority skips over all the\nevidence canvassed above showing that a criminal arrest required\npossession, not a mere touch. See Part III\u2013B\u20131,supra. It\nsails past its failure to identifyanycase holding that a\nmere touch qualified as a criminal arrest. It ignores the fact\nBlackstone defined criminal and civil arrests differently.[4] And it claims to find support in\nHawkins\u2019s statement that an officer could break into a house to\ncapture an arrestee who escaped after being \u201c\u00a0\u2018lawfully\narrested foranyCause.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 13\u201314\n(quoting 2 Pleas of the Crown 87 (1721)). Yet, the question before\nus isn\u2019t what an officer might doaftermaking an arrest;\nit\u2019s what constitutes an arrestin the first place.Rather than confront shortcomings like these,\nthe majority asks us to glide past them. It suggests that importing\nthe mere-touch rule into the criminal context is permissible\nbecause \u201cno common law case\u201d had occasion to reject that idea\nexpressly. Seeante, at 16. But this gets things backwards.\nToday, for the first time, the majority seeks to equate seizures\nand criminal arrests with mere touches, attempted seizures, and\nbatteries. It is forthe majorityto show the Fourth\nAmendment commands this result. No amount of rhetorical maneuvering\ncan obscure how flat it has fallen: Even its own authorities do\nmore to undermine than support its thesis. If common law courts\nnever contemplated the majority\u2019s odd definition of a criminal\narrest\u2014and this Court didn\u2019t either for more than two\ncenturies\u2014that can only be further proof of its implausibility.The majority asks us to glide past another\nproblem too. It acknowledges that its debt-collection cases\nrequired a \u201claying on of hands\u201d to complete an arrest. But it says\nwe should overlook that rule as an accident of antiquity.\n\u201cTouchings\u201d by \u201cfirearm,\u201d we are told, were unknown to\n\u201cfounding-era courts,\u201d and no \u201cofficer used a gun to apprehend a\nsuspect\u201d before 1850.Ante, at 9. Never mind the shot heard\nround the world in 1775 and the adoption of the Second Amendment.\nNever mind that as early as 1592, when a bailiff \u201cfeared\nresistance\u201d and thus \u201cbrought with him\u201d a gun \u201cto arrest\u201d someone,\na common law court deemed it lawful because \u201c[t]he sheriff or any\nof his ministers may for the better execution of justice carry with\nthem offensive or defensive weapons.\u201dSeint John\u2019s Case, 5\nCo. Rep. 71b, 77 Eng. Rep. 162, 162\u2013163 (K. B. 1592). Never mind\nthat even tax collectors were carrying guns by the 1680s.E.g.,Dickensonv.Watson, Jones, T. 205,\n205\u2013206, 84 Eng. Rep. 1218, 1218\u20131219 (K.\u00a0B. 1682). And never\nmind, too, that the majority\u2019s problem isn\u2019t limited to guns. It\nfails to cite any case in which a touching byanyweapon was\ndeemed sufficient to effect an arrest. Seemingly, the majority\nwould have us believe that bailiffs wielding anything but their\nfists were beyond the framers\u2019 imagination.Faced with all these problems, the majority\ntacks. It scrambles to locate a case\u2014any case\u2014suggesting that\ncommon law courts considered \u201ctouchings\u201d by weapon enough to effect\nan arrest in the debt-collection context. Ultimately, the majority\nasks us to dwell at length on the Countess of Rutland\u2019s case. In at\nleast that lone instance, the majority promises, we will find\nbailiffs who arrested a debtor by touching her with an object (a\nmace) rather than a laying on of hands. Seeante, at 7\u20138\n(citingCountess of Rutland\u2019s Case, 6 Co. Rep. 52b, 54a, 77\nEng. Rep. 332 (Star Chamber 1605)). But it turns out the dispute\nconcerned whether a countess could be civilly arrestedat\nall, not when or how the arrest was completed. The court had no\nreason to (and did not) decide whether the bailiffs accomplished\ntheir arrest when they \u201cshewed her their mace,\u201d \u201ctouch[ed]\u201d her\nwith the mace, or \u201ccompelled the coachman to carry\u201d her to jail.Id., at 54a, 77 Eng. Rep., at 336. And no one questions that\nthese things together\u2014a show of authority followed by compelled\ndetention\u2014have always been enough to complete an arrest. Not even\nminor royalty can rescue the majority.So the majority tacks again. Now it asks us to\ndispense with the common law\u2019s \u201claying on of hands\u201d requirement as\nan \u201cartificial\u201d rule.Ante, at 8. Distinguishing between\n\u201ctouchings\u201d by hand and by weapon, it says, \u201ccalls to mind the\nunavailing defense of the person who \u2018persistently denied that he\nhad laid hands upon a priest, for he had only cudgelled and kicked\nhim.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.But the quip exposes the majority\u2019s bind.\nTo get where it wishes to go, the majority not only must rework the\nrules found in the cases on which it relies, it must also abandon\ntheir rationale. The debt-collection cases treated the \u201claying on\nof hands\u201d as a sign ofpossession.[5] Maybe the possession was more \u201cconstructive\u201d or even\nfictional than \u201cactual.\u201d Seeante, at 16. But the idea was\nthat someone who stood next to a debtor and laid hands on him could\ntheoretically exercise a degree of control over his person. Common\nlaw courts never said the same of bailiffs who fired arrows at\ndebtors, shot them with firearms, or cudgeled them as they ran\naway. Such conduct might have amounted to abattery, but it\nwas never deemed sufficient to constitute anarrest.\nDoubtless that\u2019s why when a tax collector shot a man in the eye\nwith a (supposedly unavailable) firearm in 1682, the man sued the\nofficer for \u201cassault, battery, and wounding\u201d\u2014notfalse\nimprisonment. SeeDickenson, Jones, T., at 205, 84 Eng.\nRep., at 1218\u20131219.The majority implores us to study the common law\nhistory of arrests. But almost immediately, the majority realizes\nit cannot find what it seeks in the history of criminal arrests. So\nit is forced to disinter a long-abandoned mere-touch rule from\ncivil bankruptcy practice. Then it must import that rule into the\ncriminal law. And because even that isn\u2019t enough to do the work it\nwishes done, the majority must jettison both the laying on of hands\nrequirement and the rationale that sustained it. All of which\nleaves us confusing seizures with their attempts and arrests with\nbatteries.The common law offers a vast legal library. Like\nany other, it must be used thoughtfully. We have no business\nwandering about and randomly grabbing volumes off the shelf,\nplucking out passages we like, scratching out bits we don\u2019t, all\nbefore pasting our own new pastiche into the U.\u00a0S. Reports.\nThat does not respect legal history; it rewrites it.CIf text and history pose challenges for the\nmajority, so do this Court\u2019s precedents. The majority admits (as it\nmust) that the seizure of an object occurs only through taking\npossession.Ante, at 4. The majority also admits (as it\nmust) that the seizure of a person through a \u201cshow of authority\u201d\noccurs only if the suspect submits to an officer\u2019s possession.Ante, at 15. But the majority fails to acknowledge that this\nCourt hasalsosaid the same principle governs the seizure\nof persons effected through the use of force.InTerryv.Ohio,392 U.S. 1(1968), the Court explained that \u201c[o]nlywhen the officer,\nby means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way\nrestrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a\n\u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201dId., at 19, n.\u00a016 (emphasis\nadded). The restraint of libertyTerryreferred to was\n\u201cinterference\u201d with a person\u2019s \u201cfreedom of movement.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Jacobsen,466 U.S.\n109, 113, n.\u00a05 (1984). As the Court put it inBrowerv.County of Inyo,489\nU.S. 593(1989), a decision issued just two years beforeHodari D.: \u201cIt is clear, in other words, that a Fourth\nAmendment seizure\u201d occurs \u201conly when there is a governmental\ntermination of freedom of movement through means intentionally\napplied.\u201d 489 U.\u00a0S., at 597 (emphasis deleted).Rather than follow these teachings, the majority\ndisparages them. After highlighting (multiple times) that Justice\nScalia authoredHodari D.\u2019s dicta, the majority turns about\nand faults his opinion for the Court inBrowerfor\n\u201cimproperly eras[ing] the distinction between seizures bycontroland seizures byforce.\u201dAnte, at 14.\nThe majority continues on to blame other of our decisions, too, for\n\u201chav[ing] not always been attentive\u201d to this supposedly fundamental\ndistinction.Ibid. But this Court has not been\n\u201c[in]attentive\u201d to a fundamental Fourth Amendment distinction for\nover two centuries, let alone sought to \u201cerase\u201d it. In truth, the\nmajority\u2019s \u201cdistinction\u201d is a product of its own invention. This\nCourt has always recognized thathowseizures take place can\ndiffer. Some may take place after a show of authority, others by\nthe application of force, still others after a polite request. But\ntobea \u201cseizure,\u201d the same result has always been required:\nAn officer must acquire possession.IVIf text, history, and precedent cannot explain\ntoday\u2019s result, what can? The majority seems to offer a clue when\nit promises its new rule will help us \u201cavoi[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nline-drawing problems.\u201dAnte, at 15\u201316 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Any different standard, the majority worries, would\nbe \u201cdifficult to apply.\u201dAnte, at 15.But if efficiency in judicial administration is\nthe explanation, it is a troubling one. Surely our role as\ninterpreters of the Constitution isn\u2019t to make life easier for\nourselves. Cf. Calabresi & Lawson, The Rule of Law as a Law of\nLaw, 90 Notre Dame L.\u00a0Rev. 483, 488 (2014). Nor, for that\nmatter, has the majority even tried to show that the traditional\npossession rule\u2014in use \u201c[f]rom the time of the founding,\u201dHodari\nD., 499 U.\u00a0S., at 624\u2014has proven unreasonably difficult to\nadminister. Everyone agrees, too, that the possession rule will\ncontinue to govern when it comes to the seizures of objects and\npersons through a show of authority. So, rather than simplify\nthings, the majority\u2019s new rule for \u201cmere touch\u201d seizures promises\nonly to add another layer of complexity to the law.Even within its field of operation, the\nmajority\u2019s rule seems destined to underdeliver on its predicted\nefficiencies. The majority tells us that its new test requires an\n\u201cobjective intent to restrain.\u201dAnte, at 10. But what\nqualifies is far from clear. The majority assures us that a \u201ctap on\nthe shoulder to get one\u2019s attention will rarely exhibit such an\nintent.\u201dIbid.Suppose, though, the circumstances\n\u201cobjectively\u201d indicate that the tap was \u201cintended\u201d to secure a\nperson\u2019s attention for a minute, a quarter hour, or longer. Would\nthat be enough?Then there\u2019s the question what kind of\n\u201ctouching\u201d will suffice. Imagine that, with an objective intent to\ndetain a suspect, officers deploy pepper spray that enters a\nsuspect\u2019s lungs as he sprints away. Does the application of the\npepper spray count? Suppose that, intending to capture a fleeing\nsuspect, officers detonate flash-bang grenades that are so loud\nthey damage the suspect\u2019s eardrum, even though he manages to run\noff. Or imagine an officer shines a laser into a suspect\u2019s eyes to\nget him to stop, but the suspect is able to drive away with\nnow-damaged retinas. Are these \u201ctouchings\u201d? What about an officer\u2019s\nbullet that shatters the driver\u2019s windshield, a piece of which cuts\nher as she speeds away? Maybe the officer didn\u2019t touch the suspect,\nbut he set in motion a series of events that yielded a touching.\nDoes that count? While assuring us that its new rule will prove\neasy to administer, the majority refuses to confront its certain\ncomplications. Lower courts and law enforcement won\u2019t have that\nluxury.If efficiency cannot explain today\u2019s decision,\nwhat\u2019s left? Maybe it is an impulse that individuals like Ms.\nTorresshouldbe able to sue for damages. Sometimes police\nshootings are justified, but other times they cry out for a remedy.\nThe majority seems to give voice to this sentiment when it\ndisparages the traditional possession rule as \u201cartificial\u201d and\npromotes its alternative as more sensitive to \u201cpersonal security\u201d\nand \u201cnew\u201d policing realities.Ante, at 8\u20139. It takes pains\nto explain, too, that its new rule will provide greater protection\nfor personal \u201cprivacy\u201d interests, which we\u2019re told make up the\n\u201cessence\u201d of the Fourth Amendment.Ante, at 16 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).But tasked only with applying the Constitution\u2019s\nterms, we have no authority to posit penumbras of \u201cprivacy\u201d and\n\u201cpersonal security\u201d and devise whatever rules we think might best\nserve the Amendment\u2019s \u201cessence.\u201d The Fourth Amendment allows this\nCourt to protect against specific governmental actions\u2014unreasonable\nsearches and seizures of persons, houses, papers, and effects\u2014and\nthat is the limit of our license. Besides, it\u2019s hard to see why we\nshould stretch to invent a new remedy here. Ms. Torres had\nready-made claims for assault and battery under New Mexico law to\ntest the officers\u2019 actions. See N.\u00a0M. Stat. Ann \u00a741\u20134\u201312\n(2020). The only reason this case comes before us under \u00a71983 and\nthe Fourth Amendment rather than before a New Mexico court under\nstate tort law seems to be that Ms. Torres (or her lawyers) missed\nthe State\u2019s two-year statutory filing deadline. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 16\u201317; Brief for Respondents 20, n.\u00a04. That may be a\nmisfortune for her, but it is hardly a reason to upend a 230\nyear-old understanding of our Constitution.Nor, if we are honest, does today\u2019s decision\npromise much help to anyone else. Like Ms. Torres, many seeking to\nsue officers will be able to bring state tort claims. Even for\nthose whose only recourse is a federal lawsuit, the majority\u2019s new\nrule seems likely to accomplish little. This Court has already said\nthat a remedy lies under \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth Amendment for\npolice conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201dCounty of\nSacramentov.Lewis,523 U.S.\n833, 840, 845\u2013847 (1998). At the same time, qualified immunity\nposes a daunting hurdle for those seeking to recover for less\negregious police behavior. In our own case, Ms. Torres has yet to\nclear that bar and still faces it on remand. So, at the end of it\nall, the majority\u2019s new rule will help only those who (1) lack a\nstate-law remedy, (2) evade custody, (3) after some physical\ncontact by the police, (4) where the contact was sufficient to show\nan objective intent to restrain, (5) and where the police acted\n\u201cunreasonably\u201d in light of clearly established law, (6) but the\npolice conduct wasnot\u201cconscience shocking.\u201d With\nqualification heaped on qualification, that can describe only a\nvanishingly small number of cases.Even if its holding offers little practical\nassistance to anyone, perhaps the majority at least hopes to be\nseen as trying to vindicate \u201cpersonal security\u201d and the \u201cessence\u201d\nof \u201cprivacy\u201d when it derides the traditional possession rule as\n\u201cartificial.\u201d But an attractive narrative cannot obscure the hard\ntruth. Not only does the majority\u2019s \u201cmere touch\u201d rule allow a new\ncause of action in exceedingly few cases\n(non-conscience-shocking-but-still-unreasonable batteries intended\nto result in possession that don\u2019t achieve it). It supplies no path\nto relief for otherwise identical near-misses (assaults). A fleeing\nsuspect briefly touched by pursuing officers may have a claim. But\na suspect who evades a hail of bullets unscathed, or one who\nendures a series of flash-bang grenades untouched, is out of luck.\nThat distinction is no less \u201cartificial\u201d than the one the law has\nrecognized for centuries. And the majority\u2019s new rule promises such\nscarce relief that it can hardly claim more sensitivity to\n\u201cpersonal security\u201d than the rule the Constitution has long\nenshrined.In the face of these concerns, the majority\nreplies by denying their relevance. It says there is \u201cno call\u201d to\n\u201csurmise\u201d that its decision rests on anything beyond an \u201canalysis\nof the common law of arrest.\u201dAnte, at 17. But there is no\nsurmise about it. The majority itself tells us that its decision isalsojustified by the need to \u201cavoi[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nline-drawing problems,\u201d protect \u201cpersonal security,\u201d and advance\nthe \u201cprivacy\u201d interests that form the \u201cessence\u201d of the Fourth\nAmendment. Having invoked these sundry considerations, it\u2019s hard to\nsee how the majority might disown them.*To rule as it does, the majority must endow\nthe term \u201cseizure\u201d with two different meanings at the same time. It\nmust disregard the dominant rule of the common law. It must\ndisparage this Court\u2019s existing case law for erasing distinctions\nthat never existed. It cannot even guarantee that its new rule will\noffer great efficiencies or meaningfully vindicate the penumbral\npromises it supposes. Instead, we are asked to skip from one\nsnippet to another, finally landing on a long-abandoned\ndebt-collection practice that must be reengineered to do the work\nthe majority wishes done. Our final destination confuses a battery\nfor a seizure and an attempted seizure with its completion. All\nthis is miles from where the standard principles of interpretation\nlead and just as far from the Constitution\u2019s original meaning. And\nfor what? A new rule that may seem tempting at first blush, but\nthat offers those like Ms. Torres little more than false hope in\nthe end.Respectfully, I dissent.Notes1N.

But flipping from Blackstone\u2019s third volume\n(discussing \u201cprivate wrongs\u201d) to his fourth volume (discussing\n\u201cpublic wrongs\u201d) reveals\u2014as we have already seen but the majority\nfails to acknowledge\u2014that Blackstone equated a criminal arrest with\n\u201capprehending or restraining .\u00a0.\u00a0. one\u2019s person, in order\nto be forthcoming to answer an alleged or suspected crime.\u201d Seesupra, at 11.5That is why the\nmere-touch cases often discussed the \u201ccorporal possession of the\ndebtor.\u201dE.g.,Sandonv.Jervis, El.
