Not so today. Today, the\nCourt holds that reporting and disclosure requirements must be\nnarrowly tailored even if a plaintiff demonstrates no burden at\nall. The same scrutiny the Court applied when NAACP members in the\nJim Crow South did not want to disclose their membership for fear\nof reprisals and violence now applies equally in the case of donors\nonly too happy to publicize their names across the websites and\nwalls of the organizations they support.California oversees nearly a quarter of this\nNation\u2019s charitable assets. As part of that oversight, it\ninvestigates and prosecutes charitable fraud, relying in part on a\nregistry where it collects and keeps charitable organizations\u2019 tax\nforms. The majority holds that a California regulation requiring\ncharitable organizations to disclose tax forms containing the names\nand contributions of their top donors unconstitutionally burdens\nthe right to associate even if the forms are not publicly\ndisclosed.In so holding, the Court discards its\ndecades-long requirement that, to establish a cognizable burden on\ntheir associational rights, plaintiffs must plead and prove that\ndisclosure will likely expose them to objective harms, such as\nthreats, harassment, or reprisals. It also departs from the\ntraditional, nuanced approach to First Amendment challenges,\nwhereby the degree of means-end tailoring required is commensurate\nto the actual burdens on associational rights. Finally, it\nrecklessly holds a state regulation facially invalid despite\npetitioners\u2019 failure to show that a substantial proportion of those\naffected would prefer anonymity, much less that they are\nobjectively burdened by the loss of it.Today\u2019s analysis marks reporting and disclosure\nrequirements with a bull\u2019s-eye. Regulated entities who wish to\navoid their obligations can do so by vaguely waving toward First\nAmendment \u201cprivacy concerns.\u201dAnte,at 17. It does not\nmatter if not a single individual risks experiencing a single\nreprisal from disclosure, or if the vast majority of those affected\nwould happily comply. That is all irrelevant to the Court\u2019s\ndetermination that California\u2019s Schedule B requirement is facially\nunconstitutional. Neither precedent nor common sense supports such\na result. I respectfully dissent.ICharitable organizations that wish to solicit\ntax-deductible contributions from California residents must\nmaintain membership in a registry managed by the California\nattorney general. Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712584, 12585 (West 2018).\nAs a condition of membership, the attorney general requires\ncharities to submit a complete copy of Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) Form 990, including Schedule B, on which 501(c)(3)\norganizations report the names and contributions of their major\ndonors. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11, \u00a7301 (2021); 26 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71.6033\u20132(a)(2)(ii), (iii) (2020). California regulations\nexpressly require that Schedule Bs remain confidential, Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 11, \u00a7310(b), and the attorney general\u2019s office has\nimplemented enhanced protocols to ensure confidentiality.[1] California relies on Schedule Bs to\ninvestigate fraud and other malfeasance.After the attorney general\u2019s office stepped up\nits efforts to enforce California\u2019s Schedule B reporting\nrequirement, petitioners Americans for Prosperity Foundation\n(Foundation) and Thomas More Law Center (Law Center) sought an\ninjunction against the requirement. They alleged that the\nrequirement \u201cunconstitutionally burden[ed] their First Amendment\nright to free association by deterring individuals from financially\nsupporting them.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity Foundationv.Becerra, 903 F.3d 1000, 1006 (CA9 2018). They pointed to\nevidence that their supporters experienced threats, reprisals, and\nharassment when their identities and associations became publicly\nknown in other contexts. Importantly, however, the Foundation and\nLaw Center failed to show that such consequences would result from\nthe confidential submission of their top donors\u2019 identities to\nCalifornia\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office in light of the security\nmechanisms the office has now implemented.IIBecause the freedom to associate needs\n\u201cbreathing space to survive,\u201dNAACPv.Button,371\nU.S. 415, 433 (1963), this Court has recognized that\nassociational rights must be \u201cprotected not only against\nheavy-handed frontal attack, but also from being stifled by more\nsubtle governmental interference,\u201dBatesv.Little\nRock,361 U.S.\n516, 523 (1960). Publicizing individuals\u2019 association with\nparticular groups might expose members to harassment, threats, and\nreprisals by opponents of those organizations. Individuals may\nchoose to disassociate themselves from a group altogether rather\nthan face such backlash.Acknowledging that risk, this Court has observed\nthat \u201cprivacy in group association may in many circumstances be\nindispensable to preservation of freedom of association,\nparticularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.\u201dNAACPv.Alabama ex rel. Patterson,357 U.S.\n449, 462 (1958). That observation places special emphasis on\nthe risks actually resulting from disclosure. Privacy \u201cmay\u201d be\nindispensable to the preservation of freedom of association, but it\nneed not be. It depends on whether publicity will lead to reprisal.\nFor example, privacy can be particularly important to \u201cdissident\u201d\ngroups because the risk of retaliation against their supporters may\nbe greater. For groups that promote mainstream goals and ideas, on\nthe other hand, privacy may not be all that important. Not only\nmight their supporters feel agnostic about disclosing their\nassociation, they might actively seek to do so.Given the indeterminacy of how disclosure\nrequirements will impact associational rights, this Court requires\nplaintiffs to demonstrate that a requirement is likely to expose\ntheir supporters to concrete repercussions in order to establish an\nactual burden. It then applies a level of means-end tailoring\nproportional to that burden. The Court abandons that approach here,\ninstead holding that narrow tailoring applies to disclosure\nrequirements across the board, even if there is no evidence that\nthey burden anyone at all.ABefore today, to demonstrate that a reporting\nor disclosure requirement would chill association, litigants had to\nshow \u201ca reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. contributors\u2019 names will subject them to threats,\nharassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or\nprivate parties.\u201dBuckleyv.Valeo,424 U.S.\n1, 74 (1976) (per curiam). Proof could include \u201cspecific\nevidence of past or present harassment of members due to their\nassociational ties, or of harassment directed against the\norganization itself,\u201dibid., as well as evidence that \u201cfear\nof community hostility and economic reprisals that would follow\npublic disclosure .\u00a0.\u00a0. had discouraged new members from\njoining\u201d an organization or caused \u201cformer members to withdraw,\u201dBates, 361 U.\u00a0S., at 524. Although the Court has never\nimposed an \u201cunduly strict requiremen[t] of proof,\u201dBuckley,\n424 U.\u00a0S., at 74, it has consistently required at least some\nrecord evidence demonstrating a risk of such objective harms. SeeBates, 361 U.\u00a0S., at 523\u2013524;Patterson, 357\nU.\u00a0S., at 462\u2013463.Indeed, the Court has expressly held that\nparties do not have standing to bring claims where they assert\nnothing more than that government action will cause a \u201csubjective\n\u2018chill.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLairdv.Tatum,408 U.S.\n1, 13\u201314 (1972). It does not matter if an individual perceives\na government regulation \u201cas inappropriate,\u201d or believes \u201cit is\ninherently dangerous for the [government] to be concerned with\u201d a\nparticular activity, or has \u201cgeneralized yet speculative\napprehensiveness that the [government] may at some future date\nmisuse the information in some way that would cause direct harm\u201d to\nher.Id.,at 13. She must still allege a risk of objective\nharm. Seeid.,at 14; see alsoClapperv.Amnesty\nInt\u2019l USA,568 U.S.\n398, 417\u2013418 (2013).Consistent with this approach, the Court has\ncarefully scrutinized record evidence to determine whether a\ndisclosure requirement actually risks exposing supporters to\nbacklash. SeePatterson, 357 U.\u00a0S., at 462 (compelled\ndisclosure of NAACP members \u201centail[ed] the likelihood of a\nsubstantial restraint\u201d on association in light of \u201can\nuncontroverted showing\u201d that past disclosures exposed members \u201cto\neconomic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion,\nand other manifestations of public hostility\u201d);Bates, 361\nU.\u00a0S., at 523\u2013524 (compelled disclosure of NAACP membership\n\u201cwould work a significant interference with the freedom of\nassociation\u201d based on \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d that past\nidentification \u201chad been followed by harassment and threats of\nbodily harm\u201d);Sheltonv.Tucker,364 U.S.\n479, 486 (1960) (disclosure of teachers\u2019 organizational\naffiliations impaired association because record evidence\nsubstantiated a \u201cfear of public disclosure\u201d and a \u201cconstant and\nheavy\u201d pressure on teachers \u201cto avoid any ties which might\ndisplease those who control [their] professional destin[ies]\u201d);Buckley, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 69\u201370 (\u201cany serious\ninfringement\u201d on associational rights caused by the compelled\ndisclosure of contributors was \u201chighly speculative\u201d on the record\nbefore the Court).Hence, inDoev.Reed,561 U.S.\n186(2010), the Court rejected a facial challenge to the public\ndisclosure of referenda signatories on the ground that the \u201ctypical\nreferendum\u201d concerned revenue, budget, and tax policies unlikely to\nincite threats or harassment.Id., at 200\u2013201. Any judge who\nhas witnessed local fights over raising taxes, funding schools,\nbuilding sewer systems, or rerouting roads can surely envisage\nsignatories with reason to keep their support for such measures\nprivate. But inReed, such subjective reasons did not\nsuffice to establish a cognizable burden on associational\nrights.Today, the Court abandons the requirement that\nplain-tiffs demonstrate that they are chilled, much less that they\nare reasonably chilled. Instead, it presumes (contrary to the\nevidence, precedent, and common sense) that all disclosure\nrequirements impose associational burdens. For example, the Court\nexplains that there is a risk of chill in this suit because the\ngovernment requires disclosure of the identity of any donor \u201cwith\nreason to remain anonymous.\u201dAnte, at 17. The Court does not\nqualify that statement, nor does it require record evidence of such\nreasons. If the Court did, it would not be able to strike\nCalifornia\u2019s Schedule B requirement down in all its applications,\nbecause the only evidence in the record of donors with any reason\nto remain anonymous is that of petitioners\u2019.[2]At best, then, a subjective preference for\nprivacy, which previously did not confer standing, now subjects\ndisclosure requirements to close scrutiny. Of course, all\ndisclosure requires some loss of anonymity, and courts can always\nimagine that someone might, for some reason, prefer to keep their\ndonations undisclosed. If such speculation is enough (and\napparently it is), then all disclosure requirementsipso\nfactoimpose cognizable First Amendment burdens.Indeed, the Court makes obvious its presumption\nthat all disclosure requirements are burdensome by beginning its\nanalysis of \u201cburden\u201d with an evaluation of means-end fit instead.\n\u201c[A] reasonable assessment of the burdens imposed by disclosure,\u201d\nthe Court explains, \u201cshould begin with an understanding of the\nextent to which the burdens are unnecessary, and that requires\nnarrow tailoring.\u201dAnte, at 11; see alsoante, at\n17\u201318 (excusing plaintiffs from showing any burden if a disclosure\nlaw is not narrowly tailored).I disagree. A reasonable assessment of the\nburdens imposed by disclosure should begin by determining whether\nthose burdens even exist. If a disclosure requirement imposes no\nburdens at all, then of course there are no \u201cunnecessary\u201d burdens.\nLikewise, if a disclosure requirement imposes no burden for the\nCourt to remedy, there is no need for it to be closely scrutinized.\nBy forgoing the requirement that plaintiffs adduce evidence of\ntangible burdens, such as increased vulnerability to harassment or\nreprisals, the Court gives itself license to substitute its own\npolicy preferences for those of politically accountable actors.BAll this would be less troubling if the Court\nstill required means-end tailoring commensurate to the actual\nburden imposed. It does not. Instead, it adopts a new rule that\nevery reporting or disclosure requirement be narrowly tailored. Seeante, at 9 (\u201cWhile exacting scrutiny does not require that\ndisclosure regimes be the least restrictive means of achieving\ntheir ends, it does require that they be narrowly tailored to the\ngovernment\u2019s asserted interest\u201d).1Disclosure requirements burden associational\nrights only indirectly and only in certain contexts. For that\nreason, this Court has never necessarily demanded such requirements\nto be narrowly tailored. Rather, it has reserved such automatic\ntailoring for state action that \u201cdirectly and immediately affects\nassociational rights.\u201dBoy Scouts of Americav.Dale,530 U.S.\n640, 659 (2000); see alsoBuckley, 424 U.\u00a0S., at\n22, 25 (requiring a \u201cclosely drawn\u201d fit for political contribution\nlimits, which directly \u201climit one important means of associating\nwith a candidate or committee\u201d). When it comes to reporting and\ndisclosure requirements, the Court has instead employed a more\nflexible approach, which it has named \u201cexacting scrutiny.\u201d Seeante, at 7\u20138 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).Exacting scrutiny requires two things: first,\nthere must be \u201c\u00a0\u2018a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between the\ndisclosure requirement and a \u201csufficiently important\u201d government\ninterest,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and second, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the strength of the\ngovernmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual\nburden on First Amendment rights.\u2019\u00a0\u201dReed, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 196. Exacting scrutiny thus incorporates a degree of\nflexibility into the means-end analysis. The more serious the\nburden on First Amendment rights, the more compelling the\ngovernment\u2019s interest must be, and the tighter must be the fit\nbetween that interest and the government\u2019s means of pursuing it. By\ncontrast, a less substantial interest and looser fit will suffice\nwhere the burden on First Amendment rights is weaker (or\nnonexistent). In other words, to decide how closely tailored a\ndisclosure requirement must be, courts must ask an antecedent\nquestion: How much does the disclosure requirement actually burden\nthe freedom to associate?This approach reflects the longstanding\nprinciple that the requisite level of scrutiny should be\ncommensurate to the burden a government action actually imposes on\nFirst Amendment rights. See,e.g.,Burdickv.Takushi,504 U.S.\n428, 434 (1992) (\u201c[T]he rigorousness of our inquiry\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. depends upon the extent to which a challenged\nregulation burdens\u201d First Amendment rights);Board of Trustees\nof State Univ. of N. Y.v.Fox,492\nU.S. 469, 477 (1989) (\u201c[C]ommercial speech enjoys a limited\nmeasure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position\nin the scale of First Amendment values, and is [thus] subject to\nmodes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of\nnoncommercial expression\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted)); see alsoFultonv.Philadelphia, 593\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2021) (Barrett, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n2) (noting the \u201cnuanced\u201d approach the Court generally takes in the\n\u201cresolution of conflicts between generally applicable laws and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. First Amendment rights\u201d).Compare, for instance, the Court\u2019s approaches inSheltonv.TuckerandDoev.Reed. At\nissue inSheltonwas an Arkansas statute passed in 1958 that\ncompelled all public school teachers, as a condition of employment,\nto submit annually a list of every organization to which they\nbelonged or regularly contributed. 364 U.\u00a0S., at 480\u2013481. The\nCourt held that the disclosure requirement \u201ccomprehensive[ly]\ninterfere[d] with associational freedom,\u201d because record evidence\ndemonstrated a significant risk that the information would be\npublicly disclosed, and such disclosure could lead to public\npressure on school boards \u201cto discharge teachers who belong to\nunpopular or minority organizations.\u201dId.,at 486\u2013487, 490.\nArkansas\u2019s statute did not require that the information remain\nconfidential; each school board was \u201cfree to deal with the\ninformation as it wishe[d].\u201dId.,at 486. Indeed, \u201ca witness\nwho was a member of the Capital Citizens[\u2019] Council\u201d (an\norganization dedicated to resisting school integration)[3] \u201ctestified that his group intended\nto gain access\u201d to the teachers\u2019 affidavits \u201cwith a view to\neliminating from the school system persons who supported\norganizations unpopular with the group.\u201dIbid., n.\u00a07.\nMoreover, a starkly asymmetric power dynamic existed between\nteachers, who were \u201chired on a year-to-year basis,\u201d and the hiring\nauthorities to whom their membership lists were submitted.Id.,at 482. The Arkansas Legislature had made no secret of\nits desire for teachers\u2019 disclosures to be used for hiring and\nfiring decisions. One year after enacting the disclosure\nrequirement at issue inShelton, the legislature enacted\nanother provision that made it outright unlawful for state\ngovernmental bodies to employ members of the NAACP.Sheltonv.McKinley,174 F. Supp. 351, 353\u2013354 (ED Ark. 1959). It is thus\nunsurprising that the Court found that Arkansas teachers would feel\na \u201cconstant and heavy\u201d pressure \u201cto avoid any ties which might\ndisplease those who control [their] professional destin[ies].\u201dId.,at 486; see alsoKeyishianv.Board of\nRegents of Univ. of State of N. Y.,385\nU.S. 589, 604 (1967) (\u201cWhen one must guess what conduct or\nutterance may lose him his position, one necessarily will steer far\nwider of the [impermissible] zone\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Because Arkansas\u2019s purpose (ensuring teachers\u2019 fitness)\nwas \u201cpursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal\nliberties,\u201d the Court demanded that Arkansas \u201cmore narrowly\nachiev[e]\u201d its interest.Shelton, 364 U.\u00a0S., at\n488.Now consider this Court\u2019s approach inReed.Reedinvolved a facial challenge to a\nWashington law permitting the public disclosure of referendum\npetitions that included signatories\u2019 names and addresses. 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 190\u2013191. The Court found that Washington had a\nnumber of other mechanisms in place to pursue its stated interest\nin preventing fraudulent referendum signatures. For instance, the\nsecretary of state was charged with verifying and canvassing the\nnames on referendum petitions, advocates and opponents of a measure\ncould observe the canvassing process, and citizens could challenge\nthe secretary\u2019s actions in court.Id.,at 198. Publicly\ndisclosing referendum signatories was thus a mere backstop, giving\ncitizens the opportunity to catch the secretary\u2019s mistakes. Had\nWashington been required to achieve its interests narrowly, as inShelton, it is unlikely the disclosure requirement would\nhave survived.[4]In crucial contrast toShelton, however,\ntheReedCourt found \u201cscant evidence\u201d that disclosure\nexposed signatories of typical referendums to \u201cthreats, harassment,\nor reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\u201d\n561 U.\u00a0S., at 200\u2013201 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nGiven the \u201cmodest burdens\u201d imposed by the requirement,id.,at 201, the Court required a correspondingly modest level of\ntailoring. Under that standard, the disclosure requirement passed\nmuster, and the Court refused to facially strike it down.The public disclosure regimes in bothSheltonandReedserved important government goals.\nYet the Court\u2019s assessment of each differed considerably because\nthe First Amendment burdens differed. This flexible approach is\nnecessary because not all reporting and disclosure regimes burden\nassociational rights in the same way.2The Court now departs from this nuanced\napproach in favor of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d test. Regardless of\nwhether there is any risk of public disclosure, and no matter if\nthe burdens on associational rights are slight, heavy, or\nnonexistent, disclosure regimes must always be narrowly\ntailored.The Court searches in vain to find a foothold\nfor this new approach in precedent. The Court first seizes onShelton\u2019s statement that a governmental interest\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental\npersonal liberties when the end can be more narrowly\nachieved.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 9 (quoting 364 U.\u00a0S., at\n488). The Court could not havecherry-picked a less helpful quote. By its own\nterms,Sheltonheld that an end must be \u201cmore narrowly\nachieved\u201d only if the means \u201cbroadly stifle\u201d First Amendment\nliberties, that is, only if the means impose a severe burden on\nassociational rights.[5]In any event, the Court need not read a few\nisolated sentences from that opinion to divineShelton\u2019s\nmeaning. As described, see Part II\u2013B\u20131,supra, the Court inSheltonconcluded that a reasonable \u201cfear of public\ndisclosure\u201d and an asymmetric power dynamic with hiring authorities\nwould result in a \u201cconstant and heavy\u201d pressure on teachers \u201cto\navoid any ties which might displease those who control [their]\nprofessional destin[ies].\u201d 364 U.\u00a0S., at 486. Recall that a\nwitness had testified that his white supremacist organization would\nseek to obtain the identities of teachers working on civil rights\nissues in order to eradicate them from the school system, and that\njust a year after Arkansas enacted its disclosure law, it enacted a\nlaw prohibiting the hiring of members of the NAACP as public school\nteachers. The problem was not the breadth of the inquiry; it was\nthe significant risk that teachers would face serious repercussions\nfor their disclosed associations.[6]The Court next looks toMcCutcheonv.Federal Election Comm\u2019n,572 U.S.\n185(2014), which addressed political contribution limits, not\ndisclosure regimes. It is no surprise that the Court subjected the\nformer to narrow tailoring, asBuckleyhad already held that\ncontribution limits directly \u201cimpinge on protected associational\nfreedoms.\u201d 424 U.\u00a0S., at 22; see alsoMcCutcheon, 572\nU.\u00a0S., at 204 (explaining that aggregate limits on\ncontributions \u201cdiminish an individual\u2019s right of political\nassociation\u201d by \u201climit[ing] the number of candidates he supports\u201d\nor the amount of money he gives).Buckleyitself\ndistinguished the First Amendment burdens of disclosure\nrequirements and contribution limits. See 424 U.\u00a0S., at 64\n(noting that, unlike contribution limits, \u201cdisclosure requirements\nimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities\u201d and concluding\nonly that compelled disclosure \u201ccan\u201d infringe associational\nrights). Apparently, those distinctions no longer matter.NeitherSheltonnorMcCutcheon,\nthen, supports the idea that all disclosure requirements must be\nnarrowly tailored.McCutcheonarose in the context of a\ndirect limit on associational freedoms, while the law inShelton\u201cbroadly stifle[d]\u201d associational rights. Ignoring\nthese distinctions, the Court decides that it will indiscriminately\nrequire narrow tailoring for every single disclosure regime. The\nCourt thus trades precision for blunt force, creating a significant\nrisk that it will topple disclosure regimes that should be\nconstitutional, and that, as inReed, promote important\ngovernmental interests.IIIAUnder a First Amendment analysis that is\nfaithful to this Court\u2019s precedents, California\u2019s Schedule B\nrequirement is constitutional. Begin with the burden it imposes on\nassociational rights. Petitioners have unquestionably provided\nevidence that their donors face a reasonable probability of\nthreats, harassment, and reprisals if their affiliations are made\npublic. Seeante, at 4. California\u2019s Schedule B regulation,\nhowever, is a nonpublic reporting requirement, and California has\nimplemented security measures to ensure that Schedule B information\nremains confidential.[7]Nor have petitioners shown that their donors, or\nany organization\u2019s donors, will face threats, harassment, or\nreprisals if their names remain in the hands of a few California\nstate officials. The Court notes that, underShelton,\ndisclosure requirements can chill association even absent public\ndisclosure. Seeante,at 16. InShelton, however,\nthere was a serious concern that hiring authorities would punish\nteachers for their organizational affiliations. See 364 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 486. By contrast, the Court in no way suggests that California\nofficials will use Schedule B information to retaliate against any\norganization\u2019s donors. If California\u2019s reporting requirement\nimposes any burden at all, it is at most a very slight one.B1Given the modesty of the First Amendment\nburden, California may justify its Schedule B requirement with a\ncorrespondingly modest showing that the means achieve its ends. SeeReed, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 201. California easily meets this\nstandard.California collects Schedule Bs to facilitate\nsupervision of charities that operate in the State. As the Court\nacknowledges, this is undoubtedly a significant governmental\ninterest. Seeante,at 12\u201313. In the United States,\nresponsibility for overseeing charities has historically been\nvested in States\u2019 attorneys general, who are tasked with\nprosecuting charitable fraud, self-dealing, and misappropriation of\ncharitable funds. Effective policing is critical to maintaining\npublic confidence in, and continued giving to, charitable\norganizations. California\u2019s interest in exercising such oversight\nis especially compelling given the size of its charitable sector.\nNearly a quarter of the country\u2019s charitable assets are held by\ncharities registered in California. Brief for Scholars of the Law\nof Non-Profit Organizations asAmici Curiae10; seeibid.(\u201cAs of June 2018, charities registered in California\nreported $295 billion in annual income and net assets of $851\nbillion\u201d).The Schedule B reporting requirement is properly\ntailored to further California\u2019s efforts to police charitable\nfraud. SeeReed, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 198\u2013199 (noting that\ndisclosure \u201chelps\u201d combat fraud, even if it is not the least\nrestrictive method of doing so). The IRS Schedule B form requires\norganizations to disclose the names and addresses of their major\ndonors, the total amount of their contributions, and whether the\ndonation was cash or in-kind. See 26 CFR \u00a7\u00a71.6033\u20132(a)(2)(ii),\n(iii). If the gift is in-kind, Schedule B requires a description of\nthe property and its fair market value.Schedule B and other parts of Form 990 help\nattorneys in the Charitable Trusts Section of the California\nDepartment of Justice (Section) uncover whether an officer or\ndirector of a charity is engaged in self-dealing, or whether a\ncharity has diverted donors\u2019 charitable contributions for improper\nuse. Appellant-Cross-Appellee\u2019s Excerpts of Record in No. 16\u201355727\netc. (CA9), pp. 575, 716\u2013718 (16\u201355727 ER). It helps them determine\nwhether a donor is using the charity as a pass-through entity,\nincluding as a source of improper loans that the donor repays as a\ncontribution.Id.,at 577\u2013578, 716\u2013718. It helps them\nidentify red flags, such as discrepancies in reporting\ncontributions across different schedules.Id.,at 578\u2013579,\n716\u2013718. And it helps them determine whether a charity has inflated\nthe value of a donor\u2019s in-kind contribution in order, for instance,\nto overstate how efficiently the charity expends resources.Id.,at 721\u2013727.As a former head of the Section described it,\nSchedule B combined with the rest of Form 990 provides \u201c[a] roadmap\nto the rest of the investigation that follows.\u201dId., at 717.\nIndeed, having Schedule Bs on hand is important to attorneys\u2019\ndecisions regarding whether to advance an investigation at all. One\nof the first things an auditor or lawyer does upon receiving a\ncomplaint is review the entire Form 990, including Schedule B.Id.,at 969\u2013970, 996\u2013997, 1062\u20131063. One Section leader\ntestified that she used Schedule Bs \u201c[a]ll the time\u201d for this\npurpose. App. in No. 19\u2013251, p. 413.In sum, the evidence shows that California\u2019s\nconfidential reporting requirement imposes trivial burdens on\npetitioners\u2019 associational rights and plays a meaningful role in\nSection attorneys\u2019 ability to identify and prosecute charities\nengaged in malfeasance. That is more than enough to satisfy the\nFirst Amendment here.2Much of the Court\u2019s tailoring analysis is\ncategorically inappropriate under the correct standard of review.\nIn any event, the Court greatly understates the importance to\nCalifornia of collecting information on charitable organizations\u2019\ntop donors.The Court claims that the collection of Schedule\nBs does not form an \u201cintegral\u201d part of California\u2019s fraud detection\nefforts and has never done \u201c\u00a0\u2018anything\u2019\u00a0\u201d to advance\ninvestigative efforts.[8]Ante,at 13. The record reveals otherwise. As discussed,\nSection leaders report that they use Schedule Bs \u201c[a]ll the time\u201d\nand rely on them to create roadmaps for their investigations. App.\nin No. 19\u2013251, at 413; see also 16\u201355727 ER, at 717. The Court\nfurther complains that California does not rely on Schedule Bs to\n\u201cinitiate\u201d investigations.Ante,at 15, 19. But disclosure\nassists California in its decisions whether to advance or end an\ninvestigation. Perhaps the Court\u2019s main concern is that California\nhas not identified enough instances in which Schedule B played a\nunique role in prosecuting charitable malfeasance. But \u201c[l]ike a\njigsaw puzzle,\u201d investigations often advance \u201conly by placing in\nthe proper place the many pieces of evidence that, taken singly,\nwould show comparatively little.\u201dAndresenv.Maryland,427 U.S.\n463, 481, n.\u00a010 (1976).The Court next insists that California can rely\non alternative mechanisms, such as audit letters or subpoenas, to\nobtain Schedule B information. But the Section receives as many as\n100 charity-related complaints a month. App. in No. 19\u2013251, at 307.\nIt is not feasible for the Section, which has limited staff and\nresources, to conduct that many audits. See\nAppellant-Cross-Appellee\u2019s Excerpts of Record in No. 16\u201356855 etc.\n(CA9), pp. 512\u2013513. The subpoena process is also time consuming:\nLetters must go through multiple layers of review and waiting for a\nresponse causes further delays during which a charity can continue\nits malfeasance. App. in No. 19\u2013251, at 412.Implicitly acknowledging that audits and\nsubpoenas are more cumbersome and time consuming, the Court\ntrivializes the State\u2019s interest in what it calls \u201cease of\nadministration.\u201dAnte,at 15. Yet in various contexts, the\nCourt has recognized that an interest in \u201cefficiency\u201d is critical\nto the effective operation of public agencies.[9] See,e.g.,Baileyv.United\nStates,568\nU.S. 186, 200 (2013) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement interests in\nconducting a safe and efficient search\u201d justify detaining\n\u201coccupants on the premises during the execution of a search\nwarrant\u201d);Civil Service Comm\u2019nv.Letter Carriers,413 U.S.\n548, 564 (1973) (seeking a constitutional balance between the\ninterests of a government employee in commenting on matters of\npublic concern and the interest of the government in the efficiency\nof the services it performs).In addition to being burdensome, audit letters\nand subpoenas can also significantly undercut the Section\u2019s work by\nalerting an organization to the existence of an investigation,\ngiving it a chance to hide assets or tamper with evidence. The\nCourt dismisses this concern as unsubstantiated. Yet one Section\nhead reported that this had \u201chappened several times,\u201d and another\ntestified to her personal experience with organizations\n\u201cfabricat[ing]\u201d and \u201cdestroy[ing] records\u201d after being tipped off\nto an investigation. 16\u201355727 ER, at 590, 998\u2013999.[10] A State surely has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring that the subject of an investigation does not\ndestroy evidence or hide funds before investigators have an\nopportunity to find them. Cf.Kentuckyv.King,563 U.S.\n452, 460 (2011) (\u201c[T]he need to prevent the imminent\ndestruction of evidence has long been recognized as a sufficient\njustification for a warrantless search\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The Court ignores those interests here.IVIn a final coup de gr\u00e2ce, the Court concludes\nthat California\u2019s reporting requirement is unconstitutional not\njust as applied to petitioners, but on its very face. \u201cIn the First\nAmendment context,\u201d such broad relief requires proof that the\nrequirement is unconstitutional in \u201c\u00a0\u2018a substantial number of\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. applications .\u00a0.\u00a0. , judged in relation\nto the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited\nStatesv.Stevens,559 U.S.\n460, 473 (2010). \u201cFacial challenges are disfavored for several\nreasons,\u201d prime among them because they \u201coften rest on\nspeculation.\u201dWashington State Grangev.Washing-ton State Republican Party,552 U.S.\n442, 450 (2008). Speculation is all the Court has. The Court\npoints to not a single piece of record evidence showing that\nCalifornia\u2019s reporting requirement will chill \u201ca substantial\nnumber\u201d of top donors from giving to their charities of\nchoice.[11] Yet it strikes\nthe requirement down in every application.The average donor is probably at most agnostic\nabout having their information confidentially reported to\nCalifornia\u2019s attorney general. A significant number of the\ncharities registered in California engage in uncontroversial\npursuits. They include hospitals and clinics; educational\ninstitutions; orchestras, operas, choirs, and theatrical groups;\nmuseums and art exhibition spaces; food banks and other\norganizations providing services to the needy, the elderly, and the\ndisabled; animal shelters; and organizations that help maintain\nparks and gardens. Brief for Public Citizen et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae12\u201313. It is somewhat hard to fathom that donors to the\nAnderson Elementary School PTA, the Loomis-Eureka Lakeside Little\nLeague, or the Santa Barbara County Horticultural Society\n(\u201c[c]elebrating plants since 1880\u201d) are less likely to give because\ntheir do-nations are confidentially reported to\nCalifornia\u2019s Charitable Trusts Section.[12]In fact, research shows that the vast majority\nof donors prefer to publicize their charitable contributions. See\nDrennan, Where Generosity and Pride Abide: Charitable Naming\nRights, 80 U. Cin. L. Rev. 45, 50 (2011) (\u201cResearch reveals that\nanonymous largesse from the wealthy has become rare\u201d); Posner,\nAltruism, Status, and Trust in the Law of Gifts and Gratuitous\nPromises, 1997 Wis. L. Rev. 567, 574, n. 17 (\u201c[C]haritable gifts\nare rarely made anonymously\u201d). One study found that anonymous\ngifting accounted for less than 1% of all donations to Yale Law\nSchool, Harvard Law School, and Carnegie Mellon University. Glazer\n& Konrad, A Signaling Explanation for Charity, 86 Am. Econ.\nRev. 1019, 1021 (1996). Symptomatic of this trend is the explosion\nin charitable naming rights since the mid-1990s. Drennan, 80 U.\nCin. L. Rev., at 50, 55. As one author has recounted, \u201cevery nook\nand cranny of [public] buildings\u201d is now \u201ctagged by some wealthy,\ngenerous and obviously not publicity-shy donor.\u201d Isherwood, The\nGraffiti of the Philanthropic Class, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Dec. 2,\n2007.Of course, it is always possible that an\norganization is inherently controversial or for an apparently\ninnocuous organization to explode into controversy. The answer,\nhowever, is to ensure that confidentiality measures are sound or,\nin the case of public disclosures, to require a procedure for\ngovernments to address requests for exemptions in a timely manner.\nIt is not to hamper all government law enforcement efforts by\nforbidding confidential disclosures en masse.Indeed, this Court has already rejected such an\nindiscriminate approach in the specific context of disclosure\nrequirements. Just over a decade ago, inReed, petitioners\ndemonstrated that their own supporters would face reprisal if their\nopposition to expanding domestic partnership laws became public.\nThat evidence did not support a facial challenge to Washington\u2019s\npublic disclosure law, however, because the \u201ctypical referendum\npetitio[n] concern[ed] tax policy, revenue, budget, or other state\nlaw issues,\u201d and \u201cthere [was] no reason to assume that any burdens\nimposed by disclosure of typical referendum petitions would be\nremotely like the burdens plaintiffs fear in this case.\u201d 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 200\u2013201 (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoid.,at 202\u2013203 (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201cMany referendum\npetitions concern relatively uncontroversial matters, and\nplaintiffs have provided no reason to think that disclosure of\nsignatory information in those contexts would significantly chill\nthe willingness of voters to sign. Plaintiffs\u2019 facial challenge\ntherefore must fail\u201d (citation omitted)).So too here. Many charitable organizations\n\u201cconcern relatively uncontroversial matters\u201d and petitioners \u201chave\nprovided no reason to think that\u201d confidential disclosure of donor\ninformation \u201cwould significantly chill the willingness of\u00a0\u201d\nmost donors to give. Nor does the Court provide such a reason. It\nmerely highlights threats that public disclosure would pose to\nthese two petitioners\u2019 supporters. Those threats provide \u201cscant\nevidence\u201d of anything beyond \u201cthe specific harm\u201d that petitioners\u2019\ndonors might experience were their Schedule B information publicly\ndisclosed.Id., at 200\u2013201. Petitioners\u2019 \u201cfacial challenge\ntherefore must fail.\u201dId.,at 203 (Alito, J.,\nconcurring).How, then, can their facial challenge succeed?\nOnly because the Court has decided, in a radical departure from\nprecedent, that there no longer need be any evidence that a\ndisclosure requirement is likely to cause an objective burden on\nFirst Amendment rights before it can be struck down.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Today\u2019s decision discards decades of First\nAmendment jurisprudence recognizing that reporting and disclosure\nrequirements do not directly burden associational rights. There is\nno other explanation for the Court\u2019s conclusion that, first,\nplaintiffs do not need to show they are actually burdened by a\ndisclosure requirement; second, every disclosure requirement\ndemands narrow tailoring; and third, a facial challenge can succeed\nin the absence of any evidence a state law burdens the\nassociational rights of a substantial proportion of affected\nindividuals.That disclosure requirements directly burden\nassociational rights has been the view of Justice Thomas, seeid., at 232 (dissenting opinion), but it has never been the\nview of this Court. Just 11 years ago, eight Members of the Court,\nincluding two Members of the current majority, recognized that\ndisclosure requirements do not directly interfere with First\nAmendment rights. Seeid.,at 196 (majority opinion). In an\nopinion barely mentioned in today\u2019s decision, the Court inReeddid the opposite of what the Court does today. First,\nit demanded objective evidence that disclosure risked exposing\nsupporters to threats and reprisals; second, it required only a\nloose means-end fit in light of the \u201cmodest\u201d burden it found; and\nthird, it rejected a facial challenge given petitioners\u2019 failure to\nestablish that signatories to the \u201ctypical\u201d referendum had any\nreason to fear disclosure. Seeid.,at 200\u2013201. In so doing,\nthe Court ensured that it would not \u201cshort circuit the democratic\nprocess by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from\nbeing implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\u201dWashington State Grange, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 451.The Court 11 years later apparently has a\ndifferent view of its role. It now calls upon the federal courts to\nserve \u201cas virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness\nof [governmental] action.\u201dLaird, 408 U.\u00a0S., at 15.\nThere is no question that petitioners have shown that their donors\nreasonably fear reprisals if their identities are publicly exposed.\nThe Court and I, however, disagree about the likelihood of that\nhappening and the role Schedule Bs play in the investigation of\ncharitable malfeasance. If the Court had simply granted as-applied\nrelief to petitioners based on its reading of the facts, I would be\nsympathetic, although my own views diverge. But the Court\u2019s\ndecision is not nearly so narrow or modest. Instead, the Court\njettisons completely the longstanding requirement that plaintiffs\ndemonstrate an actual First Amendment burden before the Court will\nsubject government action to close scrutiny. It then invalidates a\nregulation in its entirety, even though it can point to no record\nevidence demonstrating that the regulation is likely to chill a\nsubstantial proportion of donors. These moves are wholly\ninconsistent with the Court\u2019s precedents and our Court\u2019s long-held\nview that disclosure requirements only indirectly burden First\nAmendment rights. With respect, I dissent.Notes1Schedule Bs are kept in a\nconfidential database used only by the Charitable Trusts Section\nand inaccessible to others in California\u2019s attorney general\u2019s\noffice. Employees who fail to safeguard confidential information\nare subject to discipline. See generally Cal. Govt. Code Ann.\n\u00a719572 (West 2009). In light of previous security breaches\ndisclosed in this litigation, seeante, at 5, the attorney\ngeneral\u2019s office instituted a series of measures to ensure that\nSchedule B information remains confidential. The office has adopted\na system of text searching forms before they are uploaded onto the\nInternet to ensure that none contain Schedule B information. The\noffice now also runs automated scans of publicly accessible\ngovernment databases to identify and remove any documents\ncontaining Schedule B information that may be inadvertently\nuploaded. SeeAmericans for Prosperity Foundationv.Becerra, 903 F.3d 1000, 1018 (CA9 2018).2See Part IV,infra.3See Hagley, Massive\nResistance\u2014The Rhetoric and the Reality, 27 N. M. L. Rev. 167, 203\n(1997).4For instance, the Court\ndid not ask whether the public disclosure of signatories\u2019 names and\naddresses was \u201cin proportion to the\u201d government\u2019s interest in\npolicing fraud.Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Nor did it feel any need to respond to the dissent\u2019s\ndescriptionof ways in which Washington\u2019s interest could be met\nwithout public disclosure.Reed, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 234\u2013238\n(opinion of Thomas, J.). It was enough that public disclosure could\n\u201chelp\u201d advance electoral integrity.Id., at 198 (majority\nopinion). The Court is clearly wrong to suggest it applied narrow\ntailoring inReed. Seeante,at 11.5The Court claims that\n\u201cbroadly stifle\u201d refers \u201cto the scope of challenged restrictions\u201d\nrather than \u201cthe severity of any demonstrated burden.\u201dAnte,at 11. That reading ignores the verb \u201cstifle\u201d and its object,\n\u201cfundamental personal liberties.\u201d The Court wishes the sentence\nsaid that a government interest \u201ccannot be pursued by [broad]\nmeans.\u201d It does not. The Court also finds meaning in the fact thatSheltoncriticized Arkansas\u2019 challenged disclosure regime\nfor not being narrowly tailored.Ante,at 11. But theSheltonCourt had already explained why the failure to\nnarrowly tailor was problematic: because the statute significantly\nburdened Arkansas teachers\u2019 associational rights. SeeShelton, 364 U. S., at 485\u2013487. In no way did the Court\nsuggest that narrow tailoring was necessary in the absence of a\nsignificant burden on associational rights.6The statement the Court\ncites fromBairdv.State Bar of Ariz.,401 U.S.\n1, 6 (1971) (plurality opinion), must be read in a similar\ncontext.Seeante, at 10\u201311.Bairdinvolved the\nArizona State Bar\u2019s requirement that lawyers seeking admission\ndisclose their organizational affiliations and face denial if they\ngave the wrong answers. The \u201cstate inquiries\u201d were not just\n\u201c[b]road and sweeping\u201d; they were designed to identify and\n\u201cpunis[h]\u201d applicants who \u201c[held] certain beliefs\u201d or were\n\u201cmember[s] of a particular political organization.\u201d 401 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 6. As the Court explained, \u201ca State may not inquire about a\nman\u2019s views or associations solely for the purpose of withholding a\nright or benefit because of what he believes.\u201dId.,at 7.\nThe Court nowhere suggests that California will \u201cpunish\u201d donors for\ntheir beliefs. That logic thus has no application here. The Court\nalso draws on language fromNAACPv.Button,371 U.S.\n415(1963).Ante,at 10. But that case did not involve a\ndisclosure requirement at all. It involved a law that made it a\ncrime for a person to advise another of the infringement of her\nlegal rights and to refer her to a group of attorneys, like the\nlegal staff of the NAACP, for assistance.7Although in the Court\u2019s\nview, the actual risk of reprisals is apparently irrelevant, the\nCourt notes that the District Court concluded that California\u2019s\nattorney general could not ensure the confidentiality of Schedule B\ninformation. Seeante,at 17, n. But the Ninth Circuit held\nthis finding to be clearly erroneous because the District Court\nrested its conclusion \u201csolely on the state\u2019spastinability\nto ensure confidentiality.\u201d 903 F.\u00a03d, at 1019 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The District Court never explained why\nthe current security measures were insufficient to protect donors\u2019\nconfidentiality. As the Ninth Circuit observed, \u201cthe changes the\nAttorney General has adopted since those breaches occurred\u201d show\nthat the \u201crisk of inadvertent disclosure ofanySchedule B\ninformation in the future is small, and the risk of inadvertent\ndisclosure ofthe plaintiffs\u2019Schedule B information in\nparticular is smaller still.\u201dIbid.; see also n.\u00a01,supra.8The Court goes so far as\nto suggest that the State does not rely on Schedule B collection to\n\u201cprevent and police fraud\u201d and to imply the District Court found\nthe same.Ante, at 13\u201314. Yet the District Court expressly\nacknowledged that it did \u201cnot doubt that the Attorney General does\nin fact use the Schedule Bs it collects.\u201dThomas More Law\nCenterv.Harris, 2016 WL 6781090, *2 (CD Cal., Nov. 16,\n2016).9Of course, an interest in\nefficiency cannot justify constitutional violations, but it is an\nimportant governmental interest when deciding whether a\nconstitutional violation has taken place at all. SeeBaileyv.United States,568 U.S.\n186, 199\u2013200 (2013).10The\nCourt asserts that \u201cthe actions of investigators\u201d do not \u201csuggest a\nrisk of tipping off charities\u201d because the Section\u2019s standard\npractice is to send an audit letter early in an investigation.Ante, at 14. Where the Section suspects serious fraud,\nhowever, it obtains a temporary restraining order to freeze assets\nbefore ever contacting the charity. See 16\u201355727 ER, at 591. The\nSection\u2019s actions thus demonstrate exactly the fear of tipping off\ncharities that this Court so hastily dismisses.11The\nCourt highlights the \u201cfilings of hundreds of organizations asamici curiaein support of\u00a0\u201d petitioners in this suit.Ante, at 17. Those briefs, of course, are not record\nevidence. Moreover, even if those organizations had each provided\nevidence that California\u2019s reporting requirement would subject\ntheir top donors to harassment and reprisals (they did not), this\nstill would not demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the\nreporting requirement\u2019s applications are unconstitutional when\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018judged in relation to [its] plainly legitimate\nsweep.\u2019\u00a0\u201dUnited Statesv.Stevens,559 U.S.\n460, 473 (2010). Some 60,000 charities renew their\nregistrations with California each year, and nearly all must file a\nSchedule B. Seeante,at 13. Theamiciare just a\nsmall fraction of the disclosure requirement\u2019s reach.12See\nCalifornia Dept. of Justice, Office of Atty.
