The majority reaches this conclusion, in flat\ncontravention of our cases interpreting the case-or-controversy\nrequirement of Article III, by reference to a historical tradition\nthat is, at best, equivocal. That history does not contradict what\ncommon sense should tell us: There is a legal difference between\nsomething and nothing. Respondents have nothing to gain from their\nlawsuit. Under settled principles of standing, that fact requires\ndismissal of their complaint.[Footnote 1]IArticle III of the Constitution\nconfines the judicial power of the federal courts to actual \u201cCases\u201d\nand \u201cControversies.\u201d \u00a72. As we have recently reaffirmed, \u201c[n]o\nprinciple is more fundamental to the judiciary\u2019s proper role in our\nsystem of government than the constitutional limitation of\nfederal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\u201dDaimlerChrysler Corp.v.Cuno,547 U. S. 332, 341\n(2006) (quotingRainesv.Byrd,521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997); internal\nquotation marks omitted). Unlike the political branches, directly\nelected by the people, the courts derive their authority under\nArticle III, including the power of judicial review, from \u201cthe\nnecessity \u2026 of carrying out the judicial function of deciding\ncases.\u201dCuno, supra,at 340. That is why Article III\ncourts \u201cmay exercise power only \u2026 \u2018as a necessity,\u2019\u00a0\u201d that is,\nonly when they are sure they have an actual case before them.Allenv.Wright,468 U. S. 737, 752\n(1984) (quotingChicago & Grand Trunk R. Co.v.Wellman,143 U. S. 339, 345\n(1892)). \u201cIf a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the\ncourts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the\ncourse of doing so.\u201dCuno, supra, at 341.Given the importance of assuring\na court\u2019s jurisdiction before deciding the merits of a case, \u201c[w]e\nhave always insisted on strict compliance with th[e] jurisdictional\nstanding requirement.\u201dRaines, supra, at 819. And until\ntoday, it has always been clear that a party lacking a direct,\npersonal stake in the litigation could not invoke the power of the\nfederal courts. SeeLujanv.Defenders of\nWildlife,504\nU. S. 555, 573 (1992) (plaintiff must demonstrate a \u201cconcrete\nprivate interest in the outcome of [the] suit\u201d);Lancev.Coffman, 549 U.

S. 490, 499\n(1975) (\u201cThe Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or\notherwise to protect against injuryto the complaining\nparty\u201d (emphasis added)).In recent years, we have elaborated the\nstanding requirements of Article III in terms of a three-part\ntest\u2014whether the plaintiff can demonstrate an injury in fact that\nis fairly traceable to the challenged actions of the defendant and\nlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. SeeSteel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U. S. 83, 102\u2013103 (1998). But\nregardless of how the test is articulated, \u201cthe point has always\nbeen the same: whether a plaintiff \u2018personallywould\nbenefit in a tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 103, n.\u00a05 (quotingWarth, supra, at\n508; emphasis added). An assignee who has acquired the bare legal\nright to prosecute a claim but no right to the substantive recovery\ncannot show that he has a personal stake in the litigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s decision today is unprecedented.Vermont Agency of Natural Resourcesv.United States\nex rel. Stevens,529 U. S. 765(2000),\ndoes not support it.Vermont Agency, in recognizing that aqui tamrelator as assignee of the United States had\nstanding to sue, did not dispense with the essential requirement of\nArticle III standing that the plaintiff have a \u201cconcrete private\ninterest in the outcome of [the] suit.\u201dId.,at 772\n(quotingLujan, supra, at 573; internal quotation marks\nomitted). InVermont Agency, thequi tamrelator\u2019s bounty was sufficient to establish standing because it\nrepresented a \u201cpartial assignment of the Government\u2019s damages\nclaim,\u201d encompassing both a legal right to assert the claimanda stake in the recovery. 529 U. S., at 773. Thus, it\nwas clear that the False Claims Act gave the \u201crelator himself an\ninterestin the lawsuit,\u201d in addition to \u201cthe right to\nretain a fee out of the recovery.\u201dId.,at 772.Here, respondents are authorized to bring suit\non behalf of the payphone operators, but they have no claim to the\nrecovery. Indeed, their take is not tied to the recovery in any\nway. Respondents receive their compensation based on the number of\npayphones and telephone lines operated by their clients, see App.\n198, not based on the measure of damages ultimately awarded by a\ncourt or paid by petitioners as part of a settlement. Respondents\nreceived the assignments only as a result of their willingness to\nassume the obligation of remitting any recovery to the assignors,\nthe payphone operators. That is, after all, the entire point of the\narrangement. The payphone operators assigned their claims to\nrespondents \u201cfor purposes of collection,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n114a; respondents never had any share in the amount collected. The\nabsence of any right to the substantive recovery means that\nrespondents cannot benefit from the judgment they seek and thus\nlack Article III standing. \u201cWhen you got nothing, you got nothing\nto lose.\u201d Bob Dylan, Like A Rolling Stone, on Highway 61 Revisited\n(Columbia Records 1965).To be sure, respondents doubtless have more\nthan just a passing interest in the litigation. As collection\nagencies, respondents must demonstrate that they are willing to\nmake good on their threat to pursue their clients\u2019 claims in\nlitigation. Even so, \u201can interest that is merely a \u2018byproduct\u2019 of\nthe suit itself cannot give rise to a cognizable injury in fact for\nArticle III standing purposes.\u201dVermont Agency, supra, at\n773. The benefit respondents would receive\u2014the general business\ngoodwill that would result from a successful verdict, the ability\nto collect dial-around compensation for their clients more\neffectively\u2014is nothing more than a byproduct of the current\nlitigation. Such an interest cannot support their standing to sue\nin federal court. Cf.Steel Co., supra, at 107 (the costs\nof investigating and prosecuting a substantive claim do not give\nrise to standing to assert the claim);Diamondv.Charles,476\nU. S. 54, 70 (1986) (an interest in recovering attorney\u2019s fees\ndoes not confer standing to litigate the underlying claim).The undeniable consequence of today\u2019s decision\nis that a plaintiff need no longer demonstrate a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the litigation. Instead, the majority has replaced\nthe personal stake requirement with a completely impersonal one.\nThe right to sue is now the exact opposite of a personal claim\u2014it\nis a marketable commodity. By severing the right to recover from\nthe right to prosecute a claim, the Court empowersanyoneto bring suit on any claim, whether it be the first assignee, the\nsecond, the third, or so on. But, as we have said in another\ncontext, standing is not \u201ccommutative.\u201dCuno, 547 U. S.,\nat 352. Legal claims, at least those brought in federal court, are\nnot fungible commodities.The source of the Court\u2019s mistake is easy to\nidentify. The Court goes awry when it asserts that the standing\ninquiry focuses on whether theinjuryis likely to be\nredressed, not whether thecomplainingparty\u2019sinjury is likely to be redressed. Seeante, at 17\u201318. That\ncould not be more wrong. We have never approved federal-court\njurisdiction over a claim where the entire relief requested will\nrun to a party not before the court. Never. The Court commits this\nmistake by treating the elements of standing as separate strands\nrather than as interlocking and related elements meant to ensure a\npersonal stake. Our cases do not condone this approach.The Court expressly rejected such an argument\ninVermont Agency, where the relator argued that he was\n\u201csuing to remedy an injury in fact suffered by the United States.\u201d\n529 U. S., at 771. We dismissed the argument out of hand, noting\nthat \u201c[t]he Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or\notherwise to protect against injuryto the complaining\nparty.\u201dId.,at 771\u2013772 (quotingWarth, 422\nU. S., at 499; emphasis inVermont Agency; internal\nquotation marks omitted). Although the Court\u2019s analysis in that\nsection of the opinion concerned the right of the relator to assert\nthe United States\u2019injury, the Court treated it as\naxiomatic that any \u201credress\u201d must also redound to the benefit of\nthe relator.InSteel Co., the Court similarly\nrejected a basis for standing that turned on relief sought\u2014the\nimposition of civil penalties\u2014that was \u201cpayable to the United\nStates Treasury,\u201d but not to the plaintiff. 523 U. S., at 106. We\nobserved that the plaintiff sought \u201cnot remediation of itsowninjury,\u201d but merely the \u201cvindication of the rule of\nlaw.\u201dIbid. (emphasis added). Importantly, the Court\nrecognized that \u201c[r]elief that does not remedy the injury suffered\ncannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very\nessence of the redressability requirement.\u201dId.,at 107.\nAgain, the Court\u2019s emphasis on theparty\u2019sinjury makes\nclear that the basis for rejecting standing inSteel Co.was the fact that the remedy sought would not benefit the party\nbefore the Court.The majority\u2019s view of the Article III\nredressability requirement is also incompatible with what we said\ninRaines,521 U. S. 811. In that case, we held\nthat individual Members of Congress lacked standing to contest the\nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. We observed that the\nCongressmen \u201cdo not claim that they have been deprived of something\nto which theypersonallyare entitled.\u201dId.,at\n821. Rather, the Members sought to enforce a right that ran to\ntheir office, not to their person. \u201cIf one of the Members were to\nretire tomorrow, he would no longer have a claim; the claim would\nbe possessed by his successor instead. The claimed injury thus runs\n(in a sense) with the Member\u2019s seat, a seat which the Member holds\n\u2026 as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal\npower.\u201dIbid. We therefore held that the individual\nMembers did \u201cnot have a sufficient \u2018personal stake\u2019 in th[e]\ndispute\u201d to maintain their challenge.Id.,at 830. See\nalsoWarth, supra, at 506 (denying standing where \u201cthe\nrecord is devoid of any indication\u201d that the requested \u201crelief\nwould benefit petitioners\u201d);Simonv.Eastern Ky.\nWelfare Rights Organization,426 U. S. 26, 39, 42\n(1976) (denying standing to plaintiffs who did not \u201cstand to profit\nin somepersonalinterest\u201d because it was \u201cpurely\nspeculative\u201d whether the relief sought \u201cwould result inthese\nrespondents\u2019 receiving the hospital services they desire\u201d\n(emphasis added)).The majority finds that respondents have a\nsufficient stake in this litigation because the substantive\nrecovery will initially go to them, and \u201c[w]hat does it matter what\nthe aggregators do with the money afterward?\u201dAnte, at 18.\nThe majority\u2019s assertion implies, incorrectly, that respondents\nhave, or ever had, a choice of what to do with the recovery. It may\nbe true that a plaintiff\u2019sindependentdecision to pledge\nhis recovery to another, as in respondents\u2019 hypothetical of an\n\u201coriginalowner of a claim who signs a collateral\nagreement with a charity obligating herself to donate every penny\nshe recovers in [the] litigation,\u201d Brief for Respondents 21, would\nnot divest the plaintiff of Article III standing. But respondents\nnever had the right to direct the disposition of the recovery; they\nhave only the right to sue. The hypothetical plaintiff who chooses\nto pledge her recovery to charity, by contrast, will secure a\npersonal benefit from the recovery. Unlike respondents\u2019 claims, the\nhypothetical plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing claim is not tied in any way\nto her separate agreement to direct her recovery to charity. She\nhas more than the right to sue; she has the right to exercise her\nindependent authority to direct the proceeds as she sees fit. In\nthat situation, the Article III requirement that a plaintiff\ndemonstrate a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation is\nsatisfied.[Footnote 2]The Court believes that these standing\nprinciples, embodying a \u201ccore component derived directly from the\nConstitution,\u201dAllen, 468 U. S., at 751, that is of\n\u201cparticular importance in ensuring that the Federal Judiciary\nrespects the proper\u2014and properly limited\u2014role of the courts in a\ndemocratic society,\u201d and that is \u201ccrucial in maintaining the\ntripartite allocation of power set forth in the Constitution,\u201dCuno,547 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), should yield \u201cas a practical matter\u201d to the prospect that\na contrary \u201cholding could easily be overcome,\u201dante, at\n20. The Court chooses to elevate expediency above the strictures\nimposed by the Constitution. That is a tradeoff the Constitution\ndoes not allow. Cf.Raines, supra, at 820 (\u201c[W]e must put\naside the natural urge to proceed directly to the merits of this\nimportant dispute and to \u2018settle\u2019 it for the sake of convenience\nand efficiency\u201d). Perhaps it is true that a \u201cdollar or two,\u201dante, at 20, would give respondents a sufficient stake in\nthe litigation. Article III is worth a dollar. And in any case, the\nease with which respondents can comply with the requirements of\nArticle III is not a reason to abandon our precedents; it is a\nreason to adhere to them.IIGiven all this, it is\nunderstandable that the majority opts to minimize its reliance on\nmodern standing principles and to retreat to a broad, generalized\nreading of the historical tradition of assignments. But that\nhistory does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion.The first problem lies in\nidentifying the relevant tradition. Much of the majority\u2019s\nhistorical analysis focuses on the generic (and undisputed) point\nthat common law and equity courts eventually permitted assignees to\nsue on their assigned claims. Seeante, at 5\u201310. I would\ntreat that point as settled as much bystare decisis, seeVermont Agency, 529 U. S., at 773, as by the historic\npractice of the King\u2019s Bench and Chancery. But the general history\nof assignments says nothing about the particular aspect of suits\nbrought on assigned claims that is relevant to this case: whether\nan assignee who has acquired the legal right to sue, but no right\nto any substantive recovery, can maintain an action in court. On\nthat precise question, the historical sources are either\nnonexistent or equivocal.ANone of the English common-law\nsources on which the majority relies establishes that assignmentsof this sortwould be permitted either at law or in\nequity. As the majority\u2019s discussion makes clear, both systems\npermitted suits brought on assignments\u2014either in equity by an\nassignee having a beneficial interest in the litigation, or at law\nby an assignee who had a power of attorney and sued in the name of\nthe assignor. Seeante, at 6\u20138. But at all times, suits\nbased on assignments remained subject to the prohibition on\nchamperty and maintenance. See 7 W. Holdsworth, History of English\nLaw 535\u2013536 (1926).[Footnote 3]\nBy the 18th century, an assignment no longer constituted\nmaintenanceper se, seeid., at 536, but it\nappears to have been an open question whether an assignment of the\n\u201c[b]are [r]igh[t] to [l]itigate\u201d would fail as \u201c[s]avouring\u201d of\nchamperty and maintenance, see M. Smith, Law of Assignment: The\nCreation and Transfer of Choses in Action 318, 321 (2007). In order\nto sustain an assignment of the right to sue, the assignment had to\ninclude the transfer of a property interest to which the right of\naction was incident or subsidiary.Id.,at 321\u2013322; see\nalsoProsserv.Edmonds, 1 Y. & C. Exch. 481,\n160 Eng. Rep. 196 (1835);Dickinsonv.Burrell,\n35 Beav. 257, 55 Eng. Rep. 894 (1866); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on\nEquity Jurisprudence \u00a71040h, pp. 234\u2013235 (8th ed. 1861);\nR. Megarry & P. Baker, Snell\u2019s Principles of Equity 82 (25th\ned. 1960).American courts as well\nunderstood the common-law rule to require a transfer of interest to\nthe assignee\u2014over and above the \u201cnaked right to bring a suit\u201d\u2014that\ngave the assignee a \u201cvaluable right of property.\u201dTraerv.Clews,115\nU. S. 528, 541 (1885). A New York court, surveying the English\nsources, concluded that \u201can assignment to the plaintiff of the\nassignor\u2019s right to maintain and prosecute an action for the\nspecific performance of defendants\u2019 agreement, amounts to nothing\nmore than an assertion that the assignor has undertaken to assign\nto the plaintiff a bare right to litigate for the former\u2019s benefit\nexclusively.\u201dWilliamsv.Boyle, 1 Misc. 364,\n367, 20 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0S. 720, 722 (Ct. Common Pleas 1892). To\nsecure standing in a court of equity, the court held, \u201cit must\nappear that the assignee\u2019s successful prosecution of the action is\nsusceptible ofpersonalenjoymentby\nhim\u2026\u00a0.\u201dIbid. (emphasis added).So while there is no doubt that at common law,\ncourts of law and equity sought ways of protecting the rights of\nassignees, they did not do so to the exclusion of the age-long\nobjection to maintenance, which could be found when the assignee\nlacked a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the\nlitigation. During the common-law period at least, it remained an\nopen question whether an assignee for collection, who by agreement\ntook nothing from the suit, had a sufficient interest in the\nassigned debt to support his right to sue.To be sure, the assignments at issue here\npurport to give respondents \u201call rights, title and interest\u201d in the\npayphone operators\u2019 claims for dial-around compensation. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 114a. But when severed from the right to retain any\nof the substantive recovery, it is not clear that common-law courts\nof law or equity would have treated the assigned right to litigate\nas incidental or subsidiary to the interest represented by the\nclaim itself. Cf. 7 Holdsworth,supra, at 538 (\u201c[I]t was\nnot till certain classes of rights \u2026 became more freely assignable\nin equity, that it became necessary to distinguish between the\ncases in which assignment was permitted and cases in which it was\nnot; and it is for this reason that we find very little clear\nauthority on these questions till quite modern times\u201d).[Footnote 4]I do not take the majority\u2019s point to be that\nthe common-law tradition supplies the answer to this question. As\nthe majority concedes, it was not until the 19th century that\n\u201ccourts began to consider the specific question presented here.\u201dAnte, at 10. But even granting this starting point, the\nCourt\u2019s recitation of the 19th-century tradition fails to account\nfor the deep divergence in practice regarding the right of\nassignees with no stake in the substantive recovery to maintain an\naction in court.The majority concedes that \u201csomeStates during this period of time refused to recognize\nassignee-for-collection suits,\u201dante, at 12, but that\nrefusal was substantially more widespread than the majority\nacknowledges. SeeRobbinsv.Deverill, 20 Wis.\n142 (1865);Bostwickv.Bryant, 113 Ind. 448, 16\nN. E. 378 (1888);Mosesv.Ingram, 99 Ala. 483,\n12 So. 374 (1893);Brownv.Ginn, 66 Ohio St.\n316, 64 N. E. 123 (1902);Coombsv.Harford, 99\nMe. 426, 59 A. 529 (1904);Martinv.Mask, 158 N.\nC. 436, 74 S. E. 343 (1912). These courts concluded that assignees\nhaving no legal or beneficial interest to vindicate could not sue\non the assigned claims.Several more States, including some enlisted\nby the majority, only eventually recognized the right of assignees\nfor collection to sue after taking inconsistent positions on the\nissue. In fact, the rule regarding assignees for collection only\nwas so unsettled that the Kansas Supreme Court reversed itself\ntwice in the span of 19 years. CompareKrappv.Eldridge, 33 Kan. 106, 5 P. 372 (1885) (assignees for\ncollection only may sue as the real party in interest), withStewartv.Price, 64 Kan. 191, 67 P. 553 (1902)\n(assignees for collection only may not sue), withManleyv.Park, 68 Kan. 400, 75 P. 557 (1904) (assignees for\ncollection only may sue again). During this period, many other\ncourts reversed course on the flinty problem posed by assignees for\ncollection only. SeeHoaglandv.Van Etten, 23\nNeb. 462, 36 N.\u00a0W. 755 (1888), overruled byArcherv.Musick, 147 Neb. 1018, 25 N.\u00a0W. 2d 908 (1947);State ex rel. Freebournv.Merchant\u2019s Credit Serv.,\nInc., 104 Mont. 76, 66 P.\u00a02d 337 (1937), overruled byRaev.Cameron, 112 Mont. 159, 114 P.\u00a02d\n1060 (1941).The majority\u2019s survey of 19th-century judicial\npractice thus ignores a substantial contrary tradition during this\nperiod. That tradition makes clear that state courtsdid\nnotregularly \u201centertai[n] suits virtually identical to the\nlitigation before us.\u201dAnte, at 10. In reality, all that\nthe majority\u2019s cases show is that the question whether assignees\nfor collection could maintain an action in court was hotly\ncontested\u2014a live issue that spawned much litigation and diverse\npublished decisions. The confusion was much remarked on by courts\nof this period, even those that ultimately sided with the Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of the prevailing practice. See,e.g.,Gomerv.Stockdale, 5 Colo. App. 489, 492, 39 P.\n355, 356 (1895) (\u201cThere is much controversy in the various states\nrespecting that almost universal code provision, that a suit must\nbe prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest\u201d);Comptonv.Atwell, 207 F. 2d 139, 140\u2013141 (CADC\n1953) (\u201c[W]hether an assignee for collection only is the real party\nin interest \u2026 has produced a variance of judicial opinion\u201d and \u201chas\nso divided other courts\u201d).Commentators have also called attention to the\ndivergent practice. As the majority notes, John Norton Pomeroy\nobserved that \u201cthere is some conflict\u201d on the question whether an\nassignee for collection obligated to \u201caccount for the whole\nproceeds \u2026 is entitled to sue in his own name.\u201d Remedies and\nRemedial Rights \u00a7132, p. 159 (1876) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). See also M. Ferguson, Comment, The Real Party in Interest\nRule Revitalized: Recognizing Defendant\u2019s Interest in the\nDetermination of Proper Parties Plaintiff, 55 Cal. L. Rev. 1452,\n1475 (1967) (\u201cNowhere do the courts manifest more confusion than in\ndeciding whether an assignee for collection only is a real party in\ninterest\u201d); Note, 51 Mich. L. Rev. 587, 588 (1953) (observing that\n\u201c[t]here is, however, little agreement among the courts as to the\nmeaning and purpose of [real party in interest] provisions\u201d and\nnoting that they have been construed \u201cto prevent the owner of the\nbare legal title to a chose in action from suing\u201d). Indeed, notable\nlegal commentators of the period argued against permitting suits by\nassignees for collection. See,e.g.,1 J. Kerr, Law of\nPleading and Practice \u00a7586, pp. 791\u2013792 (1919) (\u201c[T]he party in\nwhom the legal interest is vested is not always the real party in\ninterest. \u2018The \u2018real party in interest\u2019 is the party who would be\nbenefited or injured by the judgment in the cause\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. The\nrule should be restricted to parties whose interests are in issue,\nand are to be affected by the decree\u201d).This unsettled and conflicting state of\naffairs is understandable given the transformation in the\nunderstanding of the common-law prohibition on suits by assignees\nwith no beneficial interest. The immediate cause for this\ntransformation was the merger of law and equity, and the creation\nof real party in interest provisions intended to reconcile the two\nforms of actions.Allenv.Brown, 44 N.\u00a0Y.\n228, 231 (1870) (noting that New York code provision allowing\nassignees to sue as the real party in interest \u201cabolishe[d] the\ndistinction between actions at law and suits in equity\u201d); seeante, at 10. The fusion of law and equity forced courts to\nconfront the novel question of what to do with assignees for\ncollection only, who could not sue at law in their own name, and\nwho could not recover on a bill in equity for the lack of any\nbeneficial interest to enforce. Were such assignees, under the new\nsystem, real parties in interest who could bring suit? It is not\nsurprising that courts took conflicting positions on this question,\na question for which the historical tradition did not provide an\nanswer. Given this, it is difficult to characterize a practice as\nshowing what sort of cases and controversies were\n\u201ctraditionallyamenable to \u2026 the judicial process,\u201dSteel Co., 523 U. S., at 102 (emphasis added), when the\npractice was a self-consciousbreakin tradition.InVermont Agency, by contrast, the\nCourt relied on a long and unbroken tradition of informer statutes\nthat reached back to the 14th century and prevailed up to the\n\u201cperiod immediately before and after the framing of the\nConstitution.\u201d 529 U. S., at 776. The Court noted that the American\nColonies \u201cpass[ed] several informer statutes expressly authorizingqui tamsuits,\u201d and that the First Congress itself\n\u201cenacted a considerable number of informer statutes.\u201dIbid. This tradition provided relevant evidence of what\nthe Framers in 1787 would have understood the terms \u201ccase\u201d and\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d to mean. SeeColemanv.Miller,307 U. S. 433,\n460 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (the Article III\n\u201c[j]udicial power could come into play only in matters that were\nthe traditional concern of the courts at Westminster and only if\nthey arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constituted\n\u2018Cases\u2019 or \u2018Controversies\u2019\u00a0\u201d).[Footnote 5]There is certainly no comparable tradition\nhere. The belated innovations of the mid- to late-19th-century\ncourts come too late to provide insight into the meaning of Article\nIII. Although we have sometimes looked to cases postdating the\nfounding era as evidence of common-law traditions, we have never\ndone so when the courts self-consciously confronted novel questions\narising from a break in the received tradition, or where the\npractice of later courts was so divergent. A belated and equivocal\ntradition cannot fill in for the fundamental requirements of\nArticle III where, as here, those requirements are so plainly\nlacking.BNor do our own cases establish\nthat we \u201clong ago indicated that assignees for collection only can\nproperly bring suit.\u201dAnte, at 14. (If the majority truly\nbelieved that, one would expect the cases to be placed front and\ncenter in the Court\u2019s analysis, rather than as an afterthought.)\nNone addressed the requirements of Article III, and so none\nconstitutes binding precedent. SeeSteel Co., supra, at 91\n(\u201c[D]rive-by jurisdictional rulings of this sort \u2026 have no\nprecedential effect\u201d);Lewisv.Casey,518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2\n(1996) (\u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that the existence of\nunaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential\neffect\u201d).InWaitev.Santa\nCruz,184 U. S.\n302(1902), we addressed the then-existing statutory provision\nthat barred jurisdiction over suits \u201cimproperly or collusively made\nor joined \u2026 for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or\nremovable under this act.\u201dId.,at 325. We held that a\nplaintiff who took legal title of multiple bonds \u201cfor purposes of\ncollection\u201d could not satisfy the statute when the bonds\nindividually did not meet the amount in controversy requirement.Ibid. The Court did not say that the \u201csuitcouldproperly be brought in federal court,\u201dante, at 14, if the\nonly objection was the limitation placed on the plaintiff\u2019s\nassignment; instead, the Court remarked that such a limited\nassignment would not violate thestatutoryprohibition on\nsuits that are \u201cimproperly or collusively made or joined,\u201dWaite,supra, at 325.InSpillerv.Atchison, T. &\nS. F. R. Co.,253 U. S. 117(1920),\nthe plaintiff, secretary of the Cattle Raisers\u2019 Association, sued\nto enforce an order of reparations issued by the Interstate\nCommerce Commission, which found that the defendant railroads had\ncharged excessive shipping rates to the members of the association.\nThe question before the Court was the validity of the lower court\u2019s\nruling that the assignments to the plaintiff\u2014which reserved a\nbeneficial interest in the assignors, the individual members of the\nassociation\u2014did not vest legal title in the secretary \u201cso as [to]\nauthorize the commission to make the award of damages in his name.\u201dId.,at 134. We concluded that the agency was authorized\nto issue the reparations order in the name of the plaintiff because\nthe assignments were \u201cabsolute in form.\u201dIbid. We then\nconcluded that \u201cbeneficial or equitable title\u201d was not necessary\nfor the plaintiff \u201cto claim an award of reparation\u201d and enforce\nthat award in his own name in court.Ibid. In other words,\nthe Court addressed merely the question whether it was appropriate\nfor a federal agency (not bound by the constraints of Article III)\nto enter an award in the plaintiff\u2019s name. In no way did the Court\nendorse the right of an assignee for collection to sue as an\ninitial matter in federal court.Nor did the Court address Article III standing\nrequirements inTitusv.Wallick,306 U. S. 282(1939).\nThere, we found that an assignment \u201cfor purposes of suit,\u201d where\nthe assignee had an obligation to account for the proceeds (in\npart) to another, did not render the assignment invalid under New\nYorkstate law.Id.,at 289. Thus, we held that\nthe Ohio courts had failed to give full faith and credit to an\nearlier, valid New York court judgment.Id.,at 292. If we\nhad been presented with the Article III question, we would likely\nhave found it significant that the plaintiff-assignee stood to take\nthe balance of any recovery after the proceeds were used to\ndischarge the debts of the assignor (plaintiff\u2019s brother) and the\nplaintiff\u2019s wife.Id.,at 286. But in any event, the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that the assignment was valid under New York\nlaw, where the restrictions of Article III do not operate, does not\nsupport the view that suits by assignees for collection are\npermissible in federal courts.CWhen we have looked to history to\nconfirm our own Article III jurisdiction, we have relied on a\nfirmly entrenched historical tradition that served to confirm the\napplication of modern standing principles. SeeVermont\nAgency, 529 U. S., at 774\u2013778. The Court\u2019s decision today\nillustrates the converse approach. It relies on an equivocal and\ncontradictory tradition to override the clear application of the\ncase-or-controversy requirement that would otherwise bar\nrespondents\u2019 suit.But perhaps we should heed the\ncounsels of hope rather than despair. The majority, after all,\npurports to comply with our Article III precedents, seeante, at 16\u201318, so those precedents at least live to give\nmeaning to \u201cthe judiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of\ngovernment\u201d another day.Raines, 521 U. S., at 818. What\nis more, the majority expressly and repeatedly grounds its finding\nof standing on its conclusion that \u201chistory and precedent are\nclear\u201d that these types of suits \u201chave long been permitted,\u201dante, at 5, and that there is \u201ca strong tradition\u201d of such\nsuits \u201cduring the past two centuries,\u201dante, at 16, 19.\nThis conclusion is, for the reasons we have set forth, achingly\nwrong\u2014but at least the articulated test is clear and daunting.Finally, there is the majority\u2019s point that\nall this fuss could have been avoided for a dollar, seeante, at 20\u2014a price, by this point, that most readers\nwould probably be happy to contribute. The price will be higher in\nfuture standing cases. And when it is\u2014when standing really\nmatters\u2014it would be surprising if the Court were to look to a case\nin which it did not.I would vacate the decision of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.Footnote 1Because respondents have failed to\ndemonstrate that they have Article III standing to bring their\nclaims, I do not reach the question whether prudential\nconsiderations would also bar their suit.Footnote 2The majority believes that the examples of\ntrustees, guardians ad litem, receivers, and executors show that\n\u201cfederal courts routinely entertain suits which will result in\nrelief for parties that are not themselves directly bringing suit.\u201dAnte, at 18. None of these examples is pertinent to the\nquestion here. \u201cA guardian ad litem or next friend \u2026 is a nominal\nparty only; the ward is the real party in interest\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d\n6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a71548, pp. 373\u2013374 (2d ed. 1990). A receiver \u201cis\nconsidered to be an officer of the court, and therefore not an\nagent of the parties, whose appointment is incident to other\nproceedings in which some form of primary relief is sought.\u201d 12id.,\u00a72981, at 9\u201310 (2d ed. 1997) (footnote omitted).\nTrustees hold legal title to the assets in the trust estate and\nhave an independent fiduciary obligation to sue to preserve those\nassets. The trustee\u2019s discharge of its legal obligation is an\nindependent, personal benefit that supports the trustee\u2019s standing\nto sue in federal court. The majority\u2019s response that assignees for\ncollection only have a \u201ccontractualobligation to\nlitigate,\u201dante, at 19, is unavailing, because the\ncontractual obligation to sue and remit the proceeds of any\nrecovery was a condition of the assignment of the claim in the\nfirst place. The majority\u2019s reasoning is perfectly circular: A suit\npursuant to a contract to remit proceeds satisfies Article III\nbecause there is a contract to remit proceeds.In any event, the majority cannot dispute the\npoint that suits by trustees, guardians ad litem, executors, and\nthe like make up a settled, continuous practice \u201cof the sort\ntraditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201dSteel Co.v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U. S. 83, 102 (1998). As shown\nbelow, the same cannot be said for suits by assignees for\ncollection only. Seeinfra, at 12\u201315.Footnote 3Blackstone defined maintenance as the\n\u201cofficious intermeddling in a suit that no way belongs to one, by\nmaintaining or assisting either party with money or otherwise, to\nprosecute or defend it\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. This is an offense against\npublic justice, as it keeps alive strife and contention, and\nperverts the remedial process of the law into an engine of\noppression.\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *134\u2013*135. Champerty \u201cis\na species of maintenance, \u2026 being a bargain with a plaintiff or\ndefendantcampum partire, to divide the land or other\nmatter sued for between them, if they prevail at law; whereupon the\nchampertor is to carry on the party\u2019s suit at his own expense.\u201dId.,at *135.Footnote 4The fact that a bankrupt assignor could sue\nat law to recover debts for the benefit of an assignee creditor,\nseeante, at 8 (citingWinchv.Keeley,\n1 T. R. 619, 99 Eng. Rep. 1284 (K. B. 1787)), says nothing about\nthe issue in this case. It is of course true that one has standing\nto sue when the result of a favorable judgment will be the\ndischarge of a debt or other legal obligation. The only legal\nobligation respondents seek to discharge is the obligation to remit\nthe proceeds of the litigation to the payphone operators. But as\nexplained above, a party lacking the independent right to direct\nthe disposition of the proceeds cannot demonstrate the personal\nstake required to invoke the authority of an Article III court. Seesupra, at 7.Footnote 5The statutes from the American Colonies add\nnothing to the majority\u2019s historical argument. Seeante,\nat 9\u201310. Exceptions (some created by statute) to the general rule\nagainst assignments at law arose early in the common-law period,\nincluding exceptions for executors and administrators of estates,\nassignees in bankruptcy, negotiable instruments, and assignments\ninvolving the sovereign. See 29 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts\n\u00a774.2, pp. 214\u2013215 (4th ed. 2003). What none of these exceptions\nprovides for, however, are suits brought by assignees for\ncollection only\u2014i.e., assignees who have no share in the\nsubstantive recovery. Such assignees, as the majority acknowledges,\ndid not attract the attention of courts until the 19th century. Seeante, at 10.",
