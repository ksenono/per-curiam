S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-6053DWAYNE GILES, PETITIONERv.CALIFORNIAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ncalifornia[June 25, 2008]Justice Thomas, concurring.I write separately to note that I\nadhere to my view that statements like those made by the victim in\nthis case do not implicate the Confrontation Clause. The contested\nevidence is indistinguishable from the statements made during\npolice questioning in response to the report of domestic violence\ninHammonv.Indiana, decided withDavisv.Washington,547 U. S. 813(2006).\nThere, as here, the police questioning was not \u201ca formalized\ndialogue\u201d; it was not \u201csufficiently formal to resemble the Marian\nexaminations\u201d because \u201cthe statements were neither Mirandized nor\ncustodial, nor accompanied by any similar indicia of formality\u201d;\nand \u201cthere is no suggestion that the prosecution attempted to offer\n[Ms. Avie\u2019s] hearsay evidence at trial in order to evade\nconfrontation.\u201d Seeid., at 840 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part).Nonetheless, in this case respondent does not\nargue that the contested evidence is nontestimonial,ante,\nat 3; the court below noted \u201cno dispute\u201d on the issue, 40 Cal. 4th\n833, 841, 152 P.\u00a03d 433, 438 (2007); and it is outside the\nscope of the question presented, Brief for Petitioner i. Because\nthe Court\u2019s opinion accurately reflects our Confrontation Clause\njurisprudence where the applicability of that Clause is not at\nissue, I join the Court in vacating the decision below.",
