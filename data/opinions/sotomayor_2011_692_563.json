As the exchange between the majority and Justice\nKennedy demonstrates, the question whether Camreta, as a prevailing\nparty, can obtain our review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s constitutional\nruling is a difficult one. There is no warrant for reaching this\nquestion when there is clearly no longer a genuine case or\ncontroversy between the parties before us. SeeSinochem Int\u2019l\nCo.v.Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp.,549 U. S. 422, 436\n(2007) (noting that when a court can \u201creadily\u201d dispose of a case on\none threshold ground, it should not reach another one that \u201cis\ndifficult to determine\u201d). Indeed, it is improper for us to do so.\nCf.U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.v.Bonner Mall\nPartnership,513\nU. S. 18, 21 (1994) (\u201c[A] federal court [may not] decide the\nmerits of a legal question not posed in an Article III case or\ncontroversy\u201d).The majority suggests that we must decide\nwhether Camreta has a \u201cright to appeal\u201d in order to vacate the\njudgment below underUnited Statesv.Munsingwear,\nInc.,340 U. S.\n36(1950). Seeante, at 17, n.\u00a010; see alsoante, at 14, n.\u00a08. But that view does not accord with\nour past practice. SeeArizonans for Official Englishv.Arizona,520\nU. S. 43, 66, 70, 74\u201375 (1997) (ordering vacatur of a district\ncourt judgment without \u201cresolv[ing]\u201d our \u201cgrave doubts\u201d about the\npetitioners\u2019 appellate standing or deciding whether the state\nAttorney General had a right to intervene as a party, and\nconcluding only that he had statutory authority to \u201cpresent\nargument\u201d on appeal). Nor is it consistent with the principles\nunderlying our mootness jurisprudence. SeeWallingv.James V. Reuter, Inc.,321 U. S. 671, 677\n(1944) (\u201cIf a judgment has become moot, this Court \u2026 may make such\ndisposition of the whole case as justice may require\u201d). In\naccordance with our normal procedure for disposing of cases that\nhave become moot through no fault of the party seeking review, seeBancorp, 513 U. S., at 22\u201323;Munsingwear, 340 U.\nS., at 39\u201340, and n. 2, we should simply vacate the portion of the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s opinion Camreta sought to challenge and remand with\ninstructions to dismiss, see,e.g.,Indiana State\nPolice Pension Trustv.Chrysler LLC, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009)(per curiam).",
