    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTLIMTIACO V. CAMACHO549 U. S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-116ALICIA G. LIMTIACO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GUAM,\nPETITIONERv.FELIX P. CAMACHO, GOVERNOR OF GUAMon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nguam[March 27, 2007]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.The Legislature of Guam\nauthorized Guam\u2019s Governor to issue bonds to fund the Territory\u2019s\ncontinuing obligations. Concluding that the bonds would violate the\ndebt-limitation provision of the Organic Act of Guam, \u00a711, 64 Stat.\n387, as amended, 48 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71423a, the attorney\ngeneral[Footnote 1] of Guam\nrefused to sign contracts necessary to issue the bonds. In\nresponse, the Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme\nCourt that issuance of the bonds would not violate the Organic\nAct\u2019s debt limitation. The Guam Supreme Court held that \u00a71423a\nlimits Guam\u2019s allowed indebtedness to 10 percent of the appraised\nvaluation, not the assessed valuation, of taxable property in Guam.\nWe granted certiorari to decide whether Guam\u2019s debt limitation must\nbe calculated according to the assessed or the appraised valuation\nof property in Guam. We hold that it must be calculated based on\nthe assessed valuation.IIn 2003, Guam lacked sufficient\nrevenues to pay its obligations. To supplement revenues, the Guam\nLegislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds worth\napproximately $400 million. See Guam Pub. L. 27\u2013019. The Governor\nsigned the new legislation and prepared to issue the bonds.\nHowever, under Guam law, Guam\u2019s attorney general must review and\napprove all government contracts prior to their execution. Guam\nCode Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a722601 (1996). The attorney general concluded\nthat issuance of the bonds would raise the Territory\u2019s debt above\nthe level authorized by Guam\u2019s Organic Act. See 48 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71423a (prohibiting debt \u201cin excess of 10 per centum of the\naggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam\u201d). He therefore\nrefused to approve the bond contracts.In response, the Governor sought\na declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance of the\nauthorized bonds would not cause Guam\u2019s debt to exceed the debt\nlimitation. That determination turned, in part, on the meaning of\nthe phrase \u201caggregate tax valuation\u201d in Guam\u2019s Organic Act. The\nattorney general calculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of\nthe assessed valuation of property in Guam. But the Governor\ncalculated the debt limitation as 10 percent of the appraised\nvaluation. Because Guam assesses property at 35 percent of its\nappraised value, Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a724102(f), the attorney\ngeneral\u2019s interpretation resulted in a much lower debt limit. The\nGuam Supreme Court agreed with the Governor and held that 48 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71423a sets the debt limitation at 10 percent of the\nappraised valuation of property in Guam.The attorney general filed a petition for\ncertiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit. See \u00a71424\u20132 (granting Ninth Circuit jurisdiction over\nappeals from Guam). The Court of Appeals granted the petition in\nOctober 2003. While the appeal was pending, Congress amended\n\u00a71424\u20132 and removed the language that vested jurisdiction in the\nNinth Circuit over appeals from Guam. See \u00a72, 118 Stat. 2208, 48 U.\nS.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a71424\u20132 (West Supp. 2006). InSantosv.Guam, 436 F.\u00a03d 1051 (Jan. 3, 2006), the Court of\nAppeals addressed the effect of the amendment on its jurisdiction.\nThe court held that Congress had stripped its jurisdiction not only\nprospectively, but also for pending appeals.Id., at 1054.\nCitingSantos, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the attorney\ngeneral\u2019s appeal in this case on March 6, 2006. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 39a.The attorney general then filed a petition for\ncertiorari in this Court. By statute, certiorari petitions must be\nfiled \u201cwithin 90 days after the entry of \u2026 judgment\u201d in a lower\ncourt. 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72101(c). The attorney general filed his\npetition more than 90 days after the judgment from which he\nappeals\u2014that of the Guam Supreme Court\u2014was entered. Accordingly,\nwhen we granted certiorari in this case, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), we\ndirected the parties to address both the question presented by\npetitioner and whether the filing of a petition for certiorari or\nthe pendency of a writ of certiorari before the Court of Appeals\nsuspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s judgment for\npurposes of the 90-day period set out in \u00a72101(c).IIOnly \u201ca genuinely final judgment\u201d\nwill trigger \u00a72101(c)\u2019s 90-day period for filing a petition for\ncertiorari in this Court.Hibbsv.Winn,542 U. S. 88, 98 (2004).\nIn most cases, the 90-day period begins to run immediately upon\nentry of a lower court\u2019s judgment. In some cases, though, the\nactions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a\njudgment and thereby reset the 90-day \u201cclock.\u201dIbid.For\ninstance, the timely filing of a petition for rehearing with the\nlower court or a lower court\u2019s appropriate decision to rehear an\nappeal may suspend the finality of a judgment by \u201crais[ing] the\nquestion whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the\nparties\u2019 rights.\u201dIbid.(citingMissouriv.Jenkins,495\nU. S. 33, 46 (1990)). So long as that question remains open,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018there is no \u201cjudgment\u201d to be reviewed,\u2019\u00a0\u201dHibbs,\nsupra,at 98 (quotingJenkins, supra, at 46), and\n\u00a72101(c)\u2019s 90-day period does not run.The same reasoning applies here.\nIn 2003, the Court of Appeals appropriately exercised discretionary\njurisdiction over the attorney general\u2019s appeal. See 48 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71424\u20132. By granting the petition for certiorari, the\nNinth Circuit raised the possibility that it might \u201cmodify the\njudgment\u201d or \u201calter the parties\u2019 rights.\u201dHibbs,supra, at 98. Thus, the Court of Appeals\u2019 grant of\ncertiorari suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment and prevented the 90-day clock from running while the case\nwas pending before the Court of Appeals. And until the Ninth\nCircuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained\npending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.The Governor argues that the judgment was made\nfinal earlier\u2014either when Congress enacted the statute depriving\nthe Court of Appeals of jurisdiction or when the Court of Appeals\ndecided inSantosthat the statute applied to pending\ncases. But when Congress removed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction\nover appeals from Guam, it did not dismiss this appeal. Likewise,\nwhen the Ninth Circuit determined inSantos, that Congress\nhad stripped its jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court did\nnot finally determine the rights of the parties in this case. The\njurisdiction-stripping statute andSantosmay have\nsignaled the Court of Appeals\u2019 ultimate dismissal of the appeal,\nbut neither created a final judgment in the still-pending case. The\nattorney general\u2019s appeal remained pending until the Ninth Circuit\nissued its dismissal order. And the pendency of the appeal\ncontinued to \u201craise the question whether\u201d any further action by the\ncourt might affect the relationship of the parties.Hibbs,supra, at 98. Accordingly, we hold that the judgment of\nthe Guam Supreme Court did not become final, for purposes of this\nCourt\u2019s review, until the Court of Appeals issued its order\ndismissing the appeal.We emphasize that our holding is limited to\nthe unique procedural circumstances presented here. Specifically,\nour holding does not extend to improperly filed appeals or filings\nused as delaying tactics. SeeMorsev.United\nStates,270 U.\nS. 151(1926) (holding that second application for leave to\nfile motion for new trial did not suspend the finality of the lower\ncourt\u2019s judgment).IIIHaving determined that we have\njurisdiction, we turn to the merits. As always, we begin with the\ntext of the statute. SeeNebraska Dept. of Revenuev.Loewenstein,513 U. S. 123, 128\n(1994). Guam\u2019s Organic Act states that \u201cno public indebtedness of\nGuam shall be authorized or allowed in excess of 10 per centum of\nthe aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam.\u201d 48 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71423a. The present dispute centers on the meaning of\nthe term \u201ctax valuation.\u201d In its unmodified form, the word\n\u201cvaluation\u201d means \u201c[t]he estimated worth of a thing.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1721 (4th ed. 1951) (hereinafter Black\u2019s). But as the\nparties\u2019 competing interpretations demonstrate, there are different\nsorts of valuations. An appraised valuation is the market value of\nproperty. Seeid.,at 129 (defining \u201cappraise\u201d as \u201cto fix\nand state the true value of a thing\u201d). By contrast, an \u201cassessed\nvaluation\u201d is the \u201c[v]alue on each unit of which a prescribed\namount must be paid as property taxes.\u201dId.,at 149. These\ntwo kinds of valuation are related in practice because a property\u2019s\nassessed valuation generally equals some percentage of its\nappraised valuation. See,e.g.,Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11,\n\u00a724102(f) (defining \u201cvalue\u201d as \u201cthirty-five per cent (35%) of the\nappraised value\u201d). The assessed valuation therefore could, but\ntypically does not, equal the market value of the property.Though it has no established\ndefinition, the term \u201ctax valuation\u201d most naturally means the value\nto which the tax rate is applied.[Footnote 2] Were it otherwise, the modifier \u201ctax\u201d would\nhave almost no meaning or a meaning inconsistent with ordinary\nusage. \u201cTax valuation\u201d therefore means \u201cassessed valuation\u201d\u2014a term\nconsistently defined as a valuation of property for purposes of\ntaxation. See Black\u2019s 149; see alsoid.,at 116 (6th ed.\n1990) (defining \u201cassessed valuation\u201d as \u201c[t]he worth or value of\nproperty established by taxing authorities on the basis of which\nthe tax rate is applied\u201d).One would not normally refer to a property\u2019s\nappraised valuation as its \u201ctax valuation.\u201d Appraised valuation is\nsimply market value. And market value may or may not relate to\ntaxation. Usually market value becomes relevant to taxation only\nbecause a specified percentage of market value is the assessed\nvalue to which taxing authorities apply the tax rate. It would\nstrain the text to conclude that \u201ctax valuation\u201d means a valuation\na step removed from taxation.The Guam Supreme Court reached a contrary\nconclusion by interpreting the word \u201ctax\u201d to limit the kinds of\nproperty that qualify for inclusion in the debt-limitation\ncalculation. But that interpretation impermissibly rearranges the\nstatutory language. The word \u201ctax\u201d modifies \u201cvaluation,\u201d not\n\u201cproperty.\u201d The phrase \u201ctax valuation\u201d therefore refers to the type\nof valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.The Guam Supreme Court also contrasted 48 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71423a\u2019s language with explicit references to \u201cassessed\nvaluation\u201d in the debt-limitation provision for the Virgin Islands.\nSee \u00a71403 (\u201caggregate assessed valuation\u201d). The court reasoned\nthat, by using language in \u00a71423a that differed from that used in\nthe Virgin Islands\u2019 debt-limitation provision, Congress expressed\nits intent to base Guam\u2019s debt limitation on something other than\nassessed value. We disagree. Certainly, Congress could have used\nthe term \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d But if Congress had meant actual,\nmarket, or appraised value, it could have used any one of those\nterms as well. SeeN.\u00a0W. Halsey & Co.v.Belle Plaine, 128 Iowa 467, 104 N.\u00a0W. 494 (1905)\n(interpreting debt-limitation provision using phrase \u201cactual\nvalue\u201d). Or it could have left the word \u201cvaluation\u201d unmodified:\nState courts interpreting other debt-limitation provisions have\nunderstood \u201cvaluation,\u201d standing alone, to mean the market or cash\nvalue of property. See,e.g.,Board of Education, Rich\nCty. School Dist.v.Passey, 122 Utah 102, 104\u2013106,\n246 P.\u00a02d 1078, 1079 (1952). At least in this context,\nCongress\u2019 rejection of \u201cassessed\u201d tells us no more than does its\nrejection of \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cappraised.\u201dOur interpretation comports with most States\u2019\npractice of tying the debt limitations of municipalities to\nassessed valuation. See 15 E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal\nCorporations \u00a741:7, p. 422 (3d ed. rev. 2005) (\u201cMost of the\nconstitutional and statutory provisions make the assessed value of\nthe taxable property of the municipality the basis for ascertaining\nthe amount of indebtedness which may be incurred\u00a0\u2026\u201d). States\nthat depart from the majority approach use clear language to do so.\nSeeid.,at 424\u2013425. (\u201cThe standard is generally the\nassessed value of the property for taxation, rather than the actual\nvalue, where the two are different; but where the constitution or\nstatute uses the term \u2018actual value,\u2019 such value governs rather\nthan the taxable value\u201d (citingN.\u00a0W. Halsey &\nCo.,supra;footnote omitted)). Congress has not used\nsuch language here. Indeed, as discussed earlier, only a strained\nreading of \u201ctax valuation\u201d would suggest a departure from the\nmajority approach.The Governor suggests that our interpretation\nwould result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may\narbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market\nvalue. For two reasons, we think the Governor has overstated this\nconcern. First, most States have long based their debt limitations\non assessed value without incident. Second, a strong political\ncheck exists; property-owning voters will not fail to notice if the\ngovernment sets the assessment rate above market value.Finally, the Governor mistakenly argues that\nwe owe deference to the Guam Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of its\nOrganic Act. It may be true that we accord deference to territorial\ncourts over matters of purely local concern. SeePernellv.Southall Realty,416 U. S. 363, 366\n(1974) (reviewing District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019\ninterpretation of D.\u00a0C. Code provision). This case does not\nfit that mold, however. The debt-limitation provision protects both\nGuamanians and the United States from the potential consequences of\nterritorial insolvency. Thus, this case is not a matter of purely\nlocal concern. Of course, decisions of the Supreme Court of Guam,\nas with other territorial courts, are instructive and are entitled\nto respect when they indicate how statutory issues, including the\nOrganic Act, apply to matters of local concern. On the other hand,\nthe Organic Act is a federal statute, which we are bound to\nconstrue according to its terms.IVFor the foregoing reasons, we\nreverse the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and remand the case\nfor proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1At the time suit was filed, Douglas Moylan\nserved as Guam\u2019s attorney general. Alicia Limtiaco has since been\nelected to the position, and she continues the case in Moylan\u2019s\nplace.Footnote 2The Guam Legislature passed a law attempting\nto define the term \u201ctax valuation.\u201d See Guam Code Ann., Tit. 11,\n\u00a724102(l),available at\nhttp://www.guamcourts.org/justicedocs/ (as visited Mar.\n16, 2007). But that term appears in Guam\u2019s Organic Act, which is a\nfederal statute. As the Guam Supreme Court correctly determined,\nGuam\u2019s territorial legislature cannot redefine terms used in a\nfederal statute.",
