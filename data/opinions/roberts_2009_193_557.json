S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-322NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTILITY DIS- TRICT\nNUMBER ONE, APPELLANTv.ERIC H. HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY\nGENERAL, et\u00a0al.on appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia[June 22, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.The plaintiff in this case is a\nsmall utility district raising a big question\u2014the constitutionality\nof \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act. The district has an elected board,\nand is required by \u00a75 to seek preclearance from federal authorities\nin Washington, D.\u00a0C., before it can change anything about\nthose elections. This is required even though there has never been\nany evidence of racial discrimination in voting in the\ndistrict.The district filed suit seeking relief from\nthese preclearance obligations under the \u201cbailout\u201d provision of the\nVoting Rights Act. That provision allows the release of a\n\u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d from the preclearance requirements if\ncertain rigorous conditions are met. The court below denied relief,\nconcluding that bailout was unavailable to a political subdivision\nlike the utility district that did not register its own voters. The\ndistrict appealed, arguing that the Act imposes no such limitation\non bailout, and that if it does, the preclearance requirements are\nunconstitutional.That constitutional question has attracted\nardent briefs from dozens of interested parties, but the importance\nof the question does not justify our rushing to decide it. Quite\nthe contrary: Our usual practice is to avoid the unnecessary\nresolution of constitutional questions. We agree that the district\nis eligible under the Act to seek bailout. We therefore reverse,\nand do not reach the constitutionality of \u00a75.IAThe Fifteenth Amendment promises\nthat the \u201cright of citizens of the United States to vote shall not\nbe denied or abridged \u2026 on account of race, color, or previous\ncondition of servitude.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, \u00a71. In addition to\nthat self-executing right, the Amendment also gives Congress the\n\u201cpower to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\u201d \u00a72. The\nfirst century of congressional enforcement of the Amendment,\nhowever, can only be regarded as a failure. Early enforcement Acts\nwere inconsistently applied and repealed with the rise of Jim Crow.South Carolinav.Katzenbach,383 U. S. 301, 310\n(1966); A. Keyssar, The Right to Vote 105\u2013111 (2000). Another\nseries of enforcement statutes in the 1950s and 1960s depended on\nindividual lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice. But\nlitigation is slow and expensive, and the States were creative in\n\u201ccontriving new rules\u201d to continue violating the Fifteenth\nAmendment \u201cin the face of adverse federal court decrees.\u201dKatzenbach,supra, at 335;Rileyv.Kennedy, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2).Congress responded with the\nVoting Rights Act. Section 2 of the Act operates nationwide; as it\nexists today, that provision forbids any \u201cstandard, practice, or\nprocedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of\nany citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(a). Section 2 is not at issue in\nthis case.The remainder of the Act constitutes a \u201cscheme\nof stringent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination\nhas been most flagrant.\u201dKatzenbach,supra, at\n315. Rather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litigation,\nthe Act directly pre-empted the most powerful tools of black\ndisenfranchisement in the covered areas. All literacy tests and\nsimilar voting qualifications were abolished by \u00a74 of the Act.\nVoting Rights Act of 1965, \u00a7\u00a74(a)\u2013(d), 79 Stat. 438\u2013439. Although\nsuch tests may have been facially neutral, they were easily\nmanipulated to keep blacks from voting. The Act also empowered\nfederal examiners to override state determinations about who was\neligible to vote. \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 9, 13,id.,at 439\u2013442,\n444\u2013445.These two remedies were bolstered by \u00a75, which\nsuspended all changes in state election procedure until they were\nsubmitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal District Court\nin Washington, D.\u00a0C., or the Attorney General.Id.,\nat 439, codified as amended at 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973c(a). Such\npreclearance is granted only if the change neither \u201chas the purpose\nnor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote\non account of race or color.\u201dIbid.We have interpreted\nthe requirements of \u00a75 to apply not only to the ballot-access\nrights guaranteed by \u00a74, but to drawing district lines as well.Allenv.State Bd. of Elections,393 U. S. 544, 564\u2013565\n(1969).To confine these remedies to areas of flagrant\ndisenfranchisement, the Act applied them only to States that had\nused a forbidden test or device in November 1964, and had less than\n50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential\nelection. \u00a74(b), 79 Stat. 438. Congress recognized that the\ncoverage formula it had adopted \u201cmight bring within its sweep\ngovernmental units not guilty of any unlawful discriminatory voting\npractices.\u201dBriscoev.Bell,432 U. S. 404, 411\n(1977). It therefore \u201cafforded such jurisdictions immediately\navailable protection in the form of \u2026 [a] \u2018bailout\u2019 suit.\u201dIbid.To bail out under the current provision, a\njurisdiction must seek a declaratory judgment from a three-judge\nDistrict Court in Washington, D.\u00a0C. 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1), 1973c(a). It must show that for the previous 10\nyears it has not used any forbidden voting test, has not been\nsubject to any valid objection under \u00a75, and has not been found\nliable for other voting rights violations; it must also show that\nit has \u201cengaged in constructive efforts to eliminate intimidation\nand harassment\u201d of voters, and similar measures.\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(A)\u2013(F). The Attorney General can consent to entry of\njudgment in favor of bailout if the evidence warrants it, though\nother interested parties are allowed to intervene in the\ndeclaratory judgment action. \u00a71973b(a)(9). There are other\nrestrictions: To bail out, a covered jurisdiction must show that\nevery jurisdiction in its territory has complied with all of these\nrequirements. \u00a71973b(a)(3). The District Court also retains\ncontinuing jurisdiction over a successful bailout suit for 10\nyears, and may reinstate coverage if any violation is found.\n\u00a71973b(a)(5).As enacted, \u00a7\u00a74 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act\nwere temporary provisions. They were expected to be in effect for\nonly five years. \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438. We upheld the temporary\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 as an appropriate exercise of\ncongressional power inKatzenbach, explaining that \u201c[t]he\nconstitutional propriety of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be\njudged with reference to the historical experience which it\nreflects.\u201d 383 U. S., at 308. We concluded that the problems\nCongress faced when it passed the Act were so dire that\n\u201cexceptional conditions [could] justify legislative measures not\notherwise appropriate.\u201dId.,at 334\u2013335 (citingHome\nBuilding & Loan Assn.v.Blaisdell,290 U. S. 398(1934),\nandWilsonv.New,243 U. S. 332(1917)).Congress reauthorized the Act in 1970 (for 5\nyears), 1975 (for 7 years), and 1982 (for 25 years). The coverage\nformula remained the same, based on the use of voting-eligibility\ntests and the rate of registration and turnout among all voters,\nbut the pertinent dates for assessing these criteria moved from\n1964 to include 1968 and eventually 1972. 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71973b(b). We upheld each of these reauthorizations against\nconstitutional challenges, finding that circumstances continued to\njustify the provisions.Georgiav.United States,411 U. S. 526(1973);City of Romev.United States,446 U. S. 156(1980);Lopezv.Monterey County,525 U. S. 266(1999).\nMost recently, in 2006, Congress extended \u00a75 for yet another 25\nyears. Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting\nRights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n577. The 2006 Act retained 1972 as the last baseline year for\ntriggering coverage under \u00a75. It is that latest extension that is\nnow before us.BNorthwest Austin Municipal\nUtility District Number One was created in 1987 to deliver city\nservices to residents of a portion of Travis County, Texas. It is\ngoverned by a board of five members, elected to staggered terms of\nfour years. The district does not register voters but is\nresponsible for its own elections; for administrative reasons,\nthose elections are run by Travis County. Because the district is\nlocated in Texas, it is subject to the obligations of \u00a75, although\nthere is no evidence that it has ever discriminated on the basis of\nrace.The district filed suit in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, seeking relief under\nthe statute\u2019s bailout provisions and arguing in the alternative\nthat, if interpreted to render the district ineligible for bailout,\n\u00a75 was unconstitutional. The three-judge District Court rejected\nboth claims. Under the statute, only a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision\u201d is permitted to seek bailout, 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71973b(a)(1)(A), and the court concluded that the district was not\na political subdivision because that term includes only \u201ccounties,\nparishes, and voter-registering subunits,\u201dNorthwest Austin\nMunicipal Util. Dist. No. Onev.Mukasey, 573\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d 221, 232 (2008). Turning to the district\u2019s\nconstitutional challenge, the court concluded that the 25-year\nextension of \u00a75 was constitutional both because \u201cCongress \u2026\nrationally concluded that extending [\u00a7]5 was necessary to protect\nminorities from continued racial discrimination in voting\u201d and\nbecause \u201cthe 2006 Amendment qualifies as a congruent and\nproportional response to the continuing problem of racial\ndiscrimination in voting.\u201dId.,at 283. We noted probable\njurisdiction, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now reverse.IIThe historic accomplishments of\nthe Voting Rights Act are undeniable. When it was first passed,\nunconstitutional discrimination was rampant and the \u201cregistration\nof voting-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more\nahead\u201d of black registration in many covered States.Katzenbach,supra, at 313; H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, p.\u00a012 (2006). Today, the registration gap between\nwhite and black voters is in single digits in the covered States;\nin some of those States, blacks now register and vote at higher\nrates than whites.Id.,at 12\u201313. Similar dramatic\nimprovements have occurred for other racial minorities.Id.,at 18\u201320. \u201c[M]any of the first generation barriers to\nminority voter registration and voter turnout that were in place\nprior to the [Voting Rights Act] have been eliminated.\u201dId.,at 12;Bartlettv.Strickland,556 U. S. 1, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 5) (plurality opinion) (\u201cPassage of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965 was an important step in the struggle to end\ndiscriminatory treatment of minorities who seek to exercise one of\nthe most fundamental rights of our citizens: the right to\nvote\u201d).At the same time, \u00a75, \u201cwhich\nauthorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state and\nlocal policymaking, imposes substantial \u2018federalism costs.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nLopez,supra, at 282 (quotingMillerv.Johnson,515 U. S. 900, 926 (1995)). These\nfederalism costs have caused Members of this Court to express\nserious misgivings about the constitutionality of \u00a75.Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 358\u2013362 (Black, J., concurring\nand dissenting);Allen, 393 U. S., at 586, n.\u00a04\n(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);Georgia,supra, at 545 (Powell, J., dissenting);City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 209\u2013221 (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting);id.,at 200\u2013206 (Powell, J., dissenting);Lopez, 525 U. S., at 293\u2013298 (Thomas, J., dissenting);id.,at 288 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).Section 5 goes beyond the prohibition of the\nFifteenth Amendment by suspendingallchanges to state\nelection law\u2014however innocuous\u2014until they have been precleared by\nfederal authorities in Washington, D. C. The preclearance\nrequirement applies broadly,NAACPv.Hampton County\nElection Comm\u2019n,470 U. S. 166, 175\u2013176\n(1985), and in particular to every political subdivision in a\ncovered State, no matter how small,United Statesv.Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs,435 U. S. 110, 117\u2013118 (1978).Some of the conditions that we relied upon in\nupholding this statutory scheme inKatzenbachandCity\nof Romehave unquestionably improved. Things have changed in\nthe South. Voter turnout and registration rates now approach\nparity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are\nrare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\nSee generally H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at 12\u201318.These improvements are no doubt due in\nsignificant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a\nmonument to its success. Past success alone, however, is not\nadequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements. See\nIssacharoff, Is Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act a Victim of Its\nOwn Success? 104 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1710 (2004). It may be that\nthese improvements are insufficient and that conditions continue to\nwarrant preclearance under the Act. But the Act imposes current\nburdens and must be justified by current needs.The Act also differentiates between the\nStates, despite our historic tradition that all the States enjoy\n\u201cequal sovereignty.\u201dUnited Statesv.Louisiana,363 U. S. 1, 16\n(1960) (citingLessee of Pollardv.Hagan, 3 How.\n212, 223 (1845)); see alsoTexasv.White, 7\nWall. 700, 725\u2013726 (1869). Distinctions can be justified in some\ncases. \u201cThe doctrine of the equality of States \u2026 does not bar \u2026\nremedies forlocalevils which have subsequently\nappeared.\u201dKatzenbach,supra, at 328\u2013329\n(emphasis added). But a departure from the fundamental principle of\nequal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\u2019s disparate\ngeographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it\ntargets.These federalism concerns are underscored by\nthe argument that the preclearance requirements in one State would\nbe unconstitutional in another. SeeGeorgiav.Ashcroft,539 U. S. 461, 491\u2013492\n(2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201cRace cannot be the predominant\nfactor in redistricting under our decision inMillerv.Johnson,515 U. S. 900(1995). Yet\nconsiderations of race that would doom a redistricting plan under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment or \u00a72 seem to be what save it under \u00a75\u201d).\nAdditional constitutional concerns are raised in saying that this\ntension between \u00a7\u00a72 and 5 must persist in covered jurisdictions and\nnot elsewhere.The evil that \u00a75 is meant to address may no\nlonger be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for\npreclearance. The statute\u2019s coverage formula is based on data that\nis now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence\nthat it fails to account for current political conditions. For\nexample, the racial gap in voter registration and turnout is lower\nin the States originally covered by \u00a75 than it is nationwide. E.\nBlum & L. Campbell, Assessment of Voting Rights Progress in\nJurisdictions Covered Under Section Five of the Voting Rights Act\n3\u20136 (American Enterprise Institute, 2006). Congress heard warnings\nfrom supporters of extending \u00a75 that the evidence in the record did\nnot address \u201csystematic differences between the covered and the\nnon-covered areas of the United States[,] \u2026 and, in fact, the\nevidence that is in the record suggests that there is more\nsimilarity than difference.\u201d The Continuing Need for Section 5\nPre-Clearance: Hearing before the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (2006) (statement of Richard\nH. Pildes); see also Persily, The Promise and Pitfalls of the New\nVoting Rights Act, 117 Yale L.\u00a0J. 174, 208 (2007) (\u201cThe most\none can say in defense of the [coverage] formula is that it is the\nbest of the politically feasible alternatives or that changing the\nformula would \u2026 disrupt settled expectations\u201d).The parties do not agree on the standard to\napply in deciding whether, in light of the foregoing concerns,\nCongress exceeded its Fifteenth Amendment enforcement power in\nextending the preclearance requirements. The district argues that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between\nthe injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to\nthat end,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Appellant 31, quotingCity of\nBoernev.Flores,521 U. S. 507, 520\n(1997); the Federal Government asserts that it is enough that the\nlegislation be a \u201c\u00a0\u2018rational means to effectuate the\nconstitutional prohibition,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Federal Appellee 6,\nquotingKatzenbach,supra, at 324. That question\nhas been extensively briefed in this case, but we need not resolve\nit. The Act\u2019s preclearance requirements and its coverage formula\nraise serious constitutional questions under either test.In assessing those questions, we are keenly\nmindful of our institutional role. We fully appreciate that judging\nthe constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe gravest and\nmost delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.\u201dBlodgettv.Holden,275 U. S. 142, 147\u2013148\n(1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). \u201cThe Congress is a coequal branch\nof government whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold the\nConstitution of the United States.\u201dRostkerv.Goldberg,453 U. S. 57, 64 (1981).\nThe Fifteenth Amendment empowers \u201cCongress,\u201d not the Court, to\ndetermine in the first instance what legislation is needed to\nenforce it. Congress amassed a sizable record in support of its\ndecision to extend the preclearance requirements, a record the\nDistrict Court determined \u201cdocument[ed] contemporary racial\ndiscrimination in covered states.\u201d 573 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 265.\nThe District Court also found that the record \u201cdemonstrat[ed] that\nsection 5 prevents discriminatory voting changes\u201d by \u201cquietly but\neffectively deterring discriminatory changes.\u201dId.,at\n264.We will not shrink from our duty \u201cas the\nbulwar[k] of a limited constitution against legislative\nencroachments,\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 526 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)\n(A. Hamilton), but \u201c[i]t is a well-established principle governing\nthe prudent exercise of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction that normally the\nCourt will not decide a constitutional question if there is some\nother ground upon which to dispose of the case,\u201dEscambia\nCountyv.McMillan,466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984)\n(per curiam). Here, the district also raises a statutory\nclaim that it is eligible to bail out under \u00a7\u00a74 and\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas argues that the principle of\nconstitutional avoidance has no pertinence here. He contends that\neven if we resolve the district\u2019s statutory argument in its favor,\nwe would still have to reach the constitutional question, because\nthe district\u2019s statutory argument would not afford it all the\nrelief it seeks.Post, at 1\u20133 (opinion concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part).We disagree. The district expressly describes\nits constitutional challenge to \u00a75 as being \u201cin the alternative\u201d to\nits statutory argument. See Brief for Appellant 64 (\u201c[T]he Court\nshould reverse the judgment of the district court and render\njudgment that the district is entitled to use the bailout procedure\nor, in the alternative, that \u00a75 cannot be constitutionally applied\nto the district\u201d). The district\u2019s counsel confirmed this at oral\nargument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[Question:] [D]o you\nacknowledge that if we find in your favor on the bailout point we\nneed not reach the constitutional point? [Answer:] I do acknowledge\nthat\u201d). We therefore turn to the district\u2019s statutory argument.IIISection 4(b) of the Voting Rights\nAct authorizes a bailout suit by a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973b(a)(1)(A). There is no dispute\nthat the district is a political subdivision of the State of Texas\nin the ordinary sense of the term. See,e.g., Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1197 (8th ed. 2004) (\u201cA division of a state that exists\nprimarily to discharge some function of local government\u201d). The\ndistrict was created under Texas law with \u201cpowers of government\u201d\nrelating to local utilities and natural resources. Tex. Const.,\nArt. XVI, \u00a759(b); Tex. Water Code Ann. \u00a754.011 (West 2002); see\nalsoBennettv.Brown Cty. Water Improvement Dist. No.\n1, 272 S.\u00a0W. 2d 498, 500 (Tex. 1954) (\u201c[W]ater\nimprovement district[s] \u2026 are held to be political subdivisions of\nthe State\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).The Act, however, also provides a\nnarrower statutory definition in \u00a714(c)(2): \u201c\u00a0\u2018[P]olitical\nsubdivision\u2019 shall mean any county or parish, except that where\nregistration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a\ncounty or parish, the term shall include any other subdivision of a\nState which conducts registration for voting.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71973l(c)(2). The District Court concluded that this\ndefinition applied to the bailout provision in \u00a74(a), and that the\ndistrict did not qualify, since it is not a county or parish and\ndoes not conduct its own voter registration.\u201cStatutory definitions control the meaning of\nstatutory words, of course, in the usual case. But this is an\nunusual case.\u201dLawsonv.Suwannee Fruit & S. S.\nCo.,336 U. S.\n198, 201 (1949); see alsoFarmers Reservoir &\nIrrigation Co.v.McComb,337 U. S. 755, 764\n(1949);Philko Aviation, Inc.v.Shacket,462 U. S. 406,\n412 (1983). Were the scope of \u00a74(a) considered in isolation from\nthe rest of the statute and our prior cases, the District Court\u2019s\napproach might well be correct. But here specific precedent, the\nstructure of the Voting Rights Act, and underlying constitutional\nconcerns compel a broader reading of the bailout provision.Importantly, we do not write on a blank slate.\nOur decisions have already established that the statutory\ndefinition in \u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the term\n\u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the Act. We have, for example, concluded\nthat the definition does not apply to the preclearance obligation\nof \u00a75. According to its text, \u00a75 applies only \u201c[w]henever a\n[covered] State or political subdivision\u201d enacts or administers a\nnew voting practice. Yet inSheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs,435 U. S. 110, we rejected the\nargument by a Texas city that it was neither a State nor a\npolitical subdivision as defined in the Act, and therefore did not\nneed to seek preclearance of a voting change. The dissent agreed\nwith the city, pointing out that the city did not meet the\nstatutory definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d and therefore could\nnot be covered.Id.,at 141\u2013144 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\nThe majority, however, relying on the purpose and structure of the\nAct, concluded that the \u201cdefinition was intended to operate only\nfor purposes of determining which political units in nondesignated\nStates may be separately designated for coverage under \u00a74(b).\u201dId.,at 128\u2013129; see alsoid.,at 130, n.\u00a018\n(\u201cCongress\u2019s exclusive objective in \u00a714(c)(2) was to limit the\njurisdictions which may be separately designated for coverage under\n\u00a74(b)\u201d).We reaffirmed this restricted scope of the\nstatutory definition the next Term inDougherty County Bd. of\nEd.v.White,439 U. S. 32(1978).\nThere, a school board argued that because \u201cit d[id] not meet the\ndefinition\u201d of political subdivision in \u00a714(c)(2), it \u201cd[id] not\ncome within the purview of \u00a75.\u201dId.,at 43, 44. We\nresponded:\u201cThis contention is squarely\nforeclosed by our decision last Term in [Sheffield].\nThere, we expressly rejected the suggestion that the city of\nSheffield was beyond the ambit of \u00a75 because it did not itself\nregister voters and hence was not a political subdivision as the\nterm is defined in \u00a714(c)(2) of the Act. \u2026 [O]nce a State has been\ndesignated for coverage, \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s definition of political\nsubdivision has no operative significance in determining the reach\nof \u00a75.\u201dId.,at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).According to these decisions,\nthen, the statutory definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in\n\u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the term \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d in the Act. Even the intervenors who oppose the\ndistrict\u2019s bailout concede, for example, that the definition should\nnot apply to \u00a72, which bans racial discrimination in voting by \u201cany\nState or political subdivision,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(a). See\nBrief for Intervenor-Appellee Texas State Conference of NAACP\nBranches et al. 17 (citingSmithv.Salt River Project\nAgricultural Improvement and Power Dist.,109 F.\u00a03d 586,\n592\u2013593 (CA9 1997)); see alsoUnited Statesv.Uvalde\nConsol. Independent School Dist., 625 F.\u00a02d 547, 554 (CA5\n1980) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has held that this definition [in\n\u00a714(c)(2)] limits the meaning of the phrase \u2018State or political\nsubdivision\u2019 only when it appears in certain parts of the Act, and\nthat it does not confine the phrase as used elsewhere in the Act\u201d).\nIn light of our holdings that the statutory definition does not\nconstrict the scope of preclearance required by \u00a75, the district\nargues, it only stands to reason that the definition should not\nconstrict the availability of bailout from those preclearance\nrequirements either.The Government responds that any such argument\nis foreclosed by our interpretation of the statute inCity of\nRome,446 U. S. 156. There, it argues, we\nmade clear that the discussion of political subdivisions inSheffieldwas dictum, and \u201cspecifically held that a \u2018city\nis not a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d for purposes of \u00a74(a)\nbailout.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Federal Appellee 14 (quotingCity of\nRome,supra, at 168).Even if that is whatCity of Romeheld, the premises of its statutory holding did not survive later\nchanges in the law. InCity of Romewe rejected the city\u2019s\nattempt to bail out from coverage under \u00a75, concluding that\n\u201cpolitical units of a covered jurisdiction cannot independently\nbring a \u00a74(a) bailout action.\u201d 446 U. S., at 167. We concluded that\nthe statute as then written authorized a bailout suit only by a\n\u201cState\u201d subject to the coverage formula, or a \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision with respect to which [coverage] determinations have\nbeen made as a separate unit,\u201did.,at 164, n.\u00a02\n(quoting 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973b(a) (1976 ed.)); see also 446 U.\nS., at 163\u2013169. Political subdivisions covered because they were\npart of a covered State, rather than because of separate coverage\ndeterminations, could not separately bail out. As Justice Stevens\nput it, \u201c[t]he political subdivisions of a covered State\u201d were \u201cnot\nentitled to bail out in a piecemeal fashion.\u201dId.,at 192\n(concurring opinion).In 1982, however, Congress expressly\nrepudiatedCity of Romeand instead embraced \u201cpiecemeal\u201d\nbailout. As part of an overhaul of the bailout provision, Congress\namended the Voting Rights Act to expressly provide that bailout was\nalso available to \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d in a covered State,\n\u201cthough [coverage] determinations werenotmade with\nrespect to such subdivision as a separate unit.\u201d Voting Rights Act\nAmendments of 1982, 96 Stat. 131, codified at 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71973b(a)(1) (emphasis added). In other words, Congress decided\nthat a jurisdiction covered because it was within a covered State\nneed not remain covered for as long as the State did. If the\nsubdivision met the bailout requirements, it could bail out, even\nif the State could not. In light of these amendments, our logic for\ndenying bailout inCity of Romeis no longer applicable to\nthe Voting Rights Act\u2014if anything, that logic compels the opposite\nconclusion.Bailout and preclearance under \u00a75 are now\ngoverned by a principle of symmetry. \u201cGiven the Court\u2019s decision inSheffieldthat all political units in a covered State are\nto be treated for \u00a75 purposes as though they were \u2018political\nsubdivisions\u2019 of that State, it follows that they should also be\ntreated as such for purposes of \u00a74(a)\u2019s bailout provisions.\u201dCity of Rome,supra, at 192 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring).The Government contends that this reading ofSheffieldis mistaken, and that the district is subject to\n\u00a75 under our decision inSheffieldnot because it is a\n\u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d but because it is a \u201cState.\u201d That would\nmean it could bail out only if the whole State could bail out.The assertion that the district is a State is\nat least counterintuitive. We acknowledge, however, that there has\nbeen much confusion over whySheffieldheld the city in\nthat case to be covered by the text of \u00a75. SeeCity of\nRome, 446 U. S., at 168\u2013169;id.,at 192 (Stevens,\nJ., concurring); see alsoUvalde Consol. Independent School\nDist.v.United States,451 U. S. 1002, 1004,\nn.\u00a04 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari) (\u201c[T]his Court has not yet settled on the proper\nconstruction of the term \u2018political subdivision\u2019\u00a0\u201d).But after the 1982 amendments, the\nGovernment\u2019s position is untenable. If the district is considered\nthe State, and therefore necessarily subject to preclearance so\nlong as Texas is covered, then the same must be true of all other\nsubdivisions of the State, including counties. That would render\neven counties unable to seek bailout so long as their State was\ncovered. But that is the very restriction the 1982 amendments\noverturned. Nobody denies that counties in a covered State can seek\nbailout, as several of them have. See Voting Rights Act: Section 5\nof the Act\u2014History, Scope, and Purpose: Hearing Before the\nSubcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 2599\u20132834 (2005) (detailing\nbailouts). Because such piecemeal bailout is now permitted, it\ncannot be true that \u00a75 treats every governmental unit as the State\nitself.The Government\u2019s contrary interpretation has\nhelped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity. Since\n1982, only 17 jurisdictions\u2014out of the more than 12,000 covered\npolitical subdivisions\u2014have successfully bailed out of the Act.\nApp. to Brief for Jurisdictions That Have Bailed Out asAmici\nCuriae3; Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Census of\nGovernments, Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 1, 22\u201360. It is unlikely that\nCongress intended the provision to have such limited effect. SeeUnited Statesv.Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ____\n(2009) (slip op., at 10).We therefore hold that all political\nsubdivisions\u2014not only those described in \u00a714(c)(2)\u2014are eligible to\nfile a bailout suit.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*More than 40 years ago, this\nCourt concluded that \u201cexceptional conditions\u201d prevailing in certain\nparts of the country justified extraordinary legislation otherwise\nunfamiliar to our federal system.Katzenbach, 383 U. S.,\nat 334. In part due to the success of that legislation, we are now\na very different Nation. Whether conditions continue to justify\nsuch legislation is a difficult constitutional question we do not\nanswer today. We conclude instead that the Voting Rights Act\npermits all political subdivisions, including the district in this\ncase, to seek relief from its preclearance requirements.The judgment of the District\nCourt is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
