    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTGRANITE ROCK CO. V. TEAMSTERS561 U. S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-1214GRANITE ROCK COMPANY, PETITIONERv.INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[June 24, 2010]Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case involves an employer\u2019s\nclaims against a local union and the union\u2019s international parent\nfor economic damages arising out of a 2004 strike. The claims turn\nin part on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)\ncontaining a no-strike provision was validly formed during the\nstrike period. The employer contends that it was, while the unions\ncontend that it was not. Because the CBA contains an arbitration\nclause, we first address whether the parties\u2019 dispute over the\nCBA\u2019s ratification date was a matter for the District Court or an\narbitrator to resolve. We conclude that it was a matter for\njudicial resolution. Next, we address whether the Court of Appeals\nerred in declining the employer\u2019s request to recognize a new\nfederal cause of action under \u00a7301(a) of the Labor Management\nRelations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7185(a),\nfor the international union\u2019s alleged tortious interference with\nthe CBA. The Court of Appeals did not err in declining this\nrequest.IPetitioner Granite Rock Company\nis a concrete and building materials company that has operated in\nCalifornia since 1900. Granite Rock employs approximately 800\nemployees under different labor contracts with several unions,\nincluding respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local\n287 (Local). Granite Rock and Local were parties to a 1999 CBA that\nexpired in April 2004. The parties\u2019 attempt to negotiate a new CBA\nhit an impasse and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a\nstrike in support of their contract demands.[Footnote 1]The strike continued until July\n2, 2004, when the parties reached agreement on the terms of a new\nCBA. The CBA contained a no-strike clause but did not directly\naddress union members\u2019 liability for any strike-related damages\nGranite Rock may have incurred before the new CBA was negotiated\nbut after the prior CBA had expired. At the end of the negotiating\nsession on the new CBA, Local\u2019s business representative, George\nNetto, approached Granite Rock about executing a separate\n\u201cback-to-work\u201d agreement that would, among other things, hold union\nmembers harmless for damages incurred during the June 2004 strike.\nNetto did not make execution of such an agreement a condition of\nLocal\u2019s ratification of the CBA, or of Local\u2019s decision to cease\npicketing. Thus, Local did not have a back-to-work or hold-harmless\nagreement in place when it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2,\n2004.Respondent International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters (IBT), which had advised Local throughout the CBA\nnegotiations and whose leadership and members supported the June\nstrike, opposed Local\u2019s decision to return to work without a\nback-to-work agreement shielding both Local and IBT members from\nliability for strike-related damages. In an effort to secure such\nan agreement, IBT instructed Local\u2019s members not to honor their\nagreement to return to work on July 5, and instructed Local\u2019s\nleaders to continue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to\nhold Local and IBT members free from liability for the June strike.\nNetto demanded such an agreement on July 6, but Granite Rock\nrefused the request and informed Local that the company would view\nany continued strike activity as a violation of the new CBA\u2019s\nno-strike clause. IBT and Local responded by announcing a\ncompany-wide strike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds\nof workers, including members of IBT locals besides Local 287.According to Granite Rock, IBT not only\ninstigated this strike; it supported and directed it. IBT provided\npay and benefits to union members who refused to return to work,\ndirected Local\u2019s negotiations with Granite Rock, supported Local\nfinancially during the strike period with a $1.2 million loan, and\nrepresented to Granite Rock that IBT had unilateral authority to\nend the work stoppage in exchange for a hold-harmless agreement\ncovering IBT members within and outside Local\u2019s bargaining\nunit.On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and\nLocal in the District Court, seeking an injunction against the\nongoing strike and strike-related damages. Granite Rock\u2019s\ncomplaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal jurisdiction\nunder LMRA \u00a7301(a), alleged that the July 6 strike violated Local\u2019s\nobligations under the CBA\u2019s no-strike provision, and asked the\nDistrict Court to enjoin the strike because the hold-harmless\ndispute giving rise to the strike was an arbitrable grievance. SeeBoys Markets, Inc.v.Retail Clerks,398 U. S. 235, 237\u2013238,\n253\u2013254 (1970) (holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike\nwhere a CBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occasions\nthe strike). The unions conceded that LMRA \u00a7301(a) gave the\nDistrict Court jurisdiction over the suit but opposed Granite\nRock\u2019s complaint, asserting that the CBA was not validly ratified\non July 2 (or at any other time relevant to the July 2004 strike)\nand, thus, its no-strike clause did not provide a basis for Granite\nRock\u2019s claims challenging the strike.The District Court initially denied Granite\nRock\u2019s request to enforce the CBA\u2019s no-strike provision because\nGranite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the CBA was\nratified on July 2. App. 203\u2013213. Shortly after the District Court\nruled, however, a Local member testified that Netto had put the new\nCBA to a ratification vote on July 2, and that the voting Local\nmembers unanimously approved the agreement. Based on this statement\nand supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Granite Rock\nmoved for a new trial on its injunction and damages claims.On August 22, while that motion was pending,\nLocal conducted a second successful \u201cratification\u201d vote on the CBA,\nand on September 13, the day the District Court was scheduled to\nhear Granite Rock\u2019s motion, the unions called off their strike.\nAlthough their return to work mooted Granite Rock\u2019s request for an\ninjunction, the District Court proceeded with the hearing and\ngranted Granite Rock a new trial on its damages claims. The parties\nproceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its complaint,\nwhich already alleged federal[Footnote 2] claims for breach of the CBA against both\nLocal and IBT, to add federal inducement of breach and interference\nwith contract (hereinafter tortious interference) claims against\nIBT.IBT and Local both moved to dismiss. Among\nother things, IBT argued that Granite Rock could not plead a\nfederal tort claim under \u00a7301(a) because that provision supports a\nfederal cause of action only for breach of contract. The District\nCourt agreed and dismissed Granite Rock\u2019s tortious interference\nclaims. The District Court did not, however, grant Local\u2019s separate\nmotion to send the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate to arbitration.[Footnote\n3] The District Court held that whether the CBA was ratified on\nJuly 2 or August 22 was an issue for the court to decide, and\nsubmitted the question to a jury. The jury reached a unanimous\nverdict that Local ratified the CBA on July 2, 2004. The District\nCourt entered the verdict and ordered the parties to proceed with\narbitration on Granite Rock\u2019s breach-of-contract claims for\nstrike-related damages.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed in part and reversed in part. See 546 F.\u00a03d 1169\n(2008). The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s\ndismissal of Granite Rock\u2019s tortious interference claims against\nIBT. Seeid., at 1170\u20131175. But it disagreed with the\nDistrict Court\u2019s determination that the date of the CBA\u2019s\nratification was a matter for judicial resolution. Seeid., at 1176\u20131178. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the\nparties\u2019 dispute over this issue was governed by the CBA\u2019s\narbitration clause because the clause clearly covered the related\nstrike claims, the \u201cnational policy favoring arbitration\u201d required\nthat any ambiguity about the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration\nclause be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and, in any event,\nGranite Rock had \u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitrate the\nratification-date dispute \u201cby suing under the contract.\u201dId., at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\ngranted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).IIIt is well settled in both\ncommercial and labor cases that whether parties have agreed to\n\u201csubmi[t] a particular dispute to arbitration\u201d is typically an\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0issue for judicial determination.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHowsamv.Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002)\n(quotingAT&T Technologies, Inc.v.Communications\nWorkers,475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986)); seeJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.v.Livingston,376 U. S. 543,\n546\u2013547 (1964). It is similarly well settled that where the dispute\nat issue concerns contract formation, the dispute is generally for\ncourts to decide. See,e.g.,First Options of Chicago,\nInc.v.Kaplan,514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995) (\u201cWhen\ndeciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter \u2026\ncourts generally \u2026 should apply ordinary \u2026 principles that govern\nthe formation of contracts\u201d);AT&T Technologies,supra, at 648\u2013649 (explaining the settled rule in labor\ncases that \u201c\u00a0\u2018arbitration is a matter of contract\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201carbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only\nbecause the parties have agreed in advance to submit such\ngrievances to arbitration\u201d);Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.v.Cardegna,546 U. S. 440, 444, n.\u00a01 (2006)\n(distinguishing treatment of the generally nonarbitral question\nwhether an arbitration agreement was \u201cever concluded\u201d from the\nquestion whether a contract con- taining an arbitration clause was\nillegal when formed, which question we held to be arbitrable in\ncertain circumstances).These principles would neatly\ndispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical.\nBut it is not. It is based on when (not whether) the CBA that\ncontains the parties\u2019 arbitration clause was ratified and thereby\nformed.[Footnote 4] And at the\ntime the District Court considered Local\u2019s demand to send this\nissue to an arbitrator, Granite Rock, the party resisting\narbitration, conceded both the formation and the validity of the\nCBA\u2019s arbitration clause.These unusual facts require us to reemphasize\nthe proper framework for deciding when disputes are arbitrable\nunder our precedents. Under that framework, a court may order\narbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is\nsatisfied that the parties agreed to arbitratethat\ndispute. SeeFirst Options,supra, at 943;AT&T Technologies,supra, at 648\u2013649. To\nsatisfy itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve\nany issue that calls into question the formation or applicability\nof the specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have the\ncourt enforce. See,e.g.,Rent-A-Center, West,\nInc.v.Jackson,ante, at 4\u20136 (opinion of\nScalia, J.). Where there is no provision validly committing them to\nan arbitrator, seeante, at 7, these issues typically\nconcern the scope of the arbitration clause and its enforceability.\nIn addition, these issues always include whether the clause was\nagreed to, and may include when that agreement was formed.AThe parties agree that it was\nproper for the District Court to decide whether their ratification\ndispute was arbitrable.[Footnote\n5] They disagree about whether the District Court answered the\nquestion correctly. Local contends that the District Court erred in\nholding that the CBA\u2019s ratification date was an issue for the court\nto decide. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the District\nCourt\u2019s refusal to send that dispute to arbitration violated two\nprinciples of arbitrability set forth in our precedents. See 546\nF.\u00a03d, at 1177\u20131178. The first principle is that where, as\nhere, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitratesomematters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the \u201claw\u2019s\npermissive policies in respect to arbitration\u201d counsel that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues\nshould be resolved in favor of arbitration.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFirst\nOptions,supra, at 945 (quotingMitsubishi Motors\nCorp.v.Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U. S. 614, 626\n(1985)); see 546 F.\u00a03d, at 1177\u20131178 (citing this principle\nand the \u201cnational policy favoring arbitration\u201d in concluding that\narbitration clauses \u201care to be construed very broadly\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted)). The second principle the\nCourt of Appeals invoked is that this presumption of arbitrability\napplies even to disputes about the enforceability of the entire\ncontract containing the arbitration clause, because at least in\ncases governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a71et seq.,[Footnote 6] courts must treat the arbitration clause as\nseverable from the contract in which it appears, and thus apply the\nclause to all disputes within its scope \u201c\u00a0\u2018[u]nless \u00a0the\n[validity] challenge is to the arbitration clause itself\u2019\u00a0\u201d or\nthe party \u201cdisputes the formation of [the] contract,\u201d 546\nF.\u00a03d, at 1176 (quotingBuckeye, 546 U. S., at\n445\u2013446); 546 F.\u00a03d, at 1177, and n.\u00a04 (explaining that\nit would treat the parties\u2019 arbitration clause as enforceable with\nrespect to the ratification-date dispute because no party argued\nthat the \u201cclause is invalid in any way\u201d)).Local contends that our\nprecedents, particularly those applying the \u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0federal\npolicy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\u2019\u00a0\u201d permit no\nother result. Brief for Respondent Local, p.\u00a015 (quotingGateway Coal Co.v.Mine Workers,414 U. S. 368, 377 (1974)); see Brief\nfor Respondent Local, pp. 10\u201313; 16\u201325. Local, like the Court of\nAppeals, overreads our precedents. The language and holdings on\nwhich Local and the Court of Appeals rely cannot be divorced from\nthe first principle that underscores all of our arbitration\ndecisions: Arbitration is strictly \u201ca matter of consent,\u201dVolt\nInformation Sciences, Inc.v.Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ.,489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989), and thus \u201cis a way to resolve those disputes\u2014but only\nthose disputes\u2014that the parties have agreed to submit to\narbitration,\u201dFirst Options, 514 U. S., at 943 (emphasis\nadded).[Footnote 7] Applying\nthis principle, our precedents hold that courts should order\narbitration of a dispute only where the court is satisfied that\nneither the formation of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreementnor(absent a valid provision specifically committing such\ndisputes to an arbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to\nthe dispute is in issue.Ibid. Where a party contests\neither or both matters, \u201cthe court\u201d must resolve the disagreement.Ibid.Local nonetheless interprets some of our\nopinions to depart from this framework and to require arbitration\nof certain disputes, particularly labor disputes, based on policy\ngrounds even where evidence of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate\nthe dispute in question is lacking. See Brief for Respondent Local,\np.\u00a016 (citing cases emphasizing the policy favoring\narbitration generally and the \u201cimpressive policy considerations\nfavoring arbitration\u201d in LMRA cases (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). That is not a fair reading of the opinions, all of which\ncompelled arbitration of a dispute only after the Court was\npersuaded that the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement was validly\nformed and that it covered the dispute in question and was legally\nenforceable. See,e.g.,First Options,supra, at 944\u2013945. ThatBuckeyeand some of our\ncases applying a presumption of arbitrability to certain disputes\ndo not discuss each of these requirements merely reflects the fact\nthat in those cases some of the requirements were so obviously\nsatisfied that no discussion was needed.InBuckeye, the formation of the\nparties\u2019 arbitration agreement was not at issue because the parties\nagreed that they had \u201cconcluded\u201d an agreement to arbitrate and\nmemorialized it as an arbitration clause in their loan contract.\n546 U. S., at 444, n.\u00a01. The arbitration clause\u2019s scope was\nalso not at issue, because the provision expressly applied to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]ny claim, dispute, or controversy \u2026 arising from or\nrelating to \u2026 the validity, enforceability, or scope of this\nArbitration Provision or the entire Agreement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 442. The parties resisting arbitration (customers\nwho agreed to the broad arbitration clause as a condition of using\nBuckeye\u2019s loan service) claimed only that a usurious interest\nprovision in the loan agreement invalidated the entire contract,\nincluding the arbitration clause, and thus precluded the Court from\nrelying on the clause as evidence of the parties\u2019 consent to\narbitrate matters within its scope. Seeid., at 443. In\nrejecting this argument, we simply applied the requirement in \u00a72 of\nthe FAA that courts treat an arbitration clause as severable from\nthe contract in which it appears and enforce it according to its\nterms unless the party resisting arbitration specifically\nchallenges the enforceability of the arbitration clause itself, seeid., at 443\u2013445 (citing 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72;Southland\nCorp.v.Keating,465 U. S. 1, 4\u20135 (1984);Prima Paint Corp.v.Flood & Conklin Mfg.\nCo.,388 U. S.\n395, 402\u2013404 (1967)), or claims that the agreement to arbitrate\nwas \u201c[n]ever concluded,\u201d 546 U. S., at 444, n.\u00a01; see alsoRent-A-Center, ante,at 6\u20137, and n.\u00a02.Our cases invoking the federal \u201cpolicy\nfavoring arbitration\u201d of commercial and labor disputes apply the\nsame framework. They recognize that, except where \u201cthe parties\nclearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,\u201dAT&T\nTechnologies, 475 U. S., at 649, it is \u201cthe court\u2019s duty to\ninterpret the agreement and to determine whether the parties\nintended to arbitrate grievances concerning\u201d a particular matter,id., at 651. They then discharge this duty by: (1)\napplying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly\nformed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about\nwhether it covers the dispute at hand; and (2) adhering to the\npresumption and ordering arbitration only where the presumption is\nnot rebutted. Seeid., at 651\u2013652;Prima Paint\nCorp.,supra, at 396\u2013398;Gateway Coal Co.v.Mine Workers,414 U. S. 368, 374\u2013377 (1974);Drake Bakeries Inc.v.Bakery Workers,370 U. S. 254, 256\u2013257\n(1962);Atkinsonv.Sinclair Refining Co.,370 U. S. 238,\n241\u2013242 (1962);Steelworkersv.Warrior & Gulf\nNav. Co.,363 U. S. 574, 576 (1960).[Footnote 8]Local is thus wrong to suggest that the\npresumption of arbitrability we sometimes apply takes courts\noutside our settled framework for deciding arbitrability. The\npresumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes\nwithin that framework. Confining the presumption to this role\nreflects its foundation in \u201cthe federal policy favoring\narbitration.\u201d As we have explained, this \u201cpolicy\u201d is merely an\nacknowledgment of the FAA\u2019s commitment to \u201coverrule the judiciary\u2019s\nlongstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to\nplace such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\u201dVolt, 489 U. S., at 478 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Accordingly, we have never held that this\npolicy overrides the principle that a court may submit to\narbitration \u201conly those disputes \u2026 that the parties have agreed to\nsubmit.\u201dFirst Options, 514 U. S., at 943; see alsoMastrobuonov.Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,514 U. S. 52, 57 (1995) (\u201c[T]he FAA\u2019s\nproarbitration policy does not operate without regard to the wishes\nof the contract parties\u201d);AT&T Technologies, 475 U.\nS., at 650\u2013651 (applying the same rule to the \u201cpresumption of\narbitrability for labor disputes\u201d). Nor have we held that courts\nmay use policy considerations as a substitute for party agreement.\nSee,e.g.,id., at 648\u2013651;Volt,supra, at 478. We have applied the presumption favoring\narbitration, in FAA and in labor cases, only where it reflects, and\nderives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion that arbitration\nof a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their\nexpress agreement to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a\nprovision clearly and validly committing such issues to an\narbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to encompass\nthe dispute. SeeFirst Options,supra, at 944\u2013945\n(citingMitsubishi, 473 U. S., at 626);Howsam,\n537 U. S., at 83\u201384;AT&T Technologies,supra, at 650 (citingWarrior & Gulf,supra, at 582\u2013583);Drake Bakeries,supra, at 259\u2013260. This simple framework compels reversal\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment because it requires judicial\nresolution of two questions central to Local\u2019s arbitration demand:\nwhen the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers\nthe matters Local wishes to arbitrate.BWe begin by addressing the\ngrounds on which the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s\ndecision to decide the parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute, which\nthe parties characterize as a formation dispute because a union\nvote ratifying the CBA\u2019s terms was necessary to form the contract.\nSee App. 351.[Footnote 9] For\npurposes of determining arbitrability,whena contract is\nformed can be as critical aswhetherit was formed. That\nis the case where, as here, the date on which an agreement was\nratified determines the date the agreement was formed, and thus\ndetermines whether the agreement\u2019s provisions were enforceable\nduring the period relevant to the parties\u2019 dispute.[Footnote 10]This formation date question\nrequires judicial resolution here because it relates to Local\u2019s\narbitration demand in such a way that the District Court was\nrequired to decide the CBA\u2019s ratification date in order to\ndetermine whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters\ncovered by the demand.[Footnote\n11] The parties agree that the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause\npertains only to disputes that \u201carise under\u201d the agreement.\nAccordingly, to hold the parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute\narbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide whether that dispute\ncould be characterized as \u201carising under\u201d the CBA. In answering\nthis question in the affirmative, both Local and the Court of\nAppeals tied the arbitrability of the ratification-date issue\u2014which\nLocal raised as a defense to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims\u2014to the\narbitrability of the strike claims themselves. Seeid., at\n347. They did so because the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause, which\npertains only to disputes \u201carising under\u201d the CBA and thus\npresupposes the CBA\u2019s existence, would seem plainly to cover a\ndispute that \u201carises under\u201d a specific substantive provision of the\nCBA, but does not so obviously cover disputes about the CBA\u2019s own\nformation. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals relied upon the\nratification dispute\u2019s relationship to Granite Rock\u2019s claim that\nLocal breached the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause (a claim the Court of\nAppeals viewed as clearly \u201carising under\u201d the CBA) to conclude that\n\u201cthe arbitration clause is certainly \u2018susceptible of an\ninterpretation\u2019 that covers\u201d Local\u2019s formation-date defense. 546\nF.\u00a03d, at 1177, n.\u00a04.The Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that\nthis theory of the ratification dispute\u2019s arbitrability fails if\nthe CBA was not formed at the time the unions engaged in the acts\nthat gave rise to Granite Rock\u2019s strike claims. The unions began\ntheir strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite Rock filed its suit on\nJuly 9. If, as Local asserts, the CBA containing the parties\u2019\narbitration clause was not ratified, and thus not formed, until\nAugust 22, there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to\n\u201carise under,\u201d and thus no valid basis for the Court of Appeals\u2019\nconclusion that Granite Rock\u2019s July 9 claims arose under the CBA\nand were thus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local\u2019s\nformation date defense to those claims.[Footnote 12] Seeibid. For the foregoing\nreasons, resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute about whether the CBA\nwas ratified in July or August was central to deciding Local\u2019s\narbitration demand. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in\nholding that it was not necessary for the District Court to\ndetermine the CBA\u2019s ratification date in order to decide whether\nthe parties agreed to arbitrate Granite Rock\u2019s no-strike claim or\nthe ratification-date dispute Local raised as a defense to that\nclaim.Local seeks to address this flaw in the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 decision by arguing that in December 2004 the parties\nexecuted a document that rendered the CBA effective as of May 1,\n2004 (the date the prior CBA expired), and that this effective-date\nlanguage rendered the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause (but not its\nno-strike clause) applicable to the July strike period\nnotwithstanding Local\u2019s view that the agreement was ratified in\nAugust (which ratification date Local continues to argue controls\nthe period during which the no-strike clause applies). See Brief\nfor Respondent Local, pp.\u00a026\u201327; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37\u201339.\nThe Court of Appeals did not rule on the merits of this claim\n(i.e., it did not decide whether the CBA\u2019s effective date\nlanguage indeed renders some or all of the agreement\u2019s provisions\nretroactively applicable to May 2004), and we need not do so\neither. Even accepting Local\u2019s assertion that it raised this\nretroactivity argument in the District Court, see Brief for\nRespondent Local, p.\u00a026,[Footnote 13] Local did not raise this argument in the\nCourt of Appeals. Nor, more importantly, did Local\u2019s brief in\nopposition to Granite Rock\u2019s petition for certiorari raise the\nargument as an alternative ground on which this Court could or\nshould affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment finding the\nratification-date dispute arbitrable for the reasons discussed\nabove. Accordingly, the argument is properly \u201cdeemed waived.\u201d This\nCourt\u2019s Rule 15.2;Carcieriv.Salazar, 555 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15\u201316).[Footnote 14]CAlthough the foregoing is\nsufficient to reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, there is an\nadditional reason to do so: The dispute here, whether labeled a\nformation dispute or not, falls outside the scope of the parties\u2019\narbitration clause on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration\ncannot cure. Section 20 of the CBA provides in relevant part that\n\u201c[a]ll disputesarising under this agreementshall be\nresolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,\u201d which\nincludes arbitration. App. 434 (emphasis added); see alsoid., at 434\u2013437. The parties\u2019 ratification-date dispute\ncannot properly be characterized as falling within the (relatively\nnarrow, cf.,e.g.,Drake Bakeries Inc., 370 U.\nS., at 256\u2013257) scope of this provision for at least two reasons.\nFirst, we do not think the question whether the CBA was validly\nratified on July 2, 2004\u2014a question that concerns the CBA\u2019s very\nexistence\u2014can fairly be said to \u201carise under\u201d the CBA. Second, even\nif the \u201carising under\u201d language could in isolation be construed to\ncover this dispute, Section 20\u2019s remaining provisions all but\nforeclose such a reading by describing that section\u2019s arbitration\nrequirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed\nin the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory\nmediation. See App. 434\u2013437 (requiring arbitration of disputes\n\u201carising under\u201d the CBA, but only after the Union and Employer have\nexhausted mandatory mediation, and limiting any arbitration\ndecision under this provision to those \u201cwithin the scope and terms\nof this agreement and \u2026 specifically limited to the matter\nsubmitted\u201d).The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary\nconclusion does not find support in the text of \u00a720. The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 only effort to grapple with that text misses the point\nbecause it focuses on whether Granite Rock\u2019s claim to enforce the\nCBA\u2019sno-strikeprovisions could be characterized as\n\u201carising under\u201d the agreement. See 546 F.\u00a03d, at 1177,\nn.\u00a04. Even assumingthatclaim can be characterized\nas \u201carising under\u201d the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is\nwhether the formation-date defense that Local raised in response to\nGranite Rock\u2019s no-strike suit can be characterized as \u201carising\nunder\u201d the CBA. It cannot for the reasons we have explained,\nnamely, the CBA provision requiring arbitration of disputes\n\u201carising under\u201d the CBA is not fairly read to include a dispute\nabout when the CBA came into existence. The Court of Appeals erred\nin failing to address this question and holding instead that the\narbitration clause is \u201csusceptible of an interpretation\u201d that\ncovers Local\u2019s formation-date defense to Granite Rock\u2019s suit\n\u201c[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing \u2018under\u2019 the alleged new CBA\u201d and\n\u201c[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very broadly.\u201dIbid.;see alsoid., at 1178.DLocal\u2019s remaining argument in\nsupport of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is similarly unavailing.\nLocal reiterates the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Granite Rock\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the\nCBA\u2019s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisions. See Brief for\nRespondent Local, pp.\u00a017\u201318. We do not agree that by seeking\nan injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the\nlabor grievance that gave rise to it, Granite Rock also consented\nto arbitrate the ratification (formation) date dispute we address\nabove. See 564 F.\u00a03d, at 1178. It is of course true that when\nGranite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA (and all of\nits provisions) as enforceable. But Granite Rock\u2019s decision to sue\nfor compliance with the CBA\u2019s grievance procedures on\nstrike-related matters does not establish an agreement, \u201cimplicit\u201d\nor otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBA\u2019s formation date) that\nGranite Rock did not raise, and that Granite Rock has always (and\nrightly, see Part II\u2013C,supra) characterized as beyond the\nscope of the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause. The mere fact that Local\nraised the formation date dispute as a defense to Granite Rock\u2019s\nsuit does not make that dispute attributable to Granite Rock in the\nwaiver or estoppel sense the Court of Appeals suggested, see 546\nF.\u00a03d, at 1178, much less establish that Granite Rock agreed\nto arbitrate it by suing to enforce the CBA as to other matters.\nAccordingly, we hold that the parties\u2019 dispute over the CBA\u2019s\nformation date was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to\nresolve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that\nconclusion.IIIWe turn now to the claims\navailable on remand. The parties agree that Granite Rock can bring\na breach-of-contract claim under LMRA \u00a7301(a) against Local as a\nCBA signatory, and against IBT as Local\u2019s agent or alter ego. See\nBrief for Respondent IBT 10\u201313; Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\u201313\nand n.\u00a011.[Footnote 15]\nThe question is whether Granite Rock may also bring a federal tort\nclaim under \u00a7301(a) for IBT\u2019s alleged interference with the\nCBA.[Footnote 16] Brief for\nPetitioner 32. The Court of Appeals joined virtually all other\nCircuits in holding that it would not recognize such a claim under\n\u00a7301(a).Granite Rock asks us to reject\nthis position as inconsistent with federal labor law\u2019s goal of\npromoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial\nenforcement of CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a\nfederal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this\ngoal. Seeid., at 31; see also,e.g.,Textile\nWorkersv.Lincoln Mills of Ala.,353 U. S. 448, 451 (1957). Explaining\nthat IBT\u2019s conduct in this case undermines the very core of the\nbargaining relationship federal labor laws exist to protect,\nGranite Rock argues that a federal common-law tort remedy for IBT\u2019s\nconduct is necessary because other potential avenues for deterring\nand redressing such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333; Reply Brief for Petitioner 19\u201320.\nOn the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock lists state-law\ntort claims, some of which this Court has held \u00a7301(a) pre-empts,\nas well as administrative (unfair labor practices) claims, which\nGranite Rock says the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot\nentertain against international unions that (like IBT) are not part\nof the certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control. On\nthe insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists federal\ncommon-law breach-of-contract claims, which Granite Rock says are\ndifficult to prove against non-CBA signatories like IBT because\ninternational unions structure their relationships with local\nunions in a way that makes agency or alter ego difficult to\nestablish. Based on these assessments, Granite Rock suggests that\nthis case presents us with the choice of either recognizing the\nfederal common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanctioning\nconduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes and our own\nprecedents. See Brief for Petitioner 13\u201314.We do not believe the choice is as stark as\nGranite Rock implies. It is of course true that we have construed\n\u201cSection 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of\nfederal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining\nagreements.\u201dLewisv.Benedict Coal Corp.,361 U. S. 459,\n470 (1960) (citingLincoln Mills,supra). But we\nhave also emphasized that in developing this common law we \u201cdid not\nenvision any freewheeling inquiry into what the federal courts\nmight find to be the most desirable rule.\u201dHoward Johnson\nCo. v.Hotel Employees,417 U. S. 249, 255\n(1974). The balance federal statutes strike between employer and\nunion relations in the collective-bargaining arena is carefully\ncalibrated, see,e.g.,NLRBv.Drivers,362 U. S. 274,\n289\u2013290 (1960), and as the parties\u2019 briefs illustrate, creating a\nfederal common-law tort cause of action would require a host of\npolicy choices that could easily upset this balance, see Brief for\nRespondent IBT 42\u201344; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22\u201325. It is thus\nno surprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held that\nfederal courts\u2019 authority to \u201ccreate a federal common lawof\ncollective bargaining agreementsunder section 301\u201d should be\nconfined to \u201ca common law of contracts, not a source of independent\nrights, let alone tort rights; for section 301 is \u2026 a grant of\njurisdiction only to enforce contracts.\u201dBrazinskiv.Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6 F.\u00a03d 1176, 1180\n(CA7 1993). We see no reason for a different result here because it\nwould be premature to recognize the federal common law tort Granite\nRock requests in this case even assuming that \u00a7301(a) authorizes us\nto do so.In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that\nthe question before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the\nconduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but whether we\nshould augment the claims already available to Granite Rock by\ncreating a new federal common-law cause of action under \u00a7301(a).\nThat we decline to do so does not mean that we approve of IBT\u2019s\nalleged actions. Granite Rock describes a course of conduct that\ndoes indeed seem to strike at the heart of the\ncollective-bargaining process federal labor laws were designed to\nprotect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however, a new\nfederal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for this\nconduct. Granite Rock\u2019s allegations have prompted favorable\njudgments not only from a federal jury, but also from the NLRB. In\nproceedings that predated those in which the District Court entered\njudgment for Granite Rock on the CBA\u2019s formation date,[Footnote 17] the NLRB concluded that\na \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d was reached on July 2, and that Local and\nIBT violated federal labor laws by attempting to delay the CBA\u2019s\nratification pending execution of a separate agreement favorable to\nIBT. SeeIn\u00a0re Teamsters Local 287,347\nN.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 339, 340\u2013341, and n.\u00a01 (2006)\n(applying the remedial order on the 2004 conduct to both Local and\nIBT on the grounds that IBT did not disaffiliate from the AFL\u2013CIO\nuntil July 25, 2005).These proceedings, and the proceedings that\nremain to be conducted on remand, buttress our conclusion that\nGranite Rock\u2019s case for a new federal common-law cause of action is\nbased on assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief\nthat are at least questionable because they have not been fully\ntested in this case and thus their efficacy is simply not before us\nto evaluate. Notably, Granite Rock (like IBT and the Court of\nAppeals) assumes that federal common law provides the only possible\nbasis for the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue. See Brief for\nRespondent IBT 33\u201334; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But Granite\nRock did not litigate below, and thus does not present us with\noccasion to address, whether state law might provide a remedy. See,e.g.,Steelworkersv.Rawson,495 U. S. 362, 369\u2013371\n(1990);Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO\nCorp.v.Automobile Workers,523 U. S. 653, 656, 658\n(1998). Nor did Granite Rock fully explore the breach-of-contract\nand administrative causes of action it suggests are insufficient to\nremedy IBT\u2019s conduct. For example, far from establishing that an\nagency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccessful, the\nrecord in this case suggests it might be easier to prove than usual\nif, as the NLRB\u2019s decision observes, IBT and Local were affiliated\nin 2004 in a way relevant to Granite Rock\u2019s claims. SeeIn re\nTeamsters Local 287, supra,at 340, n.\u00a06. Similarly,\nneither party has established that the Board itself could not issue\nadditional relief against IBT. IBT\u2019samiciargue that the\n\u201coverlap between Granite Rock\u2019s \u00a7301 claim against the IBT and the\nNLRB General Counsel\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint against\nLocal 287 brings into play the National Labor Relations Act rule\nthat an international union commits an unfair labor practice by\ncausing its affiliated local unions to \u2018impose extraneous\nnon-bargaining unit considerations into the collective bargaining\nprocess.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for American Federation of Labor et\u00a0al.\n30\u201331 (quotingPaperworkers Local 620, 309\nN.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 44, 44 (1992)). The fact that at least\none Court of Appeals has recognized the viability of such a claim,\nseeKobellv.United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union,\n965 F.\u00a02d 1401, 1407\u20131409 (CA6 1992), further persuades us\nthat Granite Rock\u2019s arguments do not justify recognition of a new\nfederal tort claim under \u00a7301(a).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment on the arbitrability of the parties\u2019 formation-date\ndispute, affirm its judgment dismissing Granite Rock\u2019s claims\nagainst IBT to the extent those claims depend on the creation of a\nnew federal common-law tort cause of action under \u00a7301(a), and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1In deciding the arbitration question in this\ncase we rely upon the terms of the CBA and the facts in the\nDistrict Court record. In reviewing the judgment affirming\ndismissal of Granite Rock\u2019s tort claims against respondent\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) for failure to state a\nclaim, we rely on the facts alleged in Granite Rock\u2019s Third Amended\nComplaint. See,e.g.,H. J. Inc.v.Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,492 U. S. 229, 250\n(1989).Footnote 2This Court has recognized a federal\ncommon-law claim for breach of a CBA under LMRA \u00a7301(a). See,e.g.,Textile Workersv.Lincoln Mills of\nAla.,353 U. S. 448, 456 (1957).Footnote 3The CBA\u2019s ratification date is important to\nGranite Rock\u2019s underlying suit for strike damages. If the District\nCourt correctly concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2,\nGranite Rock could argue on remand that the July work stoppage\nviolated the CBA\u2019s no-strike clause.Footnote 4Although a union ratification vote is not\nalways required for the provisions in a CBA to be considered\nvalidly formed, the parties agree that ratification was such a\npredicate here. See App. 349\u2013351.Footnote 5Because neither party argues that the\narbitrator should decide this question, there is no need to apply\nthe rule requiring \u201c\u00a0\u2018clear and unmistakable\u2019\u00a0\u201d evidence\nof an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability.First Options of\nChicago, Inc.v.Kaplan,514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995) (quotingAT&T Technologies, Inc.v.Communications\nWorkers,475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986) (alterations\nomitted)).Footnote 6We, like the Court of Appeals, discuss\nprecedents applying the FAA because they employ the same rules of\narbitrability that govern labor cases. See,e.g.,AT&T Technologies,supra, at 650. Indeed, the\nrule that arbitration is strictly a matter of consent\u2014and thus that\ncourts must typically decide any questions concerning the formation\nor scope of an arbitration agreement before ordering parties to\ncomply with it\u2014is the cornerstone of the framework the Court\nannounced in theSteelworkers Trilogyfor deciding\narbitrability disputes in LMRA cases. SeeSteelworkersv.American Mfg. Co.,363 U. S. 564, 567\u2013568\n(1960);Steelworkersv.Warrior & Gulf Nav.\nCo.,363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960);Steelworkersv.Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp.,363 U. S. 593,\n597 (1960).Footnote 7See alsoMastrobuonov.Shearson\nLehman Hutton, Inc.,514 U. S. 52, 57 (1995);Dean\nWitter Reynolds Inc.v.Byrd,470 U. S. 213, 219\u2013220\n(1985);Scherkv.Alberto-Culver Co.,417 U. S. 506, 511\n(1974);AT&T Technologies,supra, at 648;Warrior & Gulf,supra, at 582;United\nStatesv.Moorman,338 U. S. 457, 462\n(1950).Footnote 8That our labor arbitration precedents apply\nthis rule is hardly surprising. As noted above, see n.\u00a06,supra,the rule is the foundation for the arbitrability\nframework this Court announced in theSteelworkers\nTrilogy. Local\u2019s assertion thatWarrior & Gulfsuggests otherwise is misplaced. AlthoughWarrior &\nGulfcontains language that might in isolation be misconstrued\nas establishing a presumption that labor disputes are arbitrable\nwhenever they are not expressly excluded from an arbitration\nclause, 363 U. S., at 578\u2013582, the opinion elsewhere emphasizes\nthat even in LMRA cases, \u201ccourts\u201d must construe arbitration clauses\nbecause \u201ca party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any\ndispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201dId., at 582\n(applying this rule and finding the dispute at issue arbitrable\nonly after determining that the parties\u2019 arbitration clause could\nbe construed under standard principles of contract interpretation\nto cover it).Our use of the same rules in FAA cases is also\nunsurprising. The rules are suggested by the statute itself.\nSection 2 of the FAA requires courts to enforce valid and\nenforceable arbitration agreements according to their terms. And \u00a74\nprovides in pertinent part that where a party invokes the\njurisdiction of a federal court over a matter that the court could\nadjudicate but for the presence of an arbitration clause, \u201c[t]he\ncourt shall hear the parties\u201d and \u201cdirec[t] the parties to proceed\nto arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement\u201d\nexcept \u201c[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the\nfailure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue,\u201d in\nwhich case \u201cthe court shall proceed summarily to the trial\nthereof.\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.Footnote 9The parties\u2019 dispute about the CBA\u2019s\nratification date presents a formation question in the sense above,\nand is therefore not on all fours with, for example, the formation\ndisputes we referenced inBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc.v.Cardegna,546 U. S. 440, 444, n.1 (2006), which\nconcerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was\n\u201cconcluded.\u201d That said, the manner in which the CBA\u2019s ratification\ndate relates to Local\u2019s arbitration demand makes the\nratification-date dispute in this case one that requires judicial\nresolution. Seeinfra, at 14\u201319.Footnote 10Our conclusions about the significance of the\nCBA\u2019s ratification date to the specific arbitrability question\nbefore us do not disturb the general rule that parties may agree to\narbitrate past disputes or future disputes based on past\nevents.Footnote 11In reaching this conclusion we need not, and\ndo not, decide whether every dispute over a CBA\u2019s ratification date\nwould require judicial resolution. We recognize that ratification\ndisputes in labor cases may often qualify as \u201cformation disputes\u201d\nfor contract law purposes because contract law defines formation as\nacceptance of an offer on specified terms, and in many labor cases\nratification of a CBA is necessary to satisfy this formation\nrequirement. See App. 349\u2013351. But it is not the mere labeling of a\ndispute for contract law purposes that determines whether an issue\nis arbitrable. The test for arbitrability remains whether the\nparties consented to arbitrate the dispute in question.Footnote 12This analysis pertains only to the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision, which did not engage the 11th-hour retroactivity\nargument Local raised in its merits brief in this Court, and that\nwe address below.Footnote 13This claim is questionable because Local\u2019s\nFebruary 2005 references to the agreement \u201cnow in effect\u201d are not\nobviously equivalent to the express retroactivity argument Local\nasserts in its merits brief in this Court. See Brief for Respondent\nLocal, pp. 26\u2013>27.Footnote 14Justice Sotomayor\u2019s conclusion that we should\nnonetheless excuse Local\u2019s waiver and consider the retroactivity\nargument, seepost, at 5\u20136 (opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part), is flawed. This Court\u2019s Rule 15.2 reflects the\nfact that our adversarial system assigns both sides responsibility\nfor framing the issues in a case. The importance of enforcing the\nRule is evident in cases where, as here, excusing a party\u2019s\nnoncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in the\nfirst instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and\nother cases in a manner that the District Court and Court of\nAppeals did not have an opportunity to consider, and that the\nparties\u2019 arguments before this Court may not fully address.Footnote 15Although the parties concede the general\navailability of such a claim against IBT, they dispute whether\nGranite Rock abandoned its agency or alter ego allegations in the\ncourse of this litigation. Compare Brief for Respondent IBT, p. 10\nwith Reply Brief for Petitioner 12\u201313, n. 11. Granite Rock concedes\nthat it has abandoned its claim that IBT acted as Local\u2019s\nundisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification response to\nthe July 2, 2004, CBA. See Plaintiff Granite Rock\u2019s Memorandum of\nPoints and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant IBT\u2019s Motion to\nDismiss in No. 5:04\u2013cv\u201302767\u2013JW (ND Cal., Aug. 7, 2006), Doc. 178,\npp.\u00a06, 8 (hereinafter Points and Authorities). But Granite\nRock insists that it preserved its argument that Local served as\nIBT\u2019s agent or alter ego when Local denied ratification and engaged\nin unauthorized strike activity in July 2004. Nothing in the record\nbefore us unequivocally refutes this assertion. See App. 306,\n311\u2013315, 318; Points and Authorities 6, n.\u00a03. Accordingly,\nnothing in this opinion forecloses the parties from litigating\nthese claims on remand.Footnote 16IBT argues that we should dismiss this\nquestion as improvidently granted because Granite Rock abandoned\nits tortious interference claim when it declared its intention to\nseek only contractual (as opposed to punitive) damages on the\nclaim. See Brief for Respondent IBT 16. We reject this argument,\nwhich confuses Granite Rock\u2019s decision to forgo the pursuit of\npunitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon the claim\nitself. The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no authority for\nthe proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than economic\ndamages to state a claim on which relief could be granted.Footnote 17Although the Board and federal jury reached\ndifferent conclusions with respect to the CBA\u2019s ratification date,\nthe discrepancy has little practical significance because the\nBoard\u2019s remedial order against Local and IBT gives \u201cretroactive\neffect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2, 2004, as if ratified on\nthat date.\u201dIn re Teamsters Local 287,347\nN.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 339, 340 (2006).",
