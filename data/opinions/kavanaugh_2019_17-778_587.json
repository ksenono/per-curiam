The question is whether\nremaining-in burglary (i) occurs only if a person has the intent to\ncommit a crimeat the exactmomentwhen he or shefirstunlawfully remains in a building or structure, or (ii)\nmore broadly, occurs when a person forms the intent to commit a\ncrimeat any timewhile unlawfully remaining in a building\nor structure. For purposes of \u00a7924(e), we conclude that\nremaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to\ncommit a crimeat any timewhile unlawfully remaining in a\nbuilding or structure. We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.IOn August 24, 2013, police officers in Grand\nRapids, Michigan, responded to a 911 call. When the officers\narrived at the scene, the caller, Chasity Warren, told the officers\nthat she had just escaped from her boyfriend, Jamar Quarles. Warren\nsaid that Quarles had threatened her at gunpoint and also hit her.\nWhile the police officers were speaking with Warren, Quarles drove\nby. The officers then arrested Quarles and later searched his\nhouse. Inside they found a semiautomatic pistol.Quarles pled guilty to being a felon in\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(g)(1). Quarles had at least three prior convictions that\nappeared to qualify as violent felonies under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e). Those three\nconvictions were: (1) a 2002 Michigan conviction for third-degree\nhome invasion stemming from an attempt to chase down an\nex-girlfriend who had sought refuge in a nearby apartment; (2) a\n2004 Michigan conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon based\non an incident where Quarles held a gun to the head of another\nex-girlfriend and threatened to kill her; and (3) a 2008 Michigan\nconviction for assault with a dangerous weapon arising from an\naltercation with another man and that same ex-girlfriend in which\nQuarles shot at the man.In the sentencing proceedings for his federal\nfelon-in-possession offense, Quarles argued that his 2002 Michigan\nconviction for third-degree home invasion did not qualify as a\nburglary under \u00a7924(e). Under this Court\u2019s precedents, the District\nCourt had to decide whether the Michigan statute under which\nQuarles was convicted in 2002 was broader than the generic\ndefinition of burglary set forth inTaylor(in which case\nthe conviction would not qualify as a prior conviction under\n\u00a7924(e)) or, instead, whether the Michigan statute \u201csubstantially\ncorrespond[ed]\u201d to or was narrower than the generic definition of\nburglary set forth inTaylor.495 U.\u00a0S., at 602. To\nreiterate,Taylorinterpreted burglary under \u00a7924(e) to mean\n\u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in, a\nbuilding or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201dId.,\nat 599 (emphasis added).Under the Michigan law at issue here, a person\ncommits third-degree home invasion if he or she \u201cbreaks and enters\na dwelling or enters a dwelling without permission and,at any\ntimewhile he or she is entering,present in, or exiting\nthe dwelling, commits a misdemeanor.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7750.110a(4)(a) (West 2004) (emphasis added). Quarles argued to the\nDistrict Court that the Michigan third-degree home invasion statute\nswept too broadly to qualify as burglary under \u00a7924(e) because the\nMichigan statute encompassed situations where the defendant forms\nthe intent to commit a crimeatany timewhile\nunlawfully remaining in a dwelling, notat the exact momentwhen the defendant isfirstunlawfully present in a\ndwelling. The District Court rejected that argument and sentenced\nQuarles to 17 years in prison. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 850 F.3d\n836, 840 (2017). We granted certio- rari in light of a Circuit\nsplit on the question of how to assess state remaining-in burglary\nstatutes for purposes of \u00a7924(e). 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).IISection 924(e) lists \u201cburglary\u201d as a\nqualifying predicate offense for purposes of the Armed Career\nCriminal Act. But \u00a7924(e) does not define \u201cburglary.\u201d The question\nhere is how to define \u201cburglary\u201d under \u00a7924(e). We do not write on\na clean slate. SeeTaylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 599.At common law, burglary was confined to unlawful\nbreaking and entering a dwelling at night with the intent to commit\na felony. See,e.g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 224 (1769). But by the time Congress passed and\nPresident Reagan signed the current version of \u00a7924(e) in 1986,\nstate burglary statutes had long since departed from the common-law\nformulation. SeeTaylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 593\u2013596. In\naddition to casting off relics like the requirement that there be a\nbreaking, or that the unlawful entry occur at night, a majority of\nStates by 1986 prohibited unlawfully \u201cremaining in\u201d a building or\nstructure with intent to commit a crime. Those remaining-in\nstatutes closed a loophole in some States\u2019 laws by extending\nburglary to cover situations where a per- son enters a structure\nlawfully but stays unlawfully\u2014for example, by remaining in a store\nafter closing time without permission to do so.In the 1990Taylordecision, this Court\ninterpreted the term \u201cburglary\u201d in \u00a7924(e) in accord with the more\nexpansive understanding of burglary that had become common by 1986:\n\u201cWe believe that Congress meant by \u2018burglary\u2019 the generic sense in\nwhich the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\u201d\n495 U.\u00a0S., at 598. The Court concluded that generic burglary\nunder \u00a7924(e) means \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into,or\nremaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a\ncrime.\u201dId., at 599 (emphasis added). A defendant\u2019s prior\nconviction under a state statute qualifies as a predicate burglary\nunder \u00a7924(e) if the state statute\u2014regardless of its \u201cexact\ndefinition or label\u201d\u2014\u201csubstantially corresponds\u201d to or is narrower\nthan the generic definition of burglary.Id.,at 599,\n602.In this case, we must determine the scope of\ngeneric remaining-in burglary underTaylor\u2014in particular,\nthe timing of the intent requirement. Quarles argues that\nremaining-in burglary occurs only when the defendant has the intent\nto commit a crimeat the exact momentwhen he or shefirstunlawfully remains in a building or structure. The\nGovernment argues for a broader definition of remaining-in\nburglary. According to the Government, remaining-in burglary occurs\nwhen the defendant forms the intent to commit a crimeat any\ntimewhile unlawfully present in a building or structure. We\nagree with the Government.As noted,Taylorinterpreted generic\nburglary under \u00a7924(e) to include remaining-in burglary.Id., at 599. In ordinary usage, \u201cremaining in\u201d refers to a\ncontinuous activity. SeeUnited Statesv.Cores,356 U.S.\n405, 408 (1958); see also Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 2106 (2d ed. 1949); 8 Oxford English Dictionary 418\n(1933). This Court has followed that ordinary meaning in analogous\nlegal contexts. For example, when interpreting a federal criminal\nstatute punishing any \u201c\u00a0\u2018alien crewman who willfully remains\nin the United States in excess of the number of days\nallowed,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the Court stated that \u201cthe crucial word \u2018remains\u2019\npermits no connotation other than continuing presence.\u201dCores, 356 U.\u00a0S., at 408. The law of trespass likewise\nproscribes remaining on the land of another without permission. In\nthat context, the term \u201cremain\u201d refers to \u201ca continuing trespass\nfor the entire time during which the actor wrongfully remains.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7158, Comment m, p. 280 (1965).Those interpretations of \u201cremaining in\u201d in\nanalogous areas of the law inform our interpretation of\n\u201cremaining-in\u201d burglary in \u00a7924(e). In particular, the common\nunderstanding of \u201cremaining in\u201d as a continuous event means that\nburglary occurs for purposes of \u00a7924(e) if the defendant forms the\nintent to commit a crimeat any timeduring the continuous\nevent of unlawfully remaining in a building or structure. To put it\nin conventional criminal law terms: Because theactus reusis a continuous event, themens reamatches theactus\nreusso long as the burglar forms the intent to commit a crime\nat any time while unlawfully present in the building or\nstructure.Quarles insists, however, that to constitute a\nburglary under \u00a7924(e), the intent to commit a crime must be\ncontemporaneous with unlawful entry or remaining. That is true. But\nthe defendant\u2019s intentiscontemporaneous with the unlawful\nremaining so long as the defendant forms the intent at any time\nwhile unlawfully remaining. Put sim- ply, for burglary predicated\non unlawfulentry, the defendant must have the intent to\ncommit a crime at the time of entry. For burglary predicated on\nunlawfulremaining, the defendant must have the intent to\ncommit a crime at the time of remaining, which is any time during\nwhich the defendant unlawfully remains.That conclusion is supported by the States\u2019 laws\nas of 1986 when Congress enacted \u00a7924(e). As of 1986, a majority of\nStates proscribed remaining-in burglary. At that time, there was\nnot much case law addressing the precise timing of the intent\nrequirement for remaining-in bur- glary. That is presumably because\nin most remaining-in burglaries, the defendant has the intent to\ncommit a crime when he or she first unlawfully remains in a\nbuilding or structure. The timing issue arises only in the rarer\ncases where the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime only\nafter unlawfully remaining in the building or structure for a\nwhile. In any event, for present purposes, the important point is\nthat all of the state appellate courts that had definitively\naddressed this issue as of 1986 had interpreted remaining-in\nburglary to occur when the defendant forms the intent to commit a\ncrime at any time while unlawfully present in the building or\nstructure. SeeGrattonv.State,456 So. 2d 865, 872 (Ala. Crim. App. 1984);Statev.Embree, 130 Ariz. 64, 66, 633 P.2d 1057, 1059 (App. 1981);Keithv.State, 138 Ga. App. 239,225 S.E.2d 719, 720 (1976);Statev.Mogenson, 10\nKan. App. 2d 470, 472\u2013476,701 P.2d 1339, 1343\u20131345 (1985);Statev.Papineau, 53 Ore. App. 33, 38,630 P.2d 904, 906\u2013907 (1981).[1]Especially in light of the body of state law as\nof 1986, it is not likely that Congress intended generic burglary\nunder \u00a7924(e) toinclude(i) a burglar who intends to commit\na crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains\nin a building or structure, but toexclude(ii) a burglar\nwho forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully\nremaining in a building or structure.Indeed, excluding that latter category of\nburglaries from generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) would make little\nsense in light of Congress\u2019 rationale for specifying burglary as a\nviolent felony. As the Court recognized inTaylor, Congress\n\u201csingled out burglary\u201d because of its \u201cinherent potential for harm\nto persons.\u201d 495 U.\u00a0S., at 588. Burglary is dangerous because\nit \u201ccreates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the\noffender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes\nto investigate.\u201dIbid.; see alsoUnited Statesv.Stitt, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 6).With respect to remaining-in burglary, the\npossibility of a violent confrontation does not depend on the exact\nmoment when the burglar forms the intent to commit a crime while\nunlawfully present in a building or structure. Once an intruder is\nboth unlawfully present inside a building or structure and has the\nrequisite intent to commit a crime, all of the reasons that led\nCongress to include burglary as a \u00a7924(e) predicate fully apply.\nThe dangers of remaining-in burglary are not tied to the esoteric\nquestion of precisely when the defendant forms the intent to commit\na crime. That point underscores that Congress, when enacting\n\u00a7924(e) in 1986, would not have understood the meaning of burglary\nto hinge on exactly when the defendant forms the intent to commit a\ncrime while unlawfully present in a building or structure.Moreover, to interpret remaining-in burglary\nnarrowly, as Quarles advocates, would thwart the stated goals of\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act. After all, most burglaries involve\nunlawful entry, not unlawful remaining in. Yet if we were to\nnarrowly interpret the remaining-in category of generic burglary so\nas to require that the defendant have the intent to commit a crime\nat the exact moment he or she first unlawfully remains, then many\nStates\u2019 bur- glary statutes would be broader than generic burglary.\nAs a result, under our precedents, many States\u2019 burglary statutes\nwould presumably be eliminated as predicate offenses under \u00a7924(e).\nThat result not only would defy common sense, but also would defeat\nCongress\u2019 stated objective of imposing enhanced punishment on armed\ncareer criminals who have three prior convictions for burglary or\nother violent felonies. We should not lightly conclude that\nCongress enacted a self-defeating statute. See,e.g.,Stokelingv.United States, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 8);Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 594.To sum up: The Armed Career Criminal Act does\nnot define the term \u201cburglary.\u201d InTaylor, the Court\nexplained that \u201cCongress did not wish to specify an exact\nformulation that an offense must meet in order to count as\n\u2018burglary\u2019 for enhancement purposes.\u201dId., at 599. And the\nCourt recognized that the definitions of burglary \u201cvary\u201d among the\nStates.Id., at 598. TheTaylorCourt therefore\ninterpreted the generic term \u201cburglary\u201d in \u00a7924(e) in light of: the\nordinary understanding of burglary as of 1986; the States\u2019 laws at\nthat time; Congress\u2019 recognition of the dangers of burglary; and\nCongress\u2019 stated objective of imposing increased punishment on\narmed career criminals who had committed prior burglaries. Looking\nat those sources, theTaylorCourt interpreted generic\nburglary under \u00a7924(e) to encompass remaining-in burglary. Looking\nat those same sources, we interpret remaining-in burglary under\n\u00a7924(e) to occur when the defendant forms the intent to commit a\ncrime at any time while unlawfully present in a building or\nstructure.IIIIn light of our conclusion that generic\nremaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to\ncommit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building\nor structure, Quarles\u2019 case is easily resolved. The question in\nQuarles\u2019 case is whether the Michigan home-invasion statute under\nwhich he was convicted in 2002 is broader than generic burglary or,\ninstead, \u201csubstantially corresponds\u201d to or is narrower than generic\nburglary.Id., at 602. Regarding that inquiry, theTaylorCourt cautioned courts against seizing on modest\nstate-law deviations from the generic definition of burglary. A\nstate law\u2019s \u201cexact definition or label\u201d does not control.Id., at 599. As the Court stated inTaylor, so long\nas the state law in question \u201csubstantially corresponds\u201d to (or is\nnarrower than) generic burglary, the conviction qualifies under\n\u00a7924(e).Id.,at 602.As stated above, generic remaining-in burglary\noccurs under \u00a7924(e) when the defendant forms the intent to commit\na crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or\nstructure. For the Court\u2019s purposes here, the Michigan statute\nsubstantially corresponds to or is narrower than generic\nburglary.[2]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1The consensus position\nhas not changed. Today, of the States that have addressed the\nquestion, at least 18 have adopted the \u201cat any time\u201d interpretation\nof remaining-in burglary, and only 3 appear to have adopted the\nnarrower interpretation. Of those 18 States, some have adopted the\nbroader \u201cat any time\u201d interpretation by statute. See Colo. Rev.\nStat. \u00a718\u20134\u2013201(3) (2018); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7829(e) (2015);\nHaw. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7708\u2013812.5 (2014); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7750.110a(4)(a) (West 2004); Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7609.581(4), 609.582(3)\n(2016); Mont. Code Ann. \u00a745\u20136\u2013204(1) (2017); Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u201314\u2013402(a)(3) (2018); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a730.02(a)(3) (West\n2019). And in addition to the five pre-1986 state-court decisions\nidentified in the text above, at least five post-1986 state-court\ndecisions have adopted the \u201cat any time\u201d interpretation of\n\u201cremaining in.\u201d SeeBraddyv.State, 111 So. 3d 810,\n844 (Fla. 2012) (per curiam);Statev.Walker,\n600 N.W.2d 606, 609 (Iowa 1999);Statev.DeNoyer,541 N.W.2d 725, 732 (S. D. 1995);Statev.Rudolph, 970 P.2d 1221, 1228\u20131229 (Utah 1998);Statev.Allen, 127 Wash. App. 125, 135, 110 P.3d 849, 853\u2013855\n(2005). By contrast, three state courts appear to have adopted the\nnarrower interpretation.Shettersv.State,751 P.2d 31, 36, n. 2 (Alaska App. 1988);Peoplev.Gaines, 74 N.Y.2d 358, 361\u2013363, 546 N.E.2d 913, 915\u2013916\n(1989);In re J. N. S., 258 Ore. App. 310, 318\u2013319, 308 P.3d\n1112, 1117\u20131118 (2013).2In his brief, Quarles\nalternatively suggests that Michigan\u2019s home-invasion statute\nactually does not require that the defendant haveanyintent\nto commit a crime atanytime while unlawfully present in a\ndwelling. Brief for Petitioner 9. Quarles offers no support for his\nsuggestion that there is nomens rearequirement. In any\nevent, Quarles did not preserve that argument, and we do not\naddress it.",
