PARDUS\net\u00a0al.on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the tenth circuitNo. 06\u20137317.\u2003Decided June 4, 2007Justice Thomas, dissenting.I have repeatedly stated that the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment\nhistorically concerned only injuries relating to a criminal\nsentence.Farmerv.Brennan,511 U. S. 825, 861\n(1994) (opinion concurring in judgment);Hellingv.McKinney,509 U. S. 25, 42 (1993)\n(dissenting opinion);Hudsonv.McMillian,503 U. S. 1, 18\u201320\n(1992) (dissenting opinion). But even applying the Court\u2019s flawed\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence, \u201cI would draw the line at actual,\nserious injuries and reject the claim that exposure to theriskof injury can violate the Eighth Amendment.\u201dHelling,supra,at 42 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\nConsistent with these views, I would affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals. I respectfully dissent.",
