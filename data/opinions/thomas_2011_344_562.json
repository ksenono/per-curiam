S. ____ (2011)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 09-150MICHIGAN, PETITIONERv.RICHARD PERRY\nBRYANTon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmichigan[February 28, 2011]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment.I agree with the Court\nthat the admission of Covington\u2019s out-of-court statements did not\nviolate the Confrontation Clause, but I reach this conclusion\nbecause Covington\u2019s questioning by police lacked sufficient\nformality and solemnity for his statements to be considered\n\u201ctestimonial.\u201d SeeCrawfordv.Washington,541 U. S. 36, 68\n(2004).In determining whether Covington\u2019s statements\nto police implicate the Confrontation Clause, the Court evaluates\nthe \u201c\u00a0\u2018primary purpose\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the interrogation.Ante, at 12. The majority\u2019s analysiswhich relies on,inter alia, what the police knew when they arrived at the\nscene, the specific questions they asked, the particular\ninformation Covington conveyed, the weapon involved, and\nCovington\u2019s medical conditionillustrates the uncertainty that this\ntest creates for law enforcement and the lower courts.Ante, at 25\u201331. I have criticized the primary-purpose test\nas \u201can exercise in fiction\u201d that is \u201cdisconnected from history\u201d and\n\u201cyields no predictable results.\u201dDavisv.Washington,547 U. S. 813, 839, 838\n(2006) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart).Rather than attempting to reconstruct the\n\u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the participants, I would consider the extent\nto which the interrogation resembles those historical practices\nthat the Confrontation Clause addressed. See,e.g.,id., at 835\u2013836 (describing \u201cpractices that occurred under\nthe English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of\nQueen Mary\u201d). As the majority notes, Covington interacted with the\npolice under highly informal circumstances, while he bled from a\nfatal gunshot wound.Ante, at 19\u201320, 31. The police\nquestioning was not \u201ca formalized dialogue,\u201d did not result in\n\u201cformalized testimonial ma-terials\u201d such as a deposition or\naffidavit, and bore no \u201cin- dicia of solemnity.\u201dDavis,supra, at 840, 837 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see alsoGilesv.California,554 U. S. 353, 377\u2013378\n(2008) (Thomas, J., concurring). Nor is there any indication that\nthe statements were offered at trial \u201cin order to evade\nconfrontation.\u201dDavis,supra, at 840. This\ninterrogation bears little if any resemblance to the historical\npractices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\nCovington thus did not \u201cbea[r] testimony\u201d against Bryant,Crawford,supra, at 51, and the introduction of\nhis statements at trial did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.\nI concur in the judgment.",
