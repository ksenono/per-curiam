Puerto Rico\u2019s compact with the Federal\nGovernment and its republican form of government may not alter its\nstatus as a Territory. But territorial status should not be wielded\nas a talismanic opt out of prior congressional commitments or\nconstitutional constraints.IAPuerto Rico became a Territory of the United\nStates in 1898, pursuant to a treaty concluding the\nSpanish-American War. After a series of temporary military\ngoverning measures, Congress passed the Foraker Act of 1900,\nestablishing a civil government exercising significant authority\nover Puerto Rico\u2019s internal territorial affairs. Organic Act of\n1900, ch. 191, 31Stat. 77. Over time, Congress put in place\nincremental measures of autonomy, such as by granting U.\u00a0S.\ncitizenship to the island\u2019s inhabitants in 1917 and providing for\nthe popular election of certain territorial officials the same\nyear.

Thus,\nalthough the terms of the compact provided for Congress\u2019 approval,\n\u201cwhen such constitution did go into effect pursuant to the\nresolution of approval by the Congress, it became what the Congress\ncalled it, a \u2018constitution\u2019 under which the people of Puerto Rico\norganized a government of their own adoption.\u201dFigueroav.Puerto Rico, 232 F.2d 615, 620 (CA1 1956) (citation\nomitted). \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s power, the [Puerto Rico] Constitution\nproclaims, \u2018emanates from the people and shall be exercised in\naccordance with their will, within the terms of the compact agreed\nupon between the people of Puerto Rico and the United\nStates.\u2019\u00a0\u201dS\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 4).With the passage of Public Law 600 and the\nadoption and recognition of the Puerto Rico Constitution, \u201cthe\nUnited States and Puerto Rico .\u00a0.\u00a0. forged a unique\npolitical relationship, built on the island\u2019s evolution into a\nconstitutional democracy exercising local self-rule.\u201dId.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2); cf.Calero-Toledo, 416 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 672 (noting with approval the view that, after Public Law 600,\nPuerto Rico became \u201ca political entity created by the act and with\nthe consent of the people of Puerto Rico and joined in union with\nthe United States of America under the terms of the compact\u201d\n(quotingMorav.Mejias, 206 F.2d 377, 387 (CA1\n1953))).Of critical import here, the Federal Government\n\u201crelinquished its control over [Puerto Rico\u2019s] local affairs[,]\ngrant[ing] Puerto Rico a measure of autonomy comparable to that\npossessed by the States.\u201dExamining Bd. of Engineers,Architects and Surveyorsv.Flores de Otero,426 U.S.\n572, 597 (1976).

Seeinfra, at 11\u201312.BIn the decades that followed, Puerto Rico\nunderwent further changes as a Commonwealth. For many years, the\nisland experienced dynamic growth, increasing its gross national\nproduct more than fourfold from 1950 to 1971. Cheatham, Council on\nForeign Relations, Puerto Rico: A U.\u00a0S. Territory in Crisis\n(Feb. 13, 2020). In 1976, after the revised Federal Tax Code\nconferred preferential tax treatment on productive industries in\nPuerto Rico, Puerto Rico developed robust pharmaceutical and\nmanufacturing sectors. Issacharoff, Bursak, Rennie, & Webley,\nWhat Is Puerto Rico? 94 Ind. L.\u00a0J. 1, 27 (2019).Eventually, however, the island and its people\nconfronted several economic setbacks. Congress repealed Puerto\nRico\u2019s favorable tax credits, and manufacturing growth deflated,\nprecipitating a prolonged recession. Steady outmigration correlated\nwith persistently high unemployment rates greater than 8 percent.\nDept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Databases, Tables &\nCalculators by Subject (May 28, 2020). Deprived of its primary\nsources of income, the Commonwealth began borrowing heavily. The\nisland\u2019s outstanding debts rose to approximately $70 billion, a sum\ngreater than its annual economic output. Puerto Rico\u2019s credit\nratings were downgraded to junk levels, D. Austin, Congressional\nResearch Service, Puerto Rico\u2019s Current Fiscal Challenges 4, 13\n(June 3, 2016), rendering borrowing practically impossible. Without\nany realistic ability to set its finances on the right course, the\nisland declared bankruptcy in 2016.Months later, Hurricane Maria made landfall,\ncausing immense devastation and a humanitarian emergency the likes\nof which had not been seen in over a century. The island suffered\nthousands of casualties and an estimated $90 billion in damages.\nMost recently, significant earthquakes have further rattled an\nalready shaken population and economy still recovering from the\nimpact of Hurricane Maria.

Other proposed cuts\ntake aim at already depleted healthcare and educational services.\nIt is under the yoke of such austerity measures that the island\u2019s\n3.2 million citizens now chafe.PROMESA does not provide for the appointment of\nBoard members according to the straightforward methods set out in\nthe Appointments Clause. U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72,\ncl.\u00a02 (requiring principal \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to\nbe nominated by the President, with Senate advice and consent).\nInstead, the statute prescribes a labyrinthine procedure by which\nthe Speaker of the House, majority leader of the Senate, minority\nleader of the House, and minority leader of the Senate each submit\nto the President separate lists with any number of candidates; and\nthe President, in turn, selects individuals from each of those\nlists, plus an individual in his sole discretion. See \u00a7101(e),\n130Stat. 554\u2013555.[2] With only\none exception, then, the President is not \u201csingly and absolutely\u201d\nresponsible for any members of the Board. The Federalist No. 77, p.\n461 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (Appointments Clause\nensures that \u201c[t]he blame of a bad nomination .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfall[s] upon the President singly and absolutely\u201d). And with no\nexceptions, the Senate fails to advise or consent to the\nPresident\u2019s selections.Despite the Board\u2019s wide-ranging, veto-free\nauthority over Puerto Rico, the solitary role PROMESA contemplates\nfor Puerto Rican-selected officials is this: The Governor of Puerto\nRico sits as an ex officio Board member without any voting rights.\n\u00a7101(e)(3), 130Stat. 555. No individual within Puerto Rico\u2019s\ngovernment plays any part in determining which seven members now\ndecide matters critical to the island\u2019s financial fate.IIAIn concluding that the Board members are\nterritorial officers not subject to the strictures of the\nAppointment Clause, the Court does not meaningfully address Puerto\nRico\u2019s history or status. Nor need it, as the parties do not\ndiscuss the potential consequences that Congress\u2019 recognition of\ncomplete self-government decades ago may have on the Appointments\nClause analysis. But in my view, however one distinguishes\nterritorial officers from federal officers (whether under the\nCourt\u2019s \u201cprimarily local\u201d test,ante, at 14, or some other\nstandard), the longstanding compact between the Federal Government\nand Puerto Rico raises grave doubts as to whether the Board members\nare territorial officers not subject to the Appointments Clause.\nWhen Puerto Rico and Congress entered into a compact and ratified a\nconstitution of Puerto Rico\u2019s adoption, Congress explicitly left\nthe authority to choose Puerto Rico\u2019s governmental officers to the\npeople of Puerto Rico. That turn of events seems to give to Puerto\nRico, through a voluntary concession by the Federal Government, the\nexclusive right to establish Puerto Rico\u2019s own territorial\nofficers.No less than the bedrock principles of\ngovernment upon which this Nation was founded ground this\nproposition. When the Framers resolved to build this Nation on a\nrepublican form of government, they understood that the American\npeople would have the authority to select their own governmental\nofficers. See,e.g., The Federalist No. 39, at 251 (J.\nMadison) (\u201c[W]e may define a republic to be .\u00a0.\u00a0. a\ngovernment which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from\nthe great body of the people\u201d); A. Amar, America\u2019s Constitution: A\nBiography 278\u2013279 (2005) (\u201c[T]he general understanding of\nrepublicanism across America\u201d at the founding embraced a concept of\ngovernment \u201cin which \u2018the people are sovereign\u2019; in which \u2018the\npeople are consequently the fountain of all power\u2019; in which \u2018all\nauthority should flow from the people\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Core to the 1950s\n\u201ccompact\u201d between the Federal Government and Puerto Rico was that\nPuerto Rico\u2019s eventual constitution \u201cshall provide a republican\nform of government.\u201d \u00a72, 64Stat. 319 (codified in 48\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7731c). Thus, \u201cresonant of American founding\nprinciples,\u201d the Puerto Rico Constitution set forth a tripartite\ngovernment \u201c\u00a0\u2018republican in form\u2019 and \u2018subordinate to the\nsovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico.\u2019\u00a0\u201dS\u00e1nchez\nValle, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting\nP.\u00a0R. Const., Art. I, \u00a72); see alsoTorresv.Puerto\nRico,442 U.S.\n465, 470 (1979). \u201c[T]he distinguishing feature\u201d of such\n\u201crepublican form of government,\u201d this Court has recognized over and\nagain, \u201cis the right of the people to choose their own officers for\ngovernmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of\nthe legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose\nlegitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves.\u201dIn\u00a0re Duncan,139 U.S.\n449, 461 (1891) (discussing the republican governments of the\nStates); see alsoPacific States Telephone & Telegraph\nCo.v.Oregon,223 U.S.\n118, 149 (1912) (same).Thus, whatever authority the Federal Government\nexercised to select territorial officers for Puerto Rico before\nCongress recognized Puerto Rico\u2019s republican form of government,\nthe authority \u201cto choose [Puerto Rico\u2019s] own officers for\ngovernmental administration\u201d now seems to belong to the people of\nPuerto Rico.Duncan, 139 U.\u00a0S., at 461. Indeed, however\ndirectly responsible the Federal Government was for Puerto Rico\u2019s\nlocal affairs before Public Law 600, those matters might be said to\n\u201cnow procee[d]\u201d in the first instance \u201cfrom the Puerto Rico\nConstitution as \u2018ordain[ed] and establish[ed]\u2019 by \u2018the\npeople.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Cf.S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(slip op., at 15) (quoting P.\u00a0R.

InCalero-Toledo, for instance,\nthis Court held that the \u201cenactments of the Commonwealth of Puerto\nRico\u201d were \u201c \u2018State statute[s]\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of a federal\nlaw requiring a three-judge court panel to consider any action\nseeking to enjoin a \u201c \u2018State statute.\u2019 \u201d 416 U.\u00a0S., at\n675\u2013676. The Court reasoned that Puerto Rico was entitled to\nsimilar treatment as the States under the federal law, due to\n\u201csignificant changes in Puerto Rico\u2019s governmental structure\u201d in\nthe early 1950s. Seeid., at 670\u2013674. For similar reasons,\nthis Court has recognized on multiple other occasions that Puerto\nRico is akin to a State in key respects. See,e.g.,Flores de Otero, 426 U.\u00a0S., at 597 (Congress granted\nPuerto Rico \u201ca measure of autonomy comparable to that possessed by\nthe States\u201d);Rodriguez, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 8 (\u201cPuerto Rico,\nlike a state, is an autonomous political entity\u201d); see alsoS\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 3) (\u201c[T]he parallels between admission of\nnew States and the creation of the Commonwealth [of Puerto Rico]\nare significant\u201d).The compact also had international\nramifications, as the Federal Government repeatedly represented at\nthe time. Shortly after the ratification and approval of the Puerto\nRico Constitution, federal officials certified to the United\nNations that, for Puerto Rico, the United States no longer needed\nto comply with certain reporting obligations under the United\nNations Charter regarding territories \u201cwhose peoples have not yet\nattained a full measure of self-government.\u201d Charter of the United\nNations, 59Stat. 1048, Art. 73, June 26, 1945, T.\u00a0S. No. 993\n(U.\u00a0N. Charter). According to federal officials, that was\nbecause the people of Puerto Rico now had \u201ccomplete autonomy in\ninternal economic matters and in cultural and social affairs under\na Constitution adopted by them and approved by the Congress.\u201d\nMemorandum by the Government of the United States of America\nConcerning the Cessation of Transmission of Information Under\nArticle 73(e) of the Charter With Regard to the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico, in A. Fern\u00f3s-Isern, Original Intent in the\nConstitution of Puerto Rico 153 (2d ed. 2002). To the extent\nfederal law had previously \u201cdirected or authorized interference\nwith matters of local government by the Federal Government,\u201d\nfederal officials elaborated, \u201c[t]hose laws .\u00a0.\u00a0. ha[d]\nbeen repealed.\u201dIbid.; see alsoibid.(\u201cCongress has\nagreed that Puerto Rico shall have, under [the Puerto Rico]\nConstitution, freedom from control or interference by the Congress\nin respect of internal government and administration\u201d).Based on those explicit representations, the\nUnited Nations General Assembly declared that the people of Puerto\nRico \u201cha[d] been invested with attributes of political sovereignty\nwhich clearly identify the status of self-government attained\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. as that of an autonomous political entity.\u201d\nG.\u00a0A. Res. 748, U.\u00a0N. GAOR, 8th Sess., Supp. No. 17,\nU.\u00a0N. Doc. A/2630 (Nov. 27, 1953). And consistent with that\ndeclaration, the Federal Government promptly stopped complying with\nthe Charter\u2019s reporting obligations with respect to Puerto Rico\n(and has never since recommenced). Thus, in the eyes of the\ninternational community looking in, as well as of the Federal\nGovernment looking out, Puerto Rico has long enjoyed autonomous\nreign over its internal affairs. Indeed, were the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s representations to the United Nations merely\naspirational, the United States\u2019 compliance with its international\nlegal obligations would be in substantial doubt. See Lawson &\nSloane, The Constitutionality of Decolonization by Associated\nStatehood: Puerto Rico\u2019s Legal Status Reconsidered, 50\nBoston\u00a0College L.\u00a0Rev. 1123, 1127 (2009) (arguing that if\nPuerto Rico remains \u201cjust another territory subject to Congress\u2019\nplenary power under the Territories Clause,\u201d \u201cthe United States\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. is in violation of its international legal\nobligations vis-\u00e0-vis Puerto Rico\u201d).There can be little question, then, that the\ncompact altered the relationship between the Federal Government and\nPuerto Rico. At a minimum, the post-compact developments, including\nthis Court\u2019s precedents, indicate that Congress placed in the hands\nof the Puerto Rican people the authority to establish their own\ngovernment, replete with officers of their own choosing, and that\nthis grant of self-government was not an empty promise. That\nhistory prompts serious questions as to whether the Board members\nmay be territorial officers of Puerto Rico when they are not\nelected or approved, directly or indirectly, by the people of\nPuerto Rico.BOf course, it might be argued that Congress is\nnevertheless free to repeal its grant of self-rule, including the\ngrant of authority to the island to select its own governmental\nofficers. And perhaps, it might further be said, that is exactly\nwhat Congress has done in PROMESA by declaring the Board \u201can entity\nwithin the territorial government\u201d of Puerto Rico. \u00a7101(c)(1),\n130Stat. 553. But that is not so certain.This Court has \u201c\u00a0\u2018repeatedly stated\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that absent \u201ca clearly expressed congressional\nintention\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d to repeal, \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a]n implied repeal\nwill only be found where provisions in two statutes are in\n\u201cirreconcilable conflict,\u201d or where the latter Act covers the whole\nsubject of the earlier one and \u201cis clearly intended as a\nsubstitute.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201dCarcieriv.Salazar,555 U.S.\n379, 395 (2009) (quotingBranchv.Smith,538 U.S.\n254, 273 (2003) (plurality opinion)). Not so, it seems, with\nPROMESA on the one hand, and Congress\u2019 1950 and 1952 legislations\non the other. As written, PROMESA is a temporary bankruptcy measure\nintended to assist in restoring Puerto Rico to fiscal security. It\nis not an organic statute clearly or expressly purporting to renege\non Congress\u2019 prior \u201cgran[t to] Puerto Rico [of] a measure of\nautonomy comparable to that possessed by the States,\u201dFlores de\nOtero, 426 U.\u00a0S., at 597, nor on the concomitant grant of\nauthority to select officers of its own choosing. It would seem\ncurious to interpret PROMESA as having done so indirectly, simply\nthrough its characterization of the Board \u201cas an entity within the\nterritorial government.\u201d \u00a7101(c)(1), 130Stat. 553.Further, there is a legitimate question whether\nCongress could validly repeal any element of its earlier compact\nwith Puerto Rico on its own initiative, even if it had been\nabundantly explicit in its intention to do so. The truism that \u201cone\nCongress cannot bind a later Congress,\u201dDorseyv.United\nStates,567 U.S.\n260, 274 (2012), appears to have its limits: As scholars have\nnoted, certain congressional actions are not subject to\nrecantation. See,e.g., Magruder, The Commonwealth Status of\nPuerto Rico, 15 U. Pitt. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 14 (1953) (listing as\nexamples the congressional grant of independence to the Philippine\nIslands and congressional grant of private title to public lands\nunder homestead laws); Issacharoff, 94 Ind. L.\u00a0J., at 14\n(\u201cOnce a Congress has disposed of a territory, of necessity it\nbinds future Congresses to the consequences of that decision\u201d); T.\nAleinikoff, Semblances of Sovereignty: The Constitution, the State,\nand American Citizenship 90 (2002) (\u201cThe granting of neither\nstatehood nor independence may be revoked, nor may land grants or\nother \u2018vested interests\u2019 be called back by a subsequent\nCongress\u201d).Plausible reasons may exist to treat Public Law\n600 and the Federal Government\u2019s recognition of Puerto Rico\u2019s\nsovereignty as similarly irrevocable, at least in the absence of\nmutual consent. Congress made clear in Public Law 600 that the\nagreement between the Federal Government and Puerto Rico was \u201cin\nthe nature of a compact.\u201d 64Stat. 319. That \u201csolemn undertaking,\nbased upon mutual consent, .\u00a0.\u00a0. of such profound\ncharacter between the Federal Government and a community of\nU.\u00a0S. citizens,\u201d has struck many as \u201cincompatible with the\nconcept of unilateral revocation.\u201dE.g., Report of the\nUnited States-Puerto Rico Commission on the Status of Puerto Rico\n12\u201313 (1966); see also A. Leibowitz, Defining Status: A\nComprehensive Analysis of United States Territorial Relations\n172\u2013173 (1989) (describing how \u201cmany in the Congress\u201d understood\nPublic Law 600 to constitute \u201can irrevocable grant of authority in\nlocal affairs with an understanding of mutual consent being\nrequired before Congress would resolve the ultimate status question\nor change the status of the Commonwealth\u201d). Indeed, shortly after\nCongress approved the Puerto Rico Constitution, federal officials\nexpressly represented to the United Nations that the compact was of\na \u201cbilateral nature,\u201d such that its \u201cterms [could] be changed only\nby common consent.\u201d F. Bolton, U.\u00a0S.\u00a0Rep. to the Gen.\nAssembly, Statement to U.\u00a0N. Committee IV (Trusteeship) (Nov.\n3, 1953), reprinted in 29 Dept. State Bull. 802, 804 (1953); see\nalso Press Release No. 1741, U.\u00a0S. Mission to the United\nNations, Statement by M. Sears, U.\u00a0S.\u00a0Rep. in the Comm.\non Information From Non-Self Governing Territories 2 (Aug. 28,\n1953) (\u201c[A] compact .\u00a0.\u00a0. is far stronger than a treaty\u201d\nbecause it \u201ccannot be denounced by either party unless it has the\npermission of the other\u201d).[3]All of this presses up against broader questions\nabout Congress\u2019 power under the Territories Clause of Article\nIV,U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. IV, \u00a73, cl.\u00a02, the\npurported source of legislative authority for enacting PROMESA, see\n\u00a7101(b)(2), 130 Stat. 553;ante, at 5. May Congress ever\nsimply cede its power under that Clause to legislate for the\nTerritories, and did it do so nearly 60 years ago with respect to\nPuerto Rico? If so, is PROMESA itself invalid, at least insofar as\nit holds itself out as an exercise of Territories Clause authority?\nThis Court has never squarely addressed such questions, except\nperhaps to acknowledge that Congress\u2019 authority under the\nTerritories Clause may \u201ccontinu[e] until granted away.\u201dNational\nBankv.County of Yankton,101 U.S.\n129, 133 (1880); cf.Cincinnati Soap Co.v.United\nStates,301 U.S.\n308, 319 (1937) (recognizing that a statute preparing the\nPhilippine Islands for independence from the United States \u201cbrought\nabout a profound change in the status of the islands and in their\nrelations to the United States,\u201d such that \u201cthe power of the United\nStates has been modified,\u201d even while \u201cit has not been\nabolished\u201d).After all, the Territories Clause provides\nCongress not only the power to \u201cmake all needful Rules and\nRegulations respecting the Territor[ies],\u201d but also the power to\n\u201cdispose of\u00a0\u201d them, which necessarily encompasses the power to\nrelinquish authority to legislate for them. U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\nIV, \u00a73, cl.\u00a02. And some have insisted that the power to cede\nauthority exists no less in the absence of full \u201cdispos[al]\u201d\nthrough independence or Statehood. See Aleinikoff, Semblances of\nSovereignty, at 77 (\u201cIt has been strongly argued that\u201d with \u201cthe\nestablishment of commonwealth status,\u201d \u201cCongress lost general power\nto regulate the internal affairs of Puerto Rico\u201d).Still, the parties here do not dispute Congress\u2019\nability to enact PROMESA under the Territories Clause in the first\nplace; nor does it seem strictly necessary to call that matter into\nquestion to resolve the Appointments Clause concern presented here.\nDespite the \u201cfull measure of self-government\u201d the island supposedly\nenjoys, U.\u00a0N. Charter, Art. 73; see alsosupra, at 4\u20135,\n9\u201312, Puerto Rico can well remain a \u201cTerritory\u201d subject to some\nmeasure of Congress\u2019 Territories Clause authority. But even\nassuming that the Territories Clause thus enables Congress to enact\nfederal laws \u201crespecting\u201d Puerto Rico, U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. IV,\n\u00a73, cl.\u00a02, still some things the Clause does not necessarily\ndo:\u00a0 It does not necessarily allow Congress to repeal by mere\nimplication its prior grant of authority to the people of Puerto\nRico to choose their own governmental officers. It does not\nnecessarily give Congress license to revoke unilaterally an\ninstrument that may be altered only with mutual consent. And it\ndoes not necessarily permit Congress to declare by fiat that the\nlaw must treat its exercise of authority under the Territories\nClause as territorial rather than federal, irrespective of the\ncompact it entered with the people of Puerto Rico leaving complete\nterritorial authority to them. Cf. Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n, The Evolution\nof Democratic Governance Under the Territorial Clause of the\nU.\u00a0S. Constitution, 50 Suffolk U. L.\u00a0Rev. 587, 605 (2017)\n(after 1952, \u201cCongress partially relinquished its territorial\npowers over Puerto Rico\u2019sinternalaffairs, as recognized inSanchez Valle,\u201d even while \u201cCongress continues to retain\nterritorial powers infederalaffairs\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).IIINor is it significant that Congress has\nhistorically provided for the appointment of officers who perform\nduties related to the Territories through methods other than those\nprescribed by the Appointments Clause. Those methods may be\npermissible up to a point in a Territory\u2019s development. But that\nhistorical practice does not, in my view, resolve the far more\ncomplex question whether Congress can continue to act in that\nmanner indefinitely or long after granting Territories complete\nself-government.Essentially none (if any) of the allegedly\nnonconforming appointments referenced by the parties occurred in\ncircumstances where, as in the case of Puerto Rico, Congress\npreviously granted the Territories complete home rule. Seeinfra, at 18\u201319, and nn.\u00a04\u20135. Instead, they largely\noccurred during the initial or transitional stages of a Territory\u2019s\nexistence, when often the terms of the organic statute establishing\nthe Territory expressly provided for the Federal Government to act\non behalf of the Territory. (After all, in newly established\nTerritories, no recognized territorial government existed until the\norganic statute established one.) Because in that state of affairs,\nan organic statute plainly contemplated thatCongresshad\nauthority to establish offices for the Territory, such\ncongressionally established offices could fairly\u2014indeed,\nnecessarily\u2014be treated as \u201cterritorial\u201d to the extent they were\ntasked with territorial duties.Does that necessarily remain the case if\nCongress later grants or establishes complete territorial\nself-government? As Puerto Rico\u2019s history may demonstrate, it is\nseemingly at that point that Congress purports to recognize that\nthe Territory itself (not the Federal Government) wields authority\nover matters of the Territory, including the ability to select its\nown territorial officers. Perhaps it is also at that point that a\ndistinction between territorial officers and federal officers\ncrystallizes:\u00a0\u00a0Territorial officers are those who derive\ntheir authority from the people of the Territory; federal officers\nare those who derive their authority from the Federal Government.\nAnd here, the Board members indisputably are selected by the\nFederal Government, under a statute passed by Congress that\nspecifies not just their governance responsibilities but also the\npriorities of their decisionmaking. Seeante, at 3\u20134.The scores of historical vignettes highlighted\nby petitioners, see,e.g., Brief for Petitioner Financial\nOversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico 28\u201333; Brief for\nPetitioner Official Committee of Retired Employees of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico 10\u201317, do not appear to foreclose this\npossibility or even address the question. Rather, they seem\nconsistent with a broader historical narrative about early\nterritorial development: that Congress has traditionally exercised\nits power under the Territories Clause with the aim of promptly\npreparing newly established Territories to transition gradually to\nterritorial self-government. To the extent Congress deviated from\nthe requirements of the Appointments Clause in establishing\nterritorial governments, it generally did so either to facilitate\ntemporary governments in the Territories before self-government was\npractically possible or to begin transferring appointment authority\ndirectly into the hands of the territorial population.For example, Congress has often provided for\nterritorial officials to be appointed by a (Presidentially\nnominated and Senate confirmed) territorial Governor, a method that\nthe Appointments Clause does not appear to contemplate. See,e.g., Brief for Petitioner Financial Oversight and\nManagement Board for Puerto Rico 31, and n.\u00a013. But those\narrangements arose from the organic statutes establishing the\nTerritories (and thus their initial territorial governments) in the\nfirst place.[4] The same is\ngenerally true of instances where Congress provided for\nPresidential appointment (without Senate confirmation) of\nterritorial officials whose duties might otherwise make them\nprincipal officers under the Appointments Clause (requiring Senate\nconfirmation). See,e.g., Brief for Petitioner Official\nCommittee of Retired Employees of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n11. Those scenarios broadly conformed with the template of the\norganic statute establishing the Louisiana Territory, 2Stat. 245,\nwhich Congress passed as an \u201cemergency provisio[n]\u201d shortly after\nterritorial acquisition in order \u201cto preserve order until a proper\ngovernment could be put in place,\u201d D. Currie, The Constitution in\nCongress, The Jeffersonians: 1801\u20131829, p.\u00a0112\n(2001).[5]As for the numerous instances where officers\nwith territorial responsibilities were popularly elected or\nappointed by territorial officials, seeante, at 11,\nCongress typically transitioned to these arrangements after\nestablishing an initial territorial government. The Northwest\nOrdinance, for example, allowed the Governor to appoint\n\u201cmagistrates and other civil officers\u201d \u201cduring the continuance of\n[a] temporary government\u201d established at the outset of the\nNorthwest Territory\u2019s existence, as \u201cnecessary for the preservation\nof the peace and good order.\u201d Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1Stat.\n51, n.\u00a0(a). As soon as the Territory met a certain\npopulation threshold, however, the territorial population was to\ndirectly elect members of the lower house of the territorial\nlegislature, which would in turn play a role in selecting the civil\nofficers of the territorial government.Ibid.Following the\nNorthwest Ordinance\u2019s lead, the organic statutes for many\nsubsequent territories contemplated similararrangements for \u201ctransition[ing]\u201d quickly to\nforms of \u201crepresentative government.\u201d J. Eblen, The First and\nSecond United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government\n1784\u20131912, pp. 54, 59 (1968); see also Leibowitz, Defining Status,\nat 6\u20137.Congress\u2019 provision of limited or incremental\nhome-rule measures, moreover, seems to reveal little about the\nrestrictions the Appointments Clause imposes on officers selected\nby the Federal Government. By definition, selection by home rule\ndoes not track the methods outlined in the Appointments Clause. But\nperhaps that is because home-rule measures give to the Territory\nthe ability to select its own governing officers, which by\nnecessity are territorial rather than federal. That the Territory\nselects its own governing officers, and that these officers are\nnecessarily territorial, does not obviously imply that Congress may\ndisregard the Appointments Clause when it later provides for the\nFederal Government to select officers carrying out territorial\nresponsibilities.[6]In all, then, it is not particularly surprising\nthat many officers who acted for the Territories historically were\nappointed in a manner other than that set out in the Appointments\nClause. Viewed in proper historical context, those officers\u2019\nappointments may reflect nothing more than the necessary incidents\nof the transition to and establishment of full territorial\nself-government. For the overwhelming majority of Territories in\nthis Nation\u2019s history, of course, that turning point coincided with\nStatehood. See Leibowitz, Defining Status, at 6\u20138 (describing the\n\u201ctransitory nature\u201d of the early Territories\u2019 \u201cevolutionary process\nculminat[ing]in Statehood\u201d and \u201cthe establishment of popular\nself-government\u201d);District of Columbiav.Carter,409 U.S.\n418, 431\u2013432 (1973) (\u201cFrom the moment of their creation, the\nTerritories were destined for admission as States into the Union,\nand \u2018as a preliminary step toward that foreordained end\u2014to tide\nover the period of ineligibility\u2014Congress, from time to time,\ncreated territorial governments, the existence of which was\nnecessarily limited\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingO\u2019Donoghuev.United\nStates,289 U.S.\n516, 537 (1933))). But critically, the transitional phase was\nnever intended to last indefinitely. See Amar, America\u2019s\nConstitution, at 273 (describing the Founders\u2019 understanding that\n\u201c[t]he older states would help their younger siblings grow up and\nwould thereafter regard them as equals, rather than as permanent\nadolescents\u2014the status to which Mother England had wrongly\nrelegated her own New World wards\u201d). The historical examples thus\nreveal little, if anything, about Congress\u2019 ability to establish\nterritorial officers in Territories that (much like Puerto Rico)\nhave long operated under the full measure of self-government.This Court\u2019s precedents do not speak to that\ncircumstance either. No doubt the Court has said that the\nTerritories Clause gives Congress \u201cfull and complete legislative\nauthority over the people of the Territories and all the\ndepartments of the territorial governments.\u201dCounty of\nYankton, 101 U.\u00a0S., at 132\u2013133; see alsoid., at\n133 (\u201cCongress may not only abrogate laws of the territorial\nlegislatures, but it may itself legislate directly for the local\ngovernment\u201d);Serev.Pitot, 6 Cranch 332, 337\n(1810);ante, at 3\u20134 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).\nBut none of those cases had to do with the Appointments Clause.\nMore important, none of them addressed the scope of Congress\u2019\nauthority with respect to a fully self-governing Territory. See\nLeibowitz, Defining Status, at 15 (observing that \u201cthe broad\nstatements of Congressional power\u201d in those cases \u201cwere made in the\ncontext of a territory\u2019s evolution toward statehood,\u201d and that\n\u201c[t]his context was the \u2018restriction .\u00a0.\u00a0. necessarily\nimplied in its terms\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Much less do those cases inform\nwhether and how Congress may validly act on behalf of a Territory\nlike Puerto Rico, as to which Congress has expressly (and perhaps\nirrevocably in the absence of common consent) \u201crelinquished\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. control over .\u00a0.\u00a0.

Indeed, as the same\ncases expressly acknowledged, Congress\u2019 authority under the\nTerritories Clause may \u201ccontinu[e]\u201d only \u201cuntil granted away.\u201dCounty of Yankton, 101 U.\u00a0S., at 133; see alsosupra, at 15\u201316.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*These cases raise serious questions about\nwhen, if ever, the Federal Government may constitutionally exercise\nauthority to establish territorial officers in a Territory like\nPuerto Rico, where Congress seemingly ceded that authority long ago\nto Puerto Rico itself. The 1950s compact between the Federal\nGovernment and Puerto Rico undoubtedly carried ramifications for\nPuerto Rico\u2019s status under federal and international law; the same\nmay be true of the Appointments Clause analysis here. After all,\nthe long-awaited promise of Public Law 600\u2019s compact between Puerto\nRico and the Federal Government seemed to be that the people of\nPuerto Rico may choose their own territorial officers, rather than\nhave such officers foisted on the Territory by the Federal\nGovernment.Viewed against that backdrop, the result of\nthese cases seems anomalous. The Board members, tasked with\ndetermining the financial fate of a self-governing Territory, exist\nin a twilight zone of accountability, neither selected by Puerto\nRico itself nor subject to the strictures of the Appointments\nClause. I am skeptical that the Constitution countenances this\nfreewheeling exercise of control over a population that the Federal\nGovernment has explicitly agreed to recognize as operating under a\ngovernment of their own choosing, pursuant to a constitution of\ntheir own choosing. Surely our Founders, having labored to attain\nsuch recognition of self-determination, would not view that same\nrecognition with respect to Puerto Rico as a mere act of grace.\nNevertheless, because these issues are not properly presented in\nthese cases, I reluctantly concur in the judgment.Notes1To be sure, Public Law\n600 reserved certain limited powers to Congress (some of which were\nsoon repealed). Seeante, at 12\u201313. But those narrow\nreservations of federal control did not purport to diminish the\nfull measure of territorial self-governance conferred upon the\npeople of Puerto Rico through Public Law 600 and the Puerto Rico\nConstitution. See 39Stat. 953; 64Stat. 319\u2013320.2Specifically, PROMESA\nprovides that \u201c[t]he Board shall be comprised of one Category A\nmember, one Category B member, two Category C members, one Category\nD member, one Category E member, and one Category F member.\u201d\n\u00a7101(e)(1)(B), 130Stat. 554.

When Congress enacted the\nNorthwest Ordinance prior to Ratification to govern the newly\nacquired Northwest Territory, it provided for a catalog of\nfundamental rights, styled as \u201carticles of compact between the\noriginal States and the people and States in the said territory\u201d\nthat would \u201cforever remain unalterable, unless by common consent.\u201d\nAct of Aug. 7, 1789, 1Stat. 52, n.\u00a0(a) (reproducing the\nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787). That understanding of a compact\nbetween the Federal Government and the Territories was the only\nextant precedent for the compact language in Public Law 600, and\nproponents of Public Law 600 were vocal in their reliance on the\nNorthwest Ordinance as a model. See Lawson & Sloane, The\nConstitutionality of Decolonization by Associated Statehood: Puerto\nRico\u2019s Legal Status Reconsidered, 50 Boston College L. Rev. 1123,\n1149, n.\u00a0142 (2009) (prior to Public Law 600, \u201c[t]he term\n\u2018compact\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. had seldom appeared in U.\u00a0S. law,\u201d\nwith the exception of the Northwest Ordinance and subsequent\norganic statutes modeled after the Northwest Ordinance); J.
