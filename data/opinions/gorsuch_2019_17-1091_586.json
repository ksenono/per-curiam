    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 17\u20131091_________________TYSON TIMBS, PETITIONERv.INDIANAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nindiana[February 20, 2019]Justice Gorsuch, concurring.The majority faithfully applies our precedent\nand, based on a wealth of historical evidence, concludes that the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive\nFines Clause against the States. I agree with that conclusion. As\nan original matter, I acknowledge, the appropriate vehicle for\nincorporation may well be the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or\nImmunities Clause, rather than, as this Court has long assumed, the\nDue Process Clause. See,e.g.,post, at 1\u20133 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring in judgment);McDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S.\n742, 805\u2013858 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (documenting evidence that the \u201cprivileges\nor immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d include, at\nminimum, the individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights);\nWildenthal, Nationalizing the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the\nOriginal Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866\u201367, 68\nOhio St. L. J. 1509 (2007); A. Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation\nand Reconstruction 163\u2013214 (1998); M. Curtis, No State Shall\nAbridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights (1986).\nBut nothing in this case turns on that question, and, regardless of\nthe precise vehicle, there can be no serious doubt that the\nFourteenth Amendment requires the States to respect the freedom\nfrom excessive fines enshrined in the Eighth Amendment.",
