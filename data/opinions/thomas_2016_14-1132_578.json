I agree that this suit belongs in state court,\nbut I would rest that conclusion on the statute before us, \u00a727 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778aa.\nThat statute does not use the phrase \u201carising under\u201d or provide a\nsound basis for adopting the arising-under standard. It instead\nprovides federal jurisdiction where a suit is \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d\nExchange Act requirements. \u00a778aa(a). That language establishes a\nstraightforward test: If a complaint alleges a claim that\nnecessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the\nAct, \u00a727 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit.\nBecause the complaint here does not allege such claims\u2014and because\nno other statute confers federal jurisdiction\u2014this suit should\nreturn to state court. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.IASection 27 provides that \u201c[t]he district\ncourts .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall have exclusive jurisdiction\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. of all suits in equity and actions at law brought\nto enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the\nrules and regulations thereunder.\u201d \u00a778aa(a).[1]* As the Court explains, under a \u201cnatural\nreading,\u201d \u00a727 \u201cconfers federal jurisdiction when an action is\ncommenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement.\u201dAnte,at 6; see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\nof the English Language 725 (1927) (\u201cenforce\u201d means \u201cgive force to\u201d\nor \u201cgive effect to\u201d). And by providing \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to\nfederal district courts over certain suits, \u00a727 strips state courts\nof jurisdiction over such suits.Put differently, under \u00a727 a suit belongs in\nfederal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an\nExchange Act duty or liability. In contrast, a suit belongs in\nstate court when the complaint \u201cassert[s] purely state-law causes\nof action\u201d that do not require \u201cbinding legal determinations of\nrights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\u201d or \u201ca judgment on\nthe merits of\u201d an Exchange Act breach.Matsushita Elec.\nIndustrial Co.v.Epstein, 516 U.\u00a0S. 367, 382, 384\n(1996) . Such a suit is \u201cnot \u2018brought to enforce\u2019 any rights or\nobligations under the Act,\u201d and thus does not fall within \u00a727\u2019s\nscope.Id., at 381. So \u00a727 does not provide federal\njurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties\nunder state law or over every case that happens to involve\nallegations that the Act was violated. The provision leaves state\ncourts with some authority over suits involving the Act or its\nregulations.The statutory context bolsters this\nunderstanding. That context confirms that Congress reserved some\nauthority to state courts to adjudicate securities-law\nmatters.Although the Act provides numerous federal \u201crights and\nremedies,\u201d it also generally preserves \u201call other rights and\nremedies that may exist at law or in equity,\u201d such as claims that\ncould be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction. 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778bb(a)(2). That provision shows that \u201cCongress\nplainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state\nand federal courts relating to securities transactions.\u201dMatsushita,supra,at 383. A natural reading of \u00a727\u2019s\ntext preserves the dual role for federal and state courts that\nCongress contemplated, and it confirms that mere allegations of\nExchange Act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of\njurisdiction.A natural reading promotes the uniform\ninterpretation of the federal securities laws that Congress sought\nto ensure when it gave federal courts \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over\nfederal securities-law suits. \u00a778aa(a). The textual approach\nfosters uniformity because it leaves to federal courts\u2014which are\npresumptively more familiar with the intricate federal securities\nlaws\u2014the task of \u201cadjudicat[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. Exchange Act\nclaims.\u201dMatsushita, 516 U.\u00a0S., at 383. When state\ncourts decide cases where the complaint pleads only state-law\nclaims and do not resolve the merits of Exchange Act rights or\nliabilities, they are not \u201ctrespass[ing] upon the exclusive\nterritory of the federal courts.\u201dId.,at 382.The statutory text and structure thus support a\nstraightforward test: Section 27 confers federal jurisdiction over\na case if the complaint alleges claims that necessarily depend on\nestablishing a breach of an Exchange Act requirement.BThe Third Circuit was correct to remand this\nsuit to state court. Respondents\u2019 complaint does not seek \u201cto\nenforce any liability or duty created by\u201d the Exchange Act or its\nregulations. \u00a778aa(a).Although respondents\u2019 complaint alleges at\ndifferent places that petitioners violated the Exchange Act or its\nregulations, the complaint does not bring claims requiring\nenforcement of the Exchange Act or its regulations. The complaint\ninstead brings 10 state-law causes of action that seek to enforce\nduties and liabilities created by state law. Count 2 alleges that\npetitioners violated state law by investing money derived from\nracketeering. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a\u201393a, Amended Complaint\n\u00b6\u00b6114\u2013122 (citing N.\u00a0J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:41\u20132a (West 2005)).\nCounts 3 through 9 allege standard state-law contract and tort\nclaims: unjust enrichment, unlawful interference with economic\nadvantage, tortious interference with contractual relations,\nunlawful interference with contractual relations,\nthird-party-beneficiary claims, breach of the covenant of good\nfaith and fair dealing, and negligence. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n93a\u2013101a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6123\u2013158. Count 10 pleads a\nfreestanding claim for punitive and exemplary damages. Seeid.,at 101a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6159\u2013161. None of these\nclaims requires a court to \u201cenforce\u201d\u2014to give effect to\u2014a\nrequirement created by the Act, thus, \u00a727 does not confer federal\njurisdiction over them.Count 1 presents a closer call, but it too does\nnot trigger federal jurisdiction. That count pleads that\npetitioners violated a state law that makes it unlawful for a\nperson to participate in a racketeering enterprise.Id.,at\n82a\u201390a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b688\u2013113 (citing N.\u00a0J. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a72C:41\u20132c). The alleged racketeering includes violating the New\nJersey Uniform Securities Law (through fraud, deception, and\nmisappropriation), committing \u201ctheft by taking\u201d under state law,\nand committing \u201ctheft by deception\u201d under state law. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 82a\u201390a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b688\u2013113. Respondents allege\nthat \u201c[t]he SEC has expressly noted that naked short selling\ninvolves the omission of a material fact\u201d as part of their\nstate-law securities fraud allegation.Id.,at 85a, Amended\nComplaint \u00b6100. Vindicating that claim would not require the\nenforcement of a federal duty or liability. New Jersey law\nencompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a\nviolation of federal law or regulation. See,e.g.,\n\u00a749:3\u201349(e)(1) (West 2001) (fraud and deceit include \u201c[a]ny\nmisrepresentation by word, conduct or in any manner of any material\nfact, either present or past, and any omission to disclose any such\nfact\u201d); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a\u201386a (invoking \u00a749:3\u201349et\u00a0seq.). So although Count 1 refers to the Securities\nand Exchange Commission\u2019s view about naked short selling, that\ncount does not require respondents to establish a violation of\nfederal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim. Because\nrespondents\u2019 cause of action in Count 1 seeks to enforce duties and\nliabilities created by state law and does not necessarily depend on\nthe breach of an Exchange Act duty or liability, \u00a727 does not\nprovide federal jurisdiction over that claim.IIAlthough the Court acknowledges the \u201cnatural\nreading\u201d of \u00a727,ante,at 6, it holds that \u00a727 adopts the\njurisdictional test that this Court uses to evaluate\nfederal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.\nSeeante,at 8\u201310; see alsoante,at 10\u201318. Federal\ncourts have the power to review cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law,\n\u00a71331, including those in which the complaint brings state-law\nclaims that \u201cnecessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually\ndisputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain\nwithout disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal\nand state judicial responsibilities.\u201dGrable & Sons Metal\nProducts, Inc.v.Darue Engineering & Mfg.,545\nU.\u00a0S. 308, 314 (2005) . The Court wrongly equates the phrase\n\u201carising under\u201d in \u00a71331 with the phrase \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d in\n\u00a727, and interprets the latter to require that a case raising\nstate-law claims \u201cmee[t] the \u2018arising under\u2019 standard\u201d for that\ncase to proceed in federal court.Ante,at 8; seeante,at 8\u20139. None of the Court\u2019s rationales for adopting\nthat rule is persuasive.AThe Court first argues that \u201cit is impossible\nto infer that Congress, in enacting \u00a727, wished to depart from what\nwe now understand as the \u2018arising under\u2019 standard\u201d because there\nwas no \u201cwell-defined test\u201d to depart from.Ante,at 10. The\nCourt\u2019s case law construing \u00a71331, the Court explains, \u201cwas for\nmany decades\u2014including when the Exchange Act passed\u2014highly unruly.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted).But when Congress enacts a statute that uses\ndifferent language from a prior statute, we normally presume that\nCongress did so to convey a different meaning. See,e.g.,Crawfordv.Burke, 195 U.\u00a0S. 176, 190 (1904)\n(explaining that \u201ca change in phraseology creates a presumption of\na change in intent\u201d and that \u201cCongress would not have used such\ndifferent language [in two statutes] without thereby intending a\nchange of meaning\u201d). Given what we know about \u00a71331, that\npresumption has force here. Our \u00a71331 case law was, as the Court\nnotes, \u201chighly unruly\u201d when the Exchange Act was enacted in 1934.\nGiven the importance of clarity in jurisdictional statutes, seeHertz Corp.v.Friend, 559 U.\u00a0S. 77, 94 (2010) ,\nit is quite a stretch to infer that Congress wished to embrace such\nan unpredictable test.That is especially true given that \u00a727 does not\nuse words supporting the convoluted arising-under standard. Section\n27 does not ask (for example) whether a federal issue is\nsubstantial or whether a ruling on that issue will upset the\ncongressionally approved balance of federal and state power.\nIndeed, \u00a71331itselfdoes not even use words supporting the\narising-under standard. Seeante,at 10 (acknowledging that\nthe arising-under standard \u201cdoes not turn on \u00a71331\u2019s text\u201d).\nRather, the Court has refused to give full effect to \u00a71331\u2019s\n\u201cbroa[d] phras[ing]\u201d and has instead \u201ccontinuously construed and\nlimited\u201d that provision based on extratextual considerations, such\nas \u201chistory,\u201d \u201cthe demands of reason and coherence,\u201d and \u201csound\njudicial policy.\u201dRomerov.International Terminal\nOperating Co., 358 U.\u00a0S. 354, 379 (1959) . Faced with a\nplain and focused text like \u00a727, however, we should not rely on\nsuch considerations. And importing factors from our \u00a71331\narising-under jurisprudence\u2014such as a substantiality requirement\nand a federal-state balance requirement\u2014risks narrowing the class\nof cases that Congress meant to cover with \u00a727\u2019s plain text. For\nthese reasons, it is unwise to read into \u00a727 a decision to adopt\nthe arising-under standard.BThe Court next relies on two prior\ndecisions\u2014Pan American Petroleum Corp.v.Superior Court\nof Del. for New Castle Cty., 366 U.\u00a0S. 656 (1961) , andMatsushita,516 U.\u00a0S. 367. Seeante,at 10\u201314.\nNeither case justifies the Court\u2019s decision to apply the\narising-under standard to \u00a727.InPan American, the Court held that\nDelaware state courts had jurisdiction over state-law contract\nclaims that arose from contracts for the sale of natural gas. 366\nU.\u00a0S., at 662\u2013665. The Court reached that decision even though\na provision of the Natural Gas Act provided exclusive federal\njurisdiction over suits \u201c\u00a0\u2018brought to enforce any liability or\nduty created by\u2019\u00a0\u201d that Act.Id.,at 662 (quoting\nstatute).Pan Americanlends some support to the Court\u2019s\nview today. It applied the Court\u2019s arising-under precedents and\n\u201cexplained that [the Natural Gas Act\u2019s] use of the term \u2018brought to\nenforce,\u2019 rather than \u2018arising under,\u2019 made no difference to the\njurisdictional analysis.\u201dAnte,at 11; seePan\nAmerican,supra, at 665, n.\u00a02; see alsoante,at 10\u201313.ButPan Americandoes not require the\nCourt to engraft the arising-under standard onto \u00a727.Pan\nAmericandid not carefully analyze the Natural Gas Act\u2019s text\nor assess the contemporary meaning of the central phrase \u201cbrought\nto enforce.\u201d Instead, the Court relied on legislative history,\nreasoning that \u201cauthoritative [congressional] Committee Reports\u201d\nimplied a limitation on the Natural Gas Act\u2019s jurisdictional text.\n366 U.\u00a0S., at 665, n.\u00a02. That reasoning does not warrant\nour respect. That is especially true becausePan American\u2019s\nholding is consistent with the Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cbrought to\nenforce\u201d language. The complaint in that case did not \u201casser[t]\u201d\nany \u201cright .\u00a0.\u00a0. under the Natural Gas Act\u201d and instead\nasked the court to adjudicate standard state-law \u201ccontract or\nquasi-contract\u201d claims.Id.,at 663, 664. The Court\u2019s\ndisposition inPan Americanrests as comfortably on the\nstatutory text as it does on the arising-under standard.Matsushitaprovides even less support for\nthe Court\u2019s holding today. In that case the Court held that\nDelaware courts could issue a judgment approving a settlement\nreleasing securities-law claims even though the settlement released\nclaims that were (by virtue of \u00a727) \u201csolely within the jurisdiction\nof the federal courts.\u201d 516 U.\u00a0S., at 375; seeid.,at\n370\u2013372. The Court explained that, \u201c[w]hile \u00a727 prohibits state\ncourts from adjudicating claims arising under the Exchange Act, it\ndoes not prohibit state courts from approving the release of\nExchange Act claims in the settlement of suits over which they have\nproperly exercised jurisdiction,i.e.,suits arising under\nstate law or under federal law for which there is concurrent\njurisdiction.\u201dId.,at 381. Because the complaint in that\ncase \u201cassert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\u201d and the state\ncourts did not issue \u201ca judgment on the merits of the [exclusively\nfederal] claims,\u201d \u00a727 did not deprive state courts of jurisdiction.Id.,at 382.The Court relies onMatsushitabecause in\nthat case we three times \u201cdescribed\u201d \u00a727 \u201cas conferring exclusive\njurisdiction of suits \u2018arising under\u2019 the Exchange Act.\u201dAnte,at 13 (citing 516 U.\u00a0S., at 380, 381, 385). ButMatsushitadid not decide whether \u00a727 adopts the\narising-under standard, so its passing use of the phrase \u201carising\nunder\u201d cannot bear the weight that the Court now places on it. To\nbe sure,Matsushitadoes support the Court\u2019sjudgmenttoday:Matsushitaemphasized that state courts could\nadjudicate a suit involving securities-law issues where the\ncomplaint \u201cassert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\u201d and did\nnot require the state courts to issue \u201cbinding legal determinations\nof rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\u201d or \u201ca judgment on\nthe merits of\u201d an Exchange Act breach.Id., at 382, 384. But\nthose statements are more consistent with \u00a727\u2019s text than they are\nwith the arising-under standard. Seesupra,at 2\u20133 (invokingMatsushita).CFinally, the Court argues that its\ninterpretation \u201cserves the goals\u201d that our precedents have\n\u201cconsistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional\nstatutes\u201d\u2014affording proper deference to state courts and promoting\nadministrable jurisdictional rules.Ante,at 14; seeante, at 14\u201318. But hewing to \u00a727\u2019s text serves these goals\nas well as or better than does adopting the arising-under\nstandard.First, the text-based view preserves state\ncourts\u2019 authority to adjudicate numerous securities-law claims and\nprovide relief consistent with the Exchange Act\u2019s design. Seesupra,at 1\u20133. As explained above, that view places all of\nrespondents\u2019 state-law causes of action in state court. Seesupra,at 3\u20135. The text-based view thus \u201cdecline[s] to\nconstrue [a] federal jurisdictional statut[e] more expansively than\n[its] language, most fairly read, requires.\u201dAnte,at\n14.Second, the textual test is also more\nadministrable than the arising-under standard. The arising-under\nstandard \u201cis anything but clear.\u201dGrable, 545 U.\u00a0S., at\n321 (Thomas, J., concurring). The standard involves numerous\njudgments about matters of degree that are not readily susceptible\nto bright lines. As noted, to satisfy that standard, a state-law\nclaim must raise a federal issue that is (among other things)\n\u201cactually disputed,\u201d is \u201csubstantial,\u201d and will not \u201cdistur[b]\u201d a\ncongressionally approved federal-state \u201cbalance.\u201dId.,at\n314 (opinion of Court). The standard \u201ccalls for a \u2018common-sense\naccommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations\u2019 that\npresent a federal issue, in \u2018a selective process which picks the\nsubstantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones\naside.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 313 (quotingGullyv.First\nNat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U.\u00a0S. 109 \u2013118 (1936)). The\narising-under standard may be many things, but it is not one that\nconsistently \u201cprovides ready answers\u201d to hard jurisdictional\nquestions.Ante,at 17. The text-based view promises better.\nI would adopt that view and apply it here.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.Notes1*\u00a0As the Court explains,\nthe parties have not pressed us to construe \u00a727\u2019s language\nconferring jurisdiction over \u201cviolations\u201d of the Exchange Act, its\nrules, or its regulations. Seeante,at 5, n.\u00a02. Like\nthe Court, I focus on \u00a727\u2019s \u201cbrought to enforce\u201d\nlanguage.",
