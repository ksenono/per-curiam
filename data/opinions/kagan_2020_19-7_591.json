    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 19\u20137_________________SEILA LAW LLC, PETITIONERv.CONSUMER\nFINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAUon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 29, 2020]Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg,\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring in the\njudgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part.Throughout the Nation\u2019s history, this Court has\nleft most decisions about how to structure the Executive Branch to\nCongress and the President, acting through legislation they both\nagree to. In particular, the Court has commonly allowed those two\nbranches to create zones of administrative independence by limiting\nthe President\u2019s power to remove agency heads. The Federal Reserve\nBoard. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The National Labor\nRelations Board. Statute after statute establishing such entities\ninstructs the President that he may not discharge their directors\nexcept for cause\u2014most often phrased as inefficiency, neglect of\nduty, or malfeasance in office. Those statutes, whose language the\nCourt has repeatedly approved, provide the model for the removal\nrestriction before us today. If precedent were any guide, that\nprovision would have survived its encounter with this Court\u2014and so\nwould the intended independence of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB).Our Constitution and history demand that result.\nThe text of the Constitution allows these common for-cause removal\nlimits. Nothing in it speaks of removal. And it grants Congress\nauthority to organize all the institutions of American governance,\nprovided only that those arrangements allow the President to\nperform his own constitutionally assigned duties. Still more, the\nFramers\u2019 choice to give the political branches wide discretion over\nadministrative offices has played out through American history in\nways that have settled the constitutional meaning. From the first,\nCongress debated and enacted measures to create spheres of\nadministration\u2014especially of financial affairs\u2014detached from direct\npresidential control. As the years passed, and governance became\never more complicated, Congress continued to adopt and adapt such\nmeasures\u2014confident it had latitude to do so under a Constitution\nmeant to \u201cendure for ages to come.\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819) (approving the Second\nBank of the United States). Not every innovation in governance\u2014not\nevery experiment in administrative independence\u2014has proved\nsuccessful. And debates about the prudence of limiting the\nPresident\u2019s control over regulatory agencies, including through his\nremoval power, have never abated.[1] But the Constitution\u2014both as originally drafted and as\npracticed\u2014mostly leaves disagreements about administrative\nstructure to Congress and the President, who have the knowledge and\nexperience needed to address them. Within broad bounds, it keeps\nthe courts\u2014who do not\u2014out of the picture.The Court today fails to respect its proper\nrole. It recognizes that this Court has approved limits on the\nPresident\u2019s removal power over heads of agencies much like the\nCFPB. Agencies possessing similar powers, agencies charged with\nsimilar missions, agencies created for similar reasons. The\nmajority\u2019s explanation is that the heads of those agencies fall\nwithin an \u201cexception\u201d\u2014one for multimember bodies and another for\ninferior officers\u2014to a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of unrestricted presidential\nremoval power.Ante,at 13. And the majority says the CFPB\nDirector does not. That account, though, is wrong in every respect.\nThe majority\u2019s general rule does not exist. Its exceptions,\nlikewise, are made up for the occasion\u2014gerrymandered so the CFPB\nfalls outside them. And the distinction doing most of the\nmajority\u2019s work\u2014between multimember bodies and single\ndirectors\u2014does not respond to the constitutional values at stake.\nIf a removal provision violates the separation of powers, it is\nbecause the measure so deprives the President of control over an\nofficial as to impede his own constitutional functions. But with or\nwithout a for-cause removal provision, the President has at least\nas much control over an individual as over a commission\u2014and\npossibly more. That means the constitutional concern is, if\nanything, ameliorated when the agency has a single head.\nUnwittingly, the majority shows why courts should stay their hand\nin these matters. \u201cCompared to Congress and the President, the\nJudiciary possesses an inferior understanding of the realities of\nadministration\u201d and the way \u201cpolitical power[\u00a0] operates.\u201dFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd.,561 U.S.\n477, 523 (2010) (Breyer, J., dissenting).In second-guessing the political branches, the\nmajority second-guesses as well the wisdom of the Framers and the\njudgment of history. It writes in rules to the Constitution that\nthe drafters knew well enough not to put there. It repudiates the\nlessons of American experience, from the 18th century to the\npresent day. And it commits the Nation to a static version of\ngovernance, incapable of responding to new conditions and\nchallenges. Congress and the President established the CFPB to\naddress financial practices that had brought on a devastating\nrecession, and could do so again. Today\u2019s decision wipes out a\nfeature of that agency its creators thought fundamental to its\nmission\u2014a measure of independence from political pressure. I\nrespectfully dissent.IThe text of the Constitution, the history of\nthe country, the precedents of this Court, and the need for sound\nand adaptable governance\u2014all stand against the majority\u2019s opinion.\nThey point not to the majority\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u201cunrestricted\nremoval power\u201d with two grudgingly applied \u201cexceptions.\u201dAnte,at 13, 16. Rather, they bestow discretion on the\nlegislature to structure administrative institutions as the times\ndemand, so long as the President retains the ability to carry out\nhis constitutional duties. And most relevant here, they give\nCongress wide leeway to limit the President\u2019s removal power in the\ninterest of enhancing independence from politics in regulatory\nbodies like the CFPB.AWhat does the Constitution say about the\nseparation of powers\u2014and particularly about the President\u2019s removal\nauthority? (Spoiler alert: about the latter, nothing at all.)The majority offers the civics class version of\nseparation of powers\u2014call it the Schoolhouse Rock definition of the\nphrase. See Schoolhouse Rock! Three Ring Government (Mar. 13,\n1979), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= pKSGyiT-o3o (\u201cRing one,\nExecutive. Two is Legislative, that\u2019s Congress. Ring three,\nJudiciary\u201d). The Constitution\u2019s first three articles, the majority\nrecounts, \u201csplit the atom of sovereignty\u201d among Congress, the\nPresident, and the courts.Ante,at 21 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And by that mechanism, the Framers provided a\n\u201csimple\u201d fix \u201cto governmental power and its perils.\u201dIbid.There is nothing wrong with that as a beginning\n(except the adjective \u201csimple\u201d). It is of course true that the\nFramers lodged three different kinds of power in three different\nentities. And that they did so for a crucial purpose\u2014because, as\nJames Madison wrote, \u201cthere can be no liberty where the legislative\nand executive powers are united in the same person[\u00a0] or body\u201d\nor where \u201cthe power of judging [is] not separated from the\nlegislative and executive powers.\u201d The Federalist No. 47, p. 325\n(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (quoting Baron de Montesquieu).The problem lies in treating the beginning as an\nending too\u2014in failing to recognize that the separation of powers\nis, by design, neither rigid nor complete. Blackstone, whose work\ninfluenced the Framers on this subject as on others, observed that\n\u201cevery branch\u201d of government \u201csupports and is supported, regulates\nand is regulated, by the rest.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 151 (1765). So as James Madison stated, the\ncreation of distinct branches \u201cdid not mean that these departments\nought to have no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of\neach other.\u201d The Federalist No. 47,at 325 (emphasis\ndeleted).[2] To the contrary,\nMadison explained, the drafters of the Constitution\u2014like those of\nthen-existing state constitutions\u2014opted against keeping the\nbranches of government \u201cabsolutely separate and distinct.\u201dId.,at 327. Or as Justice Story reiterated a half-century\nlater: \u201c[W]hen we speak of a separation of the three great\ndepartments of government,\u201d it is \u201cnot meant to affirm, that they\nmust be kept wholly and entirely separate.\u201d 2 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7524, p. 8\n(1833). Instead, the branches have\u2014as they must for the whole\narrangement to work\u2014\u201ccommon link[s] of connexion [and] dependence.\u201dIbid.One way the Constitution reflects that vision is\nby giving Congress broad authority to establish and organize the\nExecutive Branch. Article II presumes the existence of \u201cOfficer[s]\u201d\nin \u201cexecutive Departments.\u201d \u00a72, cl. 1. But it does not, as you\nmight think from reading the majority opinion, give the President\nauthority to decide what kinds of officers\u2014in what departments,\nwith what responsibilities\u2014the Executive Branch requires. Seeante,at 11 (\u201cThe entire \u2018executive Power\u2019 belongs to the\nPresident alone\u201d). Instead, Article I\u2019s Necessary and Proper Clause\nputs those decisions in the legislature\u2019s hands. Congress has the\npower \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for\ncarrying into Execution\u201d not just its own enumerated powers but\nalso \u201call other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer\nthereof.\u201d \u00a78, cl. 18. Similarly, the Appointments Clause reflects\nCongress\u2019s central role in structuring the Executive Branch. Yes,\nthe President can appoint principal officers, but only as the\nlegislature \u201cshall .\u00a0.\u00a0. establish[\u00a0] by Law\u201d (and\nof course subject to the Senate\u2019s advice and consent). Art. II, \u00a72,\ncl. 2. And Congress has plenary power to decide not only what\ninferior officers will exist but also who (the President or a head\nof department) will appoint them. So as Madison told the first\nCongress, the legislature gets to \u201ccreate[\u00a0] the office,\ndefine[\u00a0] the powers, [and] limit[\u00a0] its duration.\u201d 1\nAnnals of Cong. 582 (1789). The President, as to the construction\nof his own branch of government, can only try to work his will\nthrough the legislative process.[3]The majority relies for its contrary vision on\nArticle II\u2019s Vesting Clause, seeante,at 11\u201312, 25, but the\nprovision can\u2019t carry all that weight. Or as Chief Justice\nRehnquist wrote of a similar claim inMorrisonv.Olson,487 U.S.\n654(1988), \u201cextrapolat[ing]\u201d an unrestricted removal power\nfrom such \u201cgeneral constitutional language\u201d\u2014which says only that\n\u201c[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President\u201d\u2014is \u201cmore\nthan the text will bear.\u201dId.,at 690, n. 29. Dean John\nManning has well explained why, even were it not obvious from the\nClause\u2019s \u201copen-ended language.\u201d Separation of Powers as Ordinary\nInterpretation, 124 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1939, 1971 (2011). The\nNecessary and Proper Clause, he writes, makes it impossible to\n\u201cestablish a constitutional violation simply by showing that\nCongress has constrained the way \u2018[t]he executive Power\u2019 is\nimplemented\u201d; that is exactly what the Clause gives Congress the\npower to do.Id.,at 1967. Only \u201caspecifichistorical understanding\u201d can bar Congress from enacting a given\nconstraint.Id.,at 2024. And nothing of that sort broadly\nprevents Congress from limiting the President\u2019s removal power. I\u2019ll\nturn soon to the Decision of 1789 and other evidence of\nPost-Convention thought. Seeinfra, at 9\u201313. For now, note\ntwo points about practice before the Constitution\u2019s drafting.\nFirst, in that era, Parliament often restricted the King\u2019s power to\nremove royal officers\u2014and the President, needless to say, wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to be a king. See Birk, Interrogating the Historical Basis\nfor a Unitary Executive, 73 Stan. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2021).\nSecond, many States at the time allowed limits on gubernatorial\nremoval power even though their constitutions had similar vesting\nclauses. See Shane, The Originalist Myth of the Unitary Executive,\n19 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 323, 334\u2013344 (2016). Historical\nunderstandings thus belie the majority\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule.\u201dNor can the Take Care Clause come to the\nmajority\u2019s rescue. That Clause cannot properly serve as a\n\u201cplaceholder for broad judicial judgments\u201d about presidential\ncontrol. Goldsmith & Manning, The Protean Take Care Clause, 164\nU. Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 1835, 1867 (2016); but seeante,at\n11\u201312, 27\u201328, n.\u00a011 (using it that way). To begin with, the\nprovision\u2014\u201che shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted\u201d\u2014speaks of duty, not power. Art.\u00a0II, \u00a73. New\nscholarship suggests the language came from English and colonial\noaths taken by, and placing fiduciary obligations on, all manner\nand rank of executive officers. See Kent, Leib, & Shugerman,\nFaithful Execution and Article II, 132 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2111,\n2121\u20132178 (2019). To be sure, the imposition of a duty may imply a\ngrant of power sufficient to carry it out. But again, the\nmajority\u2019s view of that power ill comports with founding-era\npractice, in which removal limits were common. See,e.g.,Corwin, Tenure of Office and the Removal Power Under the\nConstitution, 27 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 353, 385 (1927) (noting that\nNew York\u2019s Constitution of 1777 had nearly the same clause, though\nthe State\u2019s executive had \u201cvery little voice\u201d in removals). And yet\nmore important, the text of the Take Care Clause requires only\nenough authority to make sure \u201cthe laws [are] faithfully\nexecuted\u201d\u2014meaning with fidelity to the law itself, not to every\npresidential policy preference. As this Court has held, a President\ncan ensure \u201c\u00a0\u2018faithful execution\u2019 of the laws\u201d\u2014thereby\nsatisfying his \u201ctake care\u201d obligation\u2014with a removal provision like\nthe one here.Morrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 692. A for-cause\nstandard gives him \u201cample authority to assure that [an official] is\ncompetently performing [his] statutory responsibilities in a manner\nthat comports with the [relevant legislation\u2019s] provisions.\u201dIbid.Finally, recall the Constitution\u2019s telltale\nsilence: Nowhere does the text say anything about the President\u2019s\npower to remove subordinate officials at will. The majority\nprofesses unconcern. After all, it says, \u201cneither is there a\n\u2018separation of powers clause\u2019 or a \u2018federalism clause.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte,at 25. But those concepts are carved into the\nConstitution\u2019s text\u2014the former in its first three articles\nseparating powers, the latter in its enumeration of federal powers\nand its reservation of all else to the States. And anyway, at-will\nremoval is hardly such a \u201cfoundational doctrine[\u00a0],\u201dibid.: You won\u2019t find it on a civics class syllabus. That\u2019s\nbecause removal is atool\u2014one means among many, even if\nsometimes an important one, for a President to control executive\nofficials. See generallyFree Enterprise Fund,561\nU.\u00a0S., at 524 (Breyer, J., dissenting). To find that authority\nhidden in the Constitution as a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d is to discover what\nis nowhere there.BHistory no better serves the majority\u2019s cause.\nAs Madison wrote, \u201ca regular course of practice\u201d can \u201cliquidate\n& settle the meaning of\u00a0\u201d disputed or indeterminate\nconstitutional provisions. Letter to Spencer Roane (Sept. 2, 1819),\nin 8 Writings of James Madison 450 (G. Hunt ed. 1908); seeNLRBv.Noel Canning,573 U.S.\n513, 525 (2014). The majority lays claim to that kind of\nrecord, asserting that its muscular view of \u201c[t]he President\u2019s\nremoval power has long been confirmed by history.\u201dAnte, at\n12. But that is not so. The early history\u2014including the fabled\nDecision of 1789\u2014shows mostly debate and division about removal\nauthority. And when a \u201csettle[ment of] meaning\u201d at last occurred,\nit was not on the majority\u2019s terms. Instead, it supports wide\nlatitude for Congress to create spheres of administrative\nindependence.1Begin with evidence from the Constitution\u2019s\nratification. And note that this moment is indeed the beginning:\nDelegates to the Constitutional Convention never discussed whether\nor to what extent the President would have power to remove\nexecutive officials. As a result, the Framers advocating\nratification had no single view of the matter. In Federalist No.\n77, Hamilton presumed that under the new Constitution \u201c[t]he\nconsent of [the Senate] would be necessary to displace as well as\nto appoint\u201d officers of the United States.Id.,at 515. He\nthought that scheme would promote \u201csteady administration\u201d: \u201cWhere a\nman in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness\nfor it, a new president would be restrained\u201d from substituting \u201ca\nperson more agreeable to him.\u201dIbid.By contrast, Madison\nthought the Constitution allowed Congress to decide how any\nexecutive official could be removed. He explained in Federalist No.\n39: \u201cThe tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a\nsubject of legal regulation, conformably to the reason of the case,\nand the example of the State Constitutions.\u201dId.,at 253.\nNeither view, of course, at all supports the majority\u2019s\nstory.[4]The second chapter is the Decision of 1789, when\nCongress addressed the removal power while considering the bill\ncreating the Department of Foreign Affairs. Speaking through Chief\nJustice Taft\u2014a judicial presidentialist if ever there was one\u2014this\nCourt inMyersv.United States,272 U.S.\n52(1926), read that debate as expressing Congress\u2019s judgment\nthat the Constitution gave the President illimitable power to\nremove executive officials. The majority rests its own historical\nclaim on that analysis (though somehow also finding room for its\ntwo exceptions). Seeante,at 12\u201313. But Taft\u2019s historical\nresearch has held up even worse thanMyers\u2019 holding (which\nwas mostly reversed, seeinfra, at 17\u201318). As Dean Manning\nhas concluded after reviewing decades\u2019 worth of scholarship on the\nissue, \u201cthe implications of the debate, properly understood, [are]\nhighly ambiguous and prone to overreading.\u201d Manning, 124 Harv.\nL.\u00a0Rev., at 1965, n. 135; seeid.,at 2030\u20132031.The best view is that the First Congress was\n\u201cdeeply divided\u201d on the President\u2019s removal power, and \u201cnever\nsquarely addressed\u201d the central issue here.Id.,at 1965, n.\n135; Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91 Cornell L. Rev.\n1021, 1072 (2006). The congressional debates revealed three main\npositions. See Corwin, 27 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev., at 361. Some shared\nHamilton\u2019s Federalist No. 77 view: The Constitution required Senate\nconsent for removal. At the opposite extreme, others claimed that\nthe Constitution gave absolute removal power to the President. And\na third faction maintained that the Constitution placed Congress in\nthe driver\u2019s seat: The legislature could regulate, if it so chose,\nthe President\u2019s authority to remove. In the end, Congress passed a\nbill saying nothing about removal, leaving the President free to\nfire the Secretary of Foreign Affairs at will. But the only one of\nthe three views definitively rejected was Hamilton\u2019s theory of\nnecessary Senate consent. As even strong proponents of executive\npower have shown, Congress never \u201cendorse[d] the view that [it]\nlacked authority to modify\u201d the President\u2019s removal authority when\nit wished to. Prakash,supra,at 1073; see Manning,supra,at 1965, n. 135, 2030\u20132031. The summer of 1789 thus\nended without resolution of the critical question: Was the removal\npower \u201cbeyond the reach of congressional regulation?\u201d Prakash,supra,at 1072.At the same time, the First Congress gave\nofficials han- dling financial affairs\u2014as compared to diplomatic\nand military ones\u2014some independence from the President. The title\nand first section of the statutes creating the Departments of\nForeign Affairs and War designated them \u201cexecutive departments.\u201d\nAct of July 27, 1789, ch. 4, 1Stat. 28; Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 7,\n1Stat. 49. The law creating the Treasury Department conspicuously\navoided doing so. See Act of Sept. 2, 1789, ch. 12, 1Stat. 65. That\ndifference in nomenclature signaled others of substance. Congress\nleft the organization of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and War\nskeletal, enabling the President to decide how he wanted to staff\nthem. See Casper, An Essay in Separation of Powers, 30 Wm. &\nMary L.\u00a0Rev. 211, 239\u2013241 (1989). By contrast, Congress listed\neach of the offices within the Treasury Department, along with\ntheir functions. Seeibid.Of the three initial Secretaries,\nonly the Treasury\u2019s had an obligation to report to Congress when\nrequested. See \u00a72, 1Stat. 65\u201366. And perhaps most notable, Congress\nsoon deemed the Comptroller of the Treasury\u2019s settlements of public\naccounts \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1795, ch. 48, \u00a74,\n1Stat. 441\u2013442. That decision, preventing presidential overrides,\nmarked the Comptroller as exercising independent judgment.[5] True enough, no statute shielded the\nComptroller from discharge. But even James Madison, who at this\npoint opposed most removal limits, told Congress that \u201cthere may be\nstrong reasons why an officer of this kind should not hold his\noffice at the pleasure\u201d of the Secretary or President. 1 Annals of\nCong. 612. At the least, as Professor Prakash writes, \u201cMadison\nmaintained that Congress had the [constitutional] authority to\nmodify [the Comptroller\u2019s] tenure.\u201d Prakash,supra, at\n1071.Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, then, the\nfounding era closed without any agreement that Congress lacked the\npower to curb the President\u2019s removal authority. And as it kept\nthat question open, Congress took the first steps\u2014which would\nlaunch a tradition\u2014of distinguishing financial regulators from\ndiplomatic and military officers. The latter mainly helped the\nPresident carry out his own constitutional duties in foreign\nrelations and war. The former chiefly carried out statutory duties,\nfulfilling functions Congress had assigned to their offices. In\naddressing the new Nation\u2019s finances, Congress had begun to use its\npowers under the Necessary and Proper Clause to design effective\nadministrative institutions. And that included taking steps to\ninsulate certain officers from political influence.2As the decades and centuries passed, those\nefforts picked up steam. Confronting new economic, technological,\nand social conditions, Congress\u2014and often the President\u2014saw new\nneeds for pockets of independence within the federal bureaucracy.\nAnd that was especially so, again, when it came to financial\nregulation. I mention just a few highlights here\u2014times when\nCongress decided that effective governance depended on shielding\ntechnical or expertise-based functions relating to the financial\nsystem from political pressure (or the moneyed interests that might\nlie behind it). Enacted under the Necessary and Proper Clause,\nthose measures\u2014creating some of the Nation\u2019s most enduring\ninstitutions\u2014themselves helped settle the extent of Congress\u2019s\npower. \u201c[A] regular course of practice,\u201d to use Madison\u2019s phrase,\nhas \u201cliquidate[d]\u201d constitutional meaning about the permissibility\nof independent agencies. Seesupra,at 9.Take first Congress\u2019s decision in 1816 to create\nthe Second Bank of the United States\u2014\u201cthe first truly independent\nagency in the republic\u2019s history.\u201d Lessig & Sunstein, The\nPresident and the Administration, 94 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 30\n(1994). Of the twenty-five directors who led the Bank, the\nPresident could appoint and remove only five. See Act of Apr. 10,\n1816, \u00a78, 3Stat. 269. Yet the Bank had a greater impact on the\nNation than any but a few institutions, regulating the Nation\u2019s\nmoney supply in ways anticipating what the Federal Reserve does\ntoday. Of course, the Bank was controversial\u2014in large part because\nof its freedom from presidential control. Andrew Jackson chafed at\nthe Bank\u2019s independence and eventually fired his Treasury Secretary\nfor keeping public moneys there (a dismissal that itself provoked a\npolitical storm). No matter. Innovations in governance always have\nopponents; administrative independence predictably (though by no\nmeans invariably) provokes presidential ire. The point is that by\nthe early 19th century, Congress established a body wielding\nenormous financial power mostly outside the President\u2019s\ndominion.The Civil War brought yet further encroachments\non presidential control over financial regulators. In response to\nwartime economic pressures, President Lincoln (not known for his\nmodest view of executive power) asked Congress to establish an\noffice called the Comptroller of the Currency. The statute he\nsigned made the Comptroller removable only with the Senate\u2019s\nconsent\u2014a version of the old Hamiltonian idea, though this time\nrequired not by the Constitution itself but by Congress. See Act of\nFeb. 25, 1863, ch. 58, 12Stat. 665. A year later, Congress amended\nthe statute to permit removal by the President alone, but only upon\n\u201creasons to be communicated by him to the Senate.\u201d Act of June 3,\n1864, \u00a71, 13Stat. 100. The majority dismisses the original version\nof the statute as an \u201caberration.\u201dAnte,at 19. But in the\nwake of the independence given first to the Comptroller of the\nTreasury and then to the national Bank, it\u2019s hard to conceive of\nthis newest Comptroller position as so great a departure. And even\nthe second iteration of the statute preserved a constraint on the\nremoval power, requiring a President in a firing mood to explain\nhimself to Congress\u2014a demand likely to make him sleep on the\nsubject. In both versions of the law, Congress responded to new\nfinancial challenges with new regulatory institutions, alert to the\nperils in this area of political interference.[6]And then, nearly a century and a half ago, the\nfloodgates opened. In 1887, the growing power of the railroads over\nthe American economy led Congress to create the InterstateCommerce Commission. Under that legislation, the\nPresi- dent could remove the five Commissioners only \u201cfor\ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d\u2014the same\nstandard Congress applied to the CFPB Director. Act of Feb. 4,\n1887, \u00a711, 24Stat. 383. More\u2014many more\u2014for-cause removal provisions\nfollowed. In 1913, Congress gave the Governors of the Federal\nReserve Board for-cause protection to ensure the agency would\nresist political pressure and promote economic stability. See Act\nof Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, 38Stat. 251. The next year, Congress\nprovided similar protection to the FTC in the interest of ensuring\n\u201ca continuous policy\u201d \u201cfree from the effect\u201d of \u201cchanging [White\nHouse] incumbency.\u201d 51 Cong. Rec. 10376 (1914). The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the\nfinancial realm, \u201cindependent agencies have remained the bedrock of\nthe institutional framework governing U. S. markets.\u201d Gadinis, From\nIndependence to Politics in Financial Regulation, 101 Cal.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 327, 331 (2013). By one count, across all subject\nmatter areas, 48 agencies have heads (and below them hundreds more\ninferior officials) removable only for cause. SeeFree\nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 541 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). So year by year by year, the broad sweep of history\nhas spoken to the constitutional question before us: Independent\nagencies are everywhere.CWhat is more, the Court\u2019s precedents before\ntoday have accepted the role of independent agencies in our\ngovernmental system. To be sure, the line of our decisions has not\nrun altogether straight. But we have repeatedly upheld provisions\nthat prevent the President from firing regulatory officials except\nfor such matters as neglect or malfeasance. In those decisions, we\nsounded a caution, insisting that Congress could not impede through\nremoval restrictions the President\u2019s performance of his own\nconstitutional duties. (So, to take the clearest example, Congress\ncould not curb the President\u2019s power to remove his close military\nor diplomatic advisers.) But within that broad limit, this Court\nheld, Congress could protect from at-will removal the officials it\ndeemed to need some independence from political pressures. Nowhere\ndo those precedents suggest what the majority announces today: that\nthe President has an \u201cunrestricted removal power\u201d subject to two\nbounded exceptions.Ante, at 2.The majority grounds its new approach inMyers, ignoring the way this Court has cabined that\ndecision.Myers, the majority tells us, found an\nunrestrained removal power \u201cessential to the [President\u2019s]\nexecution of the laws.\u201dAnte,at 13 (quotingMyers,272 U.\u00a0S., at 117). What the majority does not say is that\nwithin a decade the Court abandoned that view (much as later\nscholars rejected Taft\u2019s one-sided history, seesupra,at\n10\u201311). InHumphrey\u2019s Executorv.United States,295 U.S.\n602(1935), the Court unceremoniously\u2014and unanimously\u2014confinedMyersto its facts. \u201c[T]he narrow point actually decided\u201d\nthere,Humphrey\u2019sstated, was that the President could\n\u201cremove a postmaster of the first class, without the advice and\nconsent of the Senate.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S.,at 626. Nothing else\nin Chief Justice Taft\u2019s prolix opinion \u201cc[a]me within the rule ofstare decisis.\u201dIbid.(Indeed, the Court went on,\neverything inMyers\u201cout of harmony\u201d withHumphrey\u2019swas expressly \u201cdisapproved.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S., at 626.) Half a\ncentury later, the Court was more generous. Two decisions readMyersas standing for the principle that Congress\u2019s own\n\u201cparticipation in the removal of executive officers is\nunconstitutional.\u201dBowsherv.Synar,478 U.S.\n714, 725 (1986); seeMorrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 686\n(\u201cAs we observed inBowsher, the essence\u201d of \u201cMyerswas the judgment that the Constitution prevents Congress from\ndraw[ing] to itself\u00a0\u201d the power to remove (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).Bowshermade clear thatMyershad\nnothing to say about Congress\u2019s power to enact a provision merely\n\u201climit[ing] the President\u2019s powers of removal\u201d through a for-cause\nprovision. 478 U.\u00a0S., at 724. That issue, the Court stated,\nwas \u201cnot presented\u201d in \u201ctheMyerscase.\u201dIbid.Instead, the relevant cite wasHumphrey\u2019s.AndHumphrey\u2019sfound constitutional a\nstatute identical to the one here, providing that the President\ncould remove FTC Commissioners for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty,\nor malfeasance in office.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S., at 619. TheHumphrey\u2019sCourt, as the majority notes, relied in\nsubstantial part on what kind of work the Commissioners performed.\nSeeid.,at 628, 631;ante,at 14. (By contrast,\nnothing in the decision turned\u2014as the majority suggests, seeante,at 14\u201315\u2014on any of the agency\u2019s organizational\nfeatures. Seeinfra, at 30.) According toHumphrey\u2019s,\nthe Commissioners\u2019 primary work was to \u201ccarry into effect\nlegislative policies\u201d\u2014\u201cfilling in and administering the details\nembodied by [a statute\u2019s] general standard.\u201d 295 U.\u00a0S., at\n627\u2013628. In addition, the Court noted, the Commissioners\nrecommended dispositions in court cases, much as a special master\ndoes. Given those \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d\u2014as\nopposed to \u201cpurely executive\u201d\u2014functions, Congress could limit the\nPresident\u2019s removal authority.Id.,at 628.[7] Or said another way, Congress could give\nthe FTC some \u201cindependen[ce from] executive control.\u201dId.,at 629.About two decades later, an again-unanimous\nCourt inWienerv.United States,357 U.S.\n349(1958), reaffirmedHumphrey\u2019s. The question inWienerwas whether the President could dismiss without cause\nmembers of the War Claims Commission, an entity charged with\ncompensating injuries arising from World War II. DisdainingMyersand relying onHumphrey\u2019s, the Court said he\ncould not. The Court described as \u201cshort-lived\u201dMyers\u2019 view\nthat the President had \u201cinherent constitutional power to remove\nofficials, no matter what the relation of the executive to the\ndischarge of their duties.\u201d 357 U.\u00a0S.,at 352.[8] Here, the Commissioners were not\nclose agents of the President, who needed to be responsive to his\npreferences. Rather, they exercised adjudicatory responsibilities\nover legal claims. Congress, the Court found, had wanted the\nCommissioners to do so \u201cfree from [political] control or coercive\ninfluence.\u201dId.,at 355 (quotingHumphrey\u2019s, 295\nU.\u00a0S., at 629). And that choice, asHumphrey\u2019shad\nheld, was within Congress\u2019s power. The Constitution enabled\nCongress to take down \u201cthe Damocles\u2019 sword of removal\u201d hanging over\nthe Commissioners\u2019 heads. 357 U.\u00a0S., at 356.Another three decades on,Morrisonboth\nextendedHumphrey\u2019sdomain and clarified the standard for\naddressing removal issues. TheMorrisonCourt, over a\none-Justice dissent, upheld for-cause protections afforded to an\nindependent counsel with power to investigate and prosecute crimes\ncommitted by high-ranking officials. The Court well understood that\nthose law enforcement functions differed from the rulemaking and\nadjudicatory duties highlighted inHumphrey\u2019sandWiener. But that difference did not resolve the issue. An\nofficial\u2019s functions,Morrisonheld, were relevant to but\nnot dispositive of a removal limit\u2019s constitutionality. The key\nquestion in all the cases,Morrisonsaw, was whether such a\nrestriction would \u201cimpede the President\u2019s ability to perform his\nconstitutional duty.\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S., at 691. Only if it did so\nwould it fall outside Congress\u2019s power. And the protection for the\nindependent counsel, the Court found, did not. Even though the\ncounsel\u2019s functions were \u201cpurely executive,\u201d the President\u2019s \u201cneed\nto control the exercise of [her] discretion\u201d was not \u201cso central to\nthe functioning of the Executive Branch as to require\u201d unrestricted\nremoval authority.Id.,at 690\u2013691. True enough, the Court\nacknowledged, that the for-cause standard prevented the President\nfrom firing the counsel for discretionary decisions or judgment\ncalls. But it preserved \u201cample authority\u201d in the President \u201cto\nassure that the counsel is competently performing\u201d her\n\u201cresponsibilities in a manner that comports with\u201d all legal\nrequirements.Id.,at 692. That meant the President could\nmeet his own constitutional obligation \u201cto ensure \u2018the faithful\nexecution\u2019 of the laws.\u201dIbid.; seesupra,at\n8.[9]The majority\u2019s description ofMorrison,\nseeante,at 15\u201316, is not true to the decision. (Mostly, it\nseems, the majority just wishes the case would go away. Seeante,at 17, n.\u00a04.) First,Morrisonis no\n\u201cexception\u201d to a broader rule fromMyers.Morrisonechoed all ofHumphrey\u2019scriticism of the by-then infamousMyers\u201cdicta.\u201d 487 U.\u00a0S.,at 687. It again\nrejected the notion of an \u201call-inclusive\u201d removal power.Ibid.It yet further confinedMyers\u2019 reach, making\nclear that Congress could restrict the President\u2019s removal of\nofficials carrying out even the most traditional executive\nfunctions. And the decision, with care, set out the governing\nrule\u2014again, that removal restrictions are permissible so long as\nthey do not impede the President\u2019s performance of his own\nconstitutionally assigned duties. Second, as all that suggests,Morrisonis not limited to inferior officers. In the eight\npages addressing the removal issue, the Court constantly spoke of\n\u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cofficials\u201d in general. 487 U.\u00a0S., at 685\u2013693.\nBy contrast, the Court there used the word \u201cinferior\u201d in just one\nsentence (which of course the majority quotes), when applying its\ngeneral standard to the case\u2019s facts.Id.,at 691. Indeed,\nJustice Scalia\u2019s dissent emphasized that the counsel\u2019s\ninferior-office status played no role in the Court\u2019s decision. Seeid.,at 724 (\u201cThe Court could have resolved the removal\npower issue in this case by simply relying\u201d on that status, but did\nnot). As Justice Scalia noted, the Court inUnited Statesv.Perkins,116 U.S.\n483, 484\u2013485 (1886), had a century earlier allowed Congress to\nrestrict the President\u2019s removal power over inferior officers. SeeMorrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 723\u2013724. Were thatMorrison\u2019s basis, a simple citation would have sufficed.EvenFree Enterprise Fund, in which the\nCourt recently held a removal provision invalid, operated within\nthe framework of this precedent\u2014and in so doing, left in place a\nremoval provision just like the one here. In that case, the Court\nconsidered a \u201chighly unusual\u201d scheme of double for-cause\nprotection. 561 U.\u00a0S., at 505. Members of an accounting board\nwere protected from removal by SEC Commissioners, who in turn were\nprotected from removal by the President. The Court found that the\ntwo-layer structure deprived the President of \u201cadequate control\u201d\nover the Board members.Id.,at 508. The scheme \u201cimpaired\u201d\nthe President\u2019s \u201cability to execute the laws,\u201d the Court explained,\nbecause neither he nor any fully dependent agent could decide\n\u201cwhether[\u00a0] good cause exists\u201d for a discharge.Id.,at\n495\u2013496. That holding cast no doubt on ordinary for-cause\nprotections, of the kind in the Court\u2019s prior cases (and here as\nwell). Quite the opposite. The Court observed that it did not \u201ctake\nissue with for-cause limitations in general\u201d\u2014whichdoenable\nthe President to determine whether good cause for discharge exists\n(because, say, an official has violated the law).Id.,at\n501. And the Court\u2019s solution to the constitutional problem it saw\nwas merely to strike one level of insulation, making the Board\nremovable by the SEC at will. That remedy left the SEC\u2019s own\nfor-cause protection in place. The President could thus remove\nCommissioners for malfeasance or neglect, but not for policy\ndisagreements. Seeante,at 28.So caselaw joins text and history in\nestablishing the general permissibility of for-cause provisions\ngiving some independence to agencies. Contrary to the majority\u2019s\nview, those laws do not represent a suspicious departure from\nillimitable presidential control over administration. For almost a\ncentury, this Court has made clear that Congress has broad\ndiscretion to enact for-cause protections in pursuit of good\ngovernance.DThe deferential approach this Court has taken\ngives Con-gress the flexibility it needs to craft\nadministrative agencies. Diverse problems of government demand\ndiverse solutions. They call for varied measures and mixtures of\ndemocratic accountability and technical expertise, energy and\nefficiency. Sometimes, the arguments push toward tight presidential\ncontrol of agencies. The President\u2019s engagement, some people say,\ncan disrupt bureaucratic stagnation, counter industry capture, and\nmake agencies more responsive to public interests. See, well,\nKagan, Presidential Administration, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 2245,\n2331\u20132346 (2001). At other times, the arguments favor greater\nindependence from presidential involvement. Insulation from\npolitical pressure helps ensure impartial adjudications. It places\ntechnical issues in the hands of those most capable of addressing\nthem. It promotes continuity, and prevents short-term electoral\ninterests from distorting policy. (Consider, for example, how the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s independence stops a President trying to win a\nsecond term from manipulating interest rates.) Of course, the right\nbalance between presidential control and independence is often\nuncertain, contested, and value-laden. No mathematical formula\ngoverns institutional design; trade-offs are endemic to the\nenterprise. But that is precisely why the issue is one for the\npolitical branches to debate\u2014and then debate again as times change.\nAnd it\u2019s why courts should stay (mostly) out of the way. Rather\nthan impose rigid rules like the majority\u2019s, they should let\nCongress and the President figure out what blend of independence\nand political control will best enable an agency to perform its\nintended functions.Judicial intrusion into this field usually\nreveals only how little courts know about governance. Even\neverything I just said is an over-simplification. It suggests that\nagencies can easily be arranged on a spectrum, from the most to the\nleast presidentially controlled. But that is not so. A given\nagency\u2019s independence (or lack of it) depends on a wealth of\nfeatures, relating not just to removal standards, but also to\nappointments practices, procedural rules, internal organization,\noversight regimes, historical traditions, cultural norms, and\n(inevitably) personal relationships. It is hard to pinpoint how\nthose factors work individually, much less in concert, to influence\nthe distance between an agency and a President. In that light, even\nthe judicial opinions\u2019 perennial focus on removal standards is a\nbit of a puzzle. Removal is only the most obvious, not necessarily\nthe most potent, means of control. See generallyFree Enterprise\nFund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 524 (Breyer, J., dissenting). That is\nbecause informal restraints can prevent Presidents from firing\nat-will officers\u2014and because other devices can keep officers with\nfor-cause protection under control. Of course no court, asFree\nEnterprise Fundnoted, can accurately assess the \u201cbureaucratic\nminutiae\u201d affecting a President\u2019s influence over an agency.Id., at 500 (majority opinion);ante,at 30\n(reprising the point). But that is yet more reason for courts to\ndefer to the branches charged with fashioning administrative\nstructures, and to hesitate before ruling out agency design specs\nlike for-cause removal standards.Our Constitution, as shown earlier, entrusts\nsuch decisions to more accountable and knowledgeable actors. Seesupra,at 4\u20139. The document\u2014with great good sense\u2014sets out\nalmost no rules about the administrative sphere. As Chief Justice\nMarshall wrote when he upheld the first independent financial\nagency: \u201cTo have prescribed the means by which government should,\nin all future time, execute its powers, would have been to change,\nentirely, the character of the instrument.\u201dMcCulloch, 4\nWheat., at 415. That would have been, he continued, \u201can unwise\nattempt to provide, by immutable rules, for exigencies which, if\nforeseen at all, must have been seen dimly.\u201dIbid.And if\nthe Constitution, for those reasons, does not lay out immutable\nrules, then neither should judges. This Court has usually respected\nthat injunction. It has declined to second-guess the work of the\npolitical branches in creating independent agencies like the CFPB.\nIn reversing course today\u2014in spurning a \u201cpragmatic, flexible\napproach to American governance\u201d in favor of a dogmatic, inflexible\none,ante,at 29\u2014the majority makes a serious error.IIAs the majority explains, the CFPB emerged out\nof disaster. The collapse of the subprime mortgage market\n\u201cprecipitat[ed] a financial crisis that wiped out over $10 trillion\nin American household wealth and cost millions of Americans their\njobs, their retirements, and their homes.\u201dAnte,at 3. In\nthat moment of economic ruin, the President proposed and Congress\nenacted legislation to address the causes of the collapse and\nprevent a recurrence. An important part of that statute created an\nagency to protect consumers from exploitative financial practices.\nThe agency would take over enforcement of almost 20 existing\nfederal laws. See 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75581. And it would\nadminister a new prohibition on \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\nact[s] or practice[s]\u201d in the consumer-finance sector.\n\u00a75536(a)(1)(B).No one had a doubt that the new agency should be\nindependent. As explained already, Congress has historically\ngiven\u2014with this Court\u2019s permission\u2014a measure of independence to\nfinancial regulators like the Federal Reserve Board and the FTC.\nSeesupra,at 11\u201316. And agencies of that kind had\nadministered most of the legislation whose enforcement the new\nstatute transferred to the CFPB. The law thus included an ordinary\nfor-cause provision\u2014once again, that the President could fire the\nCFPB\u2019s Director only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance in office.\u201d \u00a75491(c)(3). That standard would allow the\nPresident to discharge the Director for a failure to \u201cfaithfully\nexecute[\u00a0]\u201d the law, as well as for basic incompetence.\nU.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0II, \u00a73; seesupra,at 8, 20.\nBut it would not permit removal for policy differences.The question here, which by now you\u2019re well\nequipped to answer, is whether including that for-cause standard in\nthe statute creating the CFPB violates the Constitution.AApplying our longstanding precedent, the\nanswer is clear: It does not. This Court, as the majority\nacknowledges, has sustained the constitutionality of the FTC and\nsimilar independent agencies. Seeante,at 2, 13\u201316. The\nfor-cause protections for the heads of those agencies, the Court\nhas found, do not impede the President\u2019s ability to perform his own\nconstitutional duties, and so do not breach the separation of\npowers. Seesupra,at 18\u201322. There is nothing different\nhere. The CFPB wields the same kind of power as the FTC and similar\nagencies. And all of their heads receive the same kind of removal\nprotection. No less than those other entities\u2014by now part of the\nfabric of government\u2014the CFPB is thus a permissible exercise of\nCongress\u2019s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to structure\nadministration.First, the CFPB\u2019s powers are nothing unusual in\nthe universe of independent agencies. The CFPB, as the majority\nnotes, can issue regulations, conduct its own adjudications, and\nbring civil enforcement actions in court\u2014all backed by the threat\nof penalties. Seeante,at 1; 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a75512,\n5562\u20135565. But then again, so too can (among others) the FTC and\nSEC, two agencies whose regulatory missions parallel the CFPB\u2019s.\nSee 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a745, 53, 57a, 57b\u20133, 78u, 78v, 78w. Just\nfor a comparison, the CFPB now has 19 enforcement actions pending,\nwhile the SEC brought 862 such actions last year alone. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 7; SEC, Div. of Enforcement 2019 Ann. Rep.\u00a014.\nAnd although the majority bemoans that the CFPB can \u201cbring the\ncoercive power of the state to bear on millions of private\ncitizens,\u201dante,at 18, that scary-sounding description\napplies to most independent agencies. Forget that the more relevant\nfactoid for those many citizens might be that the CFPB has\nrecovered over $11 billion for banking consumers. Seeante,at 5. The key point here is that the CFPB got the mass of its\nregulatory authority from other independent agencies that had\nbrought the same \u201ccoercive power to bear.\u201d See 12\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75581 (transferring power from, among others,\nthe Federal Reserve, FTC, and FDIC). Congress, to be sure, gave the\nCFPB new authority over \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive act[s] or\npractice[s]\u201d in transactions involving a \u201cconsumer financial\nproduct or service.\u201d \u00a7\u00a75517(a)(1), 5536(a)(1). But again, the FTC\nhas power to go after \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or\naffecting commerce\u201d\u2014a portfolio spanning a far wider swath of the\neconomy. 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a745(a)(1).[10] And if influence on economic life is the measure,\nconsider the Federal Reserve, whose every act has global\nconsequence. The CFPB, gauged by that comparison, is a piker.Second, the removal protection given the CFPB\u2019s\nDirector is standard fare. The removal power rests with the\nPresident alone; Congress has no role to play, as it did in the\nlaws struck down inMyersandBowsher. Seesupra,at 17\u201318. The statute provides only one layer of\nprotection, unlike the law inFree Enterprise Fund. Seesupra,at 21\u201322. And the clincher, which you have heard\nbefore: The for-cause standard used for the CFPB is identical to\nthe one the Court upheld inHumphrey\u2019s. Both enable the\nPresident to fire an agency head for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of\nduty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d See 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a75491(c)(3); 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741;supra,at 18. A\nremoval provision of that kind applied to a financial agency head,\nthis Court has held, does not \u201cunduly trammel[\u00a0] on executive\nauthority,\u201d even though it prevents the President from dismissing\nthe official for a discretionary policy judgment.Morrison,\n487 U.\u00a0S., at 691. Once again: The removal power has not been\n\u201ccompletely stripped from the President,\u201d providing him with no\nmeans to \u201censure the \u2018faithful execution\u2019 of the laws.\u201dId.,at 692; seesupra,at 20. Rather, this Court has explained,\nthe for-cause standard gives the President \u201cample authority to\nassure that [the official] is competently performing his or her\nstatutory responsibilities in a manner that comports with\u201d all\nlegal obligations. 487 U.\u00a0S., at 692; seesupra,at 20.\nIn other words\u2014and contra today\u2019s majority\u2014the President\u2019s removal\npower, though not absolute, gives him the \u201cmeaningful[\u00a0]\ncontrol[\u00a0]\u201d of the Director that the Constitution requires.Ante,at 23.The analysis is as simple as simple can be. The\nCFPB Director exercises the same powers, and receives the same\nremoval protections, as the heads of other, constitutionally\npermissible independent agencies. How could it be that this opinion\nis a dissent?BThe majority focuses on one (it says\nsufficient) reason: The CFPB Director is singular, not plural.\n\u201cInstead of placing the agency under the leadership of a board with\nmultiple members,\u201d the majority protests, \u201cCongress provided that\nthe CFPB would be led by a single Director.\u201dAnte,at\n1.[11] And a solo CFPB\nDirector does not fit within either of the majority\u2019s supposed\nexceptions. He is not an inferior officer, so (the majority says)Morrisondoes not apply; and he is not a multimember board,\nso (the majority says) neither doesHumphrey\u2019s. Further, the\nmajority argues, \u201c[a]n agency with a [unitary] structure like that\nof the CFPB\u201d is \u201cnovel\u201d\u2014or, if not quite that, \u201calmost wholly\nunprecedented.\u201dAnte,at 2, 18. Finally, the CFPB\u2019s\norganizational form violates the \u201cconstitutional structure\u201d because\nit vests power in a \u201csingle individual\u201d who is \u201cinsulated from\nPresidential control.\u201dAnte,at 2\u20133, 23.I\u2019m tempted at this point just to say: No. All\nI\u2019ve explained about constitutional text, history, and precedent\ninvalidates the majority\u2019s thesis. But I\u2019ll set out here some more\ntargeted points, taking step by step the majority\u2019s reasoning.First, as I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve heard before, the\nmajority\u2019s \u201cexceptions\u201d (like its general rule) are made up. Seesupra,at 16\u201322. To begin with, our precedents reject the\nvery idea of such exceptions. \u201cThe analysis contained in our\nremoval cases,\u201dMorrisonstated, shuns any attempt \u201cto\ndefine rigid categories\u201d of officials who may (or may not) have job\nprotection. 487 U.\u00a0S., at 689. Still more, the contours of the\nmajority\u2019s exceptions don\u2019t connect to our decisions\u2019 reasoning.\nThe analysis inMorrison, as I\u2019ve shown, extended far beyond\ninferior officers. Seesupra,at 20\u201321. And of course that\nanalysis had to apply toindividualofficers: The\nindependent counsel was very much a person, not a committee. So the\nidea thatMorrisonis in a separate box from this case\ndoesn\u2019t hold up.[12]\nSimilarly,Humphrey\u2019sand later precedents give no support\nto the majority\u2019s view that the number of people at the apex of an\nagency matters to the constitutional issue. Those opinions mention\nthe \u201cgroupness\u201d of the agency head only in their background\nsections. The majority picks out that until-now-irrelevant fact to\ndistinguish the CFPB, and constructs around it an\nuntil-now-unheard-of exception. So if the majority really wants to\nsee something \u201cnovel,\u201dante,at 2, it need only look to its\nopinion.By contrast, the CFPB\u2019s single-director\nstructure has a fair bit of precedent behind it. The Comptroller of\nthe Currency. The Office of the Special Counsel (OSC). The Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA). The Federal Housing Finance Agency\n(FHFA). Maybe four prior agencies is in the eye of the beholder,\nbut it\u2019s hardly nothing. I\u2019ve already explained why the earliest of\nthose agencies\u2014the Civil-War-era Comptroller\u2014is not the blip the\nmajority describes. Seesupra,at 14\u201315. The office is one\nin a long line, starting with the founding-era Comptroller of the\nTreasury (also one person), of financial regulators designed to do\ntheir jobs with some independence. As for the other three, the\nmajority objects: too powerless and too contested. Seeante,at 18\u201321. I think not. On power, the SSA runs the Nation\u2019s largest\ngovernment program\u2014among other things, deciding all claims brought\nby its 64 million beneficiaries; the FHFA plays a crucial role in\noverseeing the mortgage market, on which millions of Americans\nannually rely; and the OSC prosecutes misconduct in the\ntwo-million-person federal workforce. All different from the CFPB,\nno doubt; but the majority can\u2019t think those matters beneath a\nPresident\u2019s notice. (Consider: Would the President lose more votes\nfrom a malfunctioning SSA or CFPB?) And controversial? Well, yes,\nthey are. Almostallindependent agencies are controversial,\nno matter how many directors they have. Or at least controversial\namong Presidents and their lawyers. That\u2019s because whatever might\nbe said in their favor, those agencies divest the President of some\nremoval power. If signing statements and veto threats made\nindependent agencies unconstitutional, quite a few wouldn\u2019t pass\nmuster. Maybe that\u2019s what the majority really wants (I wouldn\u2019t\nknow)\u2014but it can\u2019t pretend the disputes surrounding these agencies\nhad anything to do with whether their heads are singular or\nplural.Still more important, novelty is not the test of\nconstitutionality when it comes to structuring agencies. SeeMistrettav.United States,488\nU.S. 361, 385 (1989) (\u201c[M]ere anomaly or innovation\u201d does not\nviolate the separation of powers). Congress regulates in that\nsphere under the Necessary and Proper Clause, not (as the majority\nseems to think) a Rinse and Repeat Clause. Seesupra,at 6.\nThe Framers understood that new times would often require new\nmeasures, and exigencies often demand innovation. SeeMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415;supra,at 24. In line\nwith that belief, the history of the administrative sphere\u2014its\nrules, its practices, its institutions\u2014is replete with experiment\nand change. Seesupra,at 9\u201316. Indeed, each of the agencies\nthe majority says now fits within its \u201cexceptions\u201d was once new;\nthere is, as the saying goes, \u201ca first time for everything.\u201dNational Federation of Independent Businessv.Sebelius,567 U.S.\n519, 549 (2012). So even if the CFPB differs from its forebears\nin having a single director, that departure is not itself \u201ctelling\u201d\nof a \u201cconstitutional problem.\u201dAnte,at 18. In deciding whatthismoment demanded, Congress had no obligation to make a\ncarbon copy of a design from a bygone era.And Congress\u2019s choice to put a single director,\nrather than a multimember commission, at the CFPB\u2019s head violates\nno principle of separation of powers. The purported constitutional\nproblem here is that an official has \u201cslip[ped] from the\nExecutive\u2019s control\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d\u2014that he has become\nunaccountable to the President.Ante,at 23, 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). So to make sense on the majority\u2019s own\nterms, the distinction between singular and plural agency heads\nmust rest on a theory about why the former more easily \u201cslip\u201d from\nthe President\u2019s grasp. But the majority has nothing to offer. In\nfact, the opposite is more likely to be true: To the extent that\nsuch matters are measurable, individuals are easier than groups to\nsupervise.To begin with, trying to generalize about these\nmatters is something of a fool\u2019s errand. Presidential control, as\nnoted earlier, can operate through many means\u2014removal to be sure,\nbut also appointments, oversight devices (e.g.,centralized\nreview of rulemaking or litigating positions), budgetary processes,\npersonal outreach, and more. SeeFree Enterprise Fund, 561\nU.\u00a0S., at 524 (Breyer, J., dissenting);supra,at\n23\u201324.[13] The effectiveness\nof each of those control mechanisms, when present, can then depend\non a multitude of agency-specific practices, norms, rules, and\norganizational features. In that complex stew, the difference\nbetween a singular and plural agency head will often make not a\nwhit of difference. Or to make the point more concrete, a\nmultimember commission may be harder to control than an individual\ndirector for a host of reasons unrelated to its plural character.\nThat may be so when the two are subject to the same removal\nstandard, or even when the individual director has greater formal\njob protection. Indeed, the very category of multimember\ncommissions breaks apart under inspection, spoiling the majority\u2019s\nessential dichotomy. See generally Brief for Rachel E. Barkow et\nal. asAmici Curiae. Some of those commissions have chairs\nappointed by the President; others do not. Some of those chairs are\nquite powerful; others are not. Partisan balance requirements, term\nlength, voting rules, and more\u2014all vary widely, in ways that make a\nsignificant difference to the ease of presidential control. Why,\nthen, would anyone distinguish along a simple\ncommission/single-director axis when deciding whether the\nConstitution requires at-will removal?But if the demand is for generalization, then\nthe majority\u2019s distinction cuts the opposite way: More powerful\ncontrol mechanisms are needed (if anything) for commissions.\nHolding everything else equal, those are the agencies more likely\nto \u201cslip from the Executive\u2019s control.\u201dAnte,at 25. Just\nconsider your everyday experience: It\u2019s easier to get one person to\ndo what you want than a gaggle. So too, you know exactly whom to\nblame when an individual\u2014but not when a group\u2014does a job badly. The\nsame is true in bureaucracies. A multimember structure reduces\naccountability to the President because it\u2019s harder for him to\noversee, to influence\u2014or to remove, if necessary\u2014a group of five or\nmore commissioners than a single director. Indeed, that iswhyCongress so often resorts to hydra-headed agencies.\n\u201c[M]ultiple membership,\u201d an influential Senate Report concluded, is\n\u201ca buffer against Presidential control\u201d (especially when combined,\nas it often is, with partisan-balance requirements). Senate\nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, Study on Federal Regulation, S.\nDoc. No. 95\u201391, vol. 5, p. 75 (1977). So, for example, Congress\nconstructed the Federal Reserve as it did because it is \u201ceasier to\nprotect a board from political control than to protect a single\nappointed official.\u201d R. Cushman, The Independent Regulatory\nCommissions 153 (1941).[14]\nIt is hard to know why Congress did not take the same tack when\ncreating the CFPB. But its choice brought the agency only closer to\nthe President\u2014more exposed to his view, more subject to his sway.\nIn short, the majority gets the matter backward: Where presidential\ncontrol is the object, better to have one than many.Because it has no answer on that score, the\nmajority slides to a different question: Assuming presidential\ncontrol of any independent agency is vanishingly slim, is a\nsingle-head or a multi-head agency more capable of exercising\npower, and so of endangering liberty? Seeante,at 21\u201323.\nThe majority says a single head is the greater threat because he\nmay wield power \u201cunilaterally\u201d and \u201c[w]ith no colleagues to\npersuade.\u201dAnte,at 23 (emphasis in original). So the CFPB\nfalls victim to what the majority sees as a constitutional\nanti-power-concentration principle (with an exception for the\nPresident).If you\u2019ve never heard of a statute being struck\ndown on that ground, you\u2019re not alone. It is bad enough to\n\u201cextrapolat[e]\u201d from the \u201cgeneral constitutional language\u201d of\nArticle II\u2019s Vesting Clause an unrestricted removal power\nconstraining Congress\u2019s ability to legislate under the Necessary\nand Proper Clause.Morrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 690, n. 29;\nseesupra,at 7. It is still worse to extrapolate from the\nConstitution\u2019s general structure (division of powers) and implicit\nvalues (liberty) a limit on Congress\u2019s express power to create\nadministrative bodies. And more: to extrapolate from such sources a\ndistinction as prosaic as that between the SEC and the\nCFPB\u2014i.e.,between a multi-headed and single-headed agency.\nThat is, to adapt a phrase (or two) from our precedent, \u201cmore than\u201d\nthe emanations of \u201cthe text will bear.\u201dMorrison, 487\nU.\u00a0S., at 690, n. 29. By using abstract separation-of-powers\narguments for such purposes, the Court \u201cappropriate[s]\u201d the \u201cpower\ndelegated to Congress by the Necessary and Proper Clause\u201d to\ncompose the government. Manning, Foreword: The Means of\nConstitutional Power, 128 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 78 (2014). In\ndeciding for itself what is \u201cproper,\u201d the Court goes beyond its own\nproper bounds.And in doing so, the majority again reveals its\nlack of interest in how agencies work. First, the premise of the\nmajority\u2019s argument\u2014that the CFPB head is a mini-dictator, not\nsubject to meaningful presidential control, seeante, at\n23\u2014is wrong. As this Court has seen in the past, independent\nagencies are not fully independent. A for-cause removal provision,\nas noted earlier, leaves \u201cample\u201d control over agency heads in the\nhands of the President.Morrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 692;\nseesupra, at 20. He can discharge them for failing to\nperform their duties competently or in accordance with law, and so\nensure that the laws are \u201cfaithfully executed.\u201d U. S. Const., Art.\nII, \u00a73; seesupra,at 8, 20. And he can use the many other\ntools attached to the Office of the Presidency\u2014including in the\nCFPB\u2019s case, rulemaking review\u2014to exert influence over\ndiscretionary policy calls. Seesupra, at 33, and n. 13.\nSecond, the majority has nothing but intuition to back up its\nessentially functionalist claim that the CFPB would be less capable\nof exercising power if it had more than one Director (even\nsupposing that were a suitable issue for a court to address).Ante, at 21, 23. Maybe the CFPB would be. Or maybe not.\nAlthough a multimember format tends to frustrate the President\u2019s\ncontrol over an agency, seesupra, at 34\u201335, it may not\nlessen the agency\u2019s own ability to act with decision and dispatch.\n(Consider, for a recent example, the Federal Reserve Board.) That\neffect presumably would depend on the agency\u2019s internal\norganization, voting rules, and similar matters. At the least: If\nthe Court is going to invalidate statutes based on empirical\nassertions like this one, it should offer some empirical support.\nIt should not pretend that its assessment that the CFPB wields more\npower more dangerously than the SEC comes from someplace in the\nConstitution. But today the majority fails to accord even that\nminimal respect to Congress.IIIRecall again how this dispute got started. In\nthe midst of the Great Recession, Congress and the President came\ntogether to create an agency with an important mission. It would\nprotect consumers from the reckless financial practices that had\ncaused the then-ongoing economic collapse. Not only Congress but\nalso the President thought that the new agency, to fulfill its\nmandate, needed a measure of independence. So the two political\nbranches, acting together, gave the CFPB Director the same job\nprotection that innumerable other agency heads possess. All in all,\nthose branches must have thought, they had done a good day\u2019s work.\nRelying on their experience and knowledge of administration, they\nhad built an agency in the way best suited to carry out its\nfunctions. They had protected the public from financial chicanery\nand crisis. They had governed.And now consider how the dispute ends\u2014with five\nunelected judges rejecting the result of that democratic process.\nThe outcome today will not shut down the CFPB: A different majority\nof this Court, including all those who join this opinion, believes\nthatifthe agency\u2019s removal provision is unconstitutional,\nit should be severed. But the majority on constitutionality\njettisons a measure Congress and the President viewed as integral\nto the way the agency should operate. The majority does so even\nthough the Constitution grants to Congress, acting with the\nPresident\u2019s approval, the authority to create and shape\nadministrative bodies. And even though those branches, as compared\nto courts, have far greater understanding of political control\nmechanisms and agency design.Nothing in the Constitution requires that\noutcome; to the contrary. \u201cWhile the Constitution diffuses power\nthe better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice\nwill integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government.\u201dYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co.v.Sawyer,343 U.S.\n579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The Framers took\npains to craft a document that would allow the structures of\ngovernance to change, as times and needs change. The Constitution\nsays only a few words about administration. As Chief Justice\nMarshall wrote: Rather than prescribing \u201cimmutable rules,\u201d it\nenables Congress to choose \u201cthe means by which government should,\nin all future time, execute its powers.\u201dMcCulloch, 4\nWheat., at 415. It authorizes Congress to meet new exigencies with\nnew devices. So Article II does not generally prohibit independent\nagencies. Nor do any supposed structural principles. Nor do any\nodors wafting from the document. Save for when those agencies\nimpede the President\u2019s performance of his own constitutional\nduties, the matter is left up to Congress.Our history has stayed true to the Framers\u2019\nvision. Congress has accepted their invitation to experiment with\nadministrative forms\u2014nowhere more so than in the field of financial\nregulation. And this Court has mostly allowed it to do so. The\nresult is a broad array of independent agencies, no two exactly\nalike but all with a measure of insulation from the President\u2019s\nremoval power. The Federal Reserve Board; the FTC; the SEC; maybe\nsome you\u2019ve never heard of. As to each, Congress thought that\nformal job protection for policymaking would produce regulatory\noutcomes in greater accord with the long-term public interest.\nCongress may have been right; or it may have been wrong; or maybe\nit was some of both. No matter\u2014the branches accountable to the\npeople have decided how the people should be governed.The CFPB should have joined the ranks. Maybe it\nwill still do so, even under today\u2019s opinion: The majority tells\nCongress that it may \u201cpursu[e] alternative responses\u201d to the\nidentified constitutional defect\u2014\u201cfor example, converting the CFPB\ninto a multimember agency.\u201dAnte, at 36. But there was no\nneed to send Congress back to the drawing board. The Constitution\ndoes not distinguish between single-director and multimember\nindependent agencies. It instructs Congress, not this Court, to\ndecide on agency design. Because this Court ignores that\nsensible\u2014indeed, that obvious\u2014division of tasks, I respectfully\ndissent.Notes1In the academic\nliterature, compare,e.g.,Kagan, Presidential\nAdministration, 114 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2245, 2331\u20132346 (2001)\n(generally favoring presidential control over agencies), with,e.g.,Strauss, Overseer, or \u201cThe Decider\u201d? The President in\nAdministrative Law, 75 Geo. Wash. L.\u00a0Rev. 696, 704, 713\u2013715\n(2007) (generally favoring administrative\nindependence).2The principle of\nseparation of powers, Madison continued, main-tained only that\n\u201cwhere thewholepower of one department is exercised by the\nsame hands which possess thewholepower of another\ndepartment, the fundamental principles of a free\nconstitution[\u00a0] are subverted.\u201d The Federalist No. 47, at\n325\u2013326.3Article II\u2019s Opinions\nClause also demonstrates the possibility of limits on the\nPresident\u2019s control over the Executive Branch. Under that Clause,\nthe President \u201cmay require the Opinion, in writing, of the\nprincipal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any\nSubject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\u201d \u00a72,\ncl. 1. For those in the majority\u2019s camp, that Clause presents a\npuzzle: If the President must always have the direct supervisory\ncontrol they posit, including by threat of removal, why would he\never need a constitutional warrant to demand agency heads\u2019\nopinions? The Clause becomes at least redundant\u2014though really,\ninexplicable\u2014under the majority\u2019s idea of executive\npower.4The majority dismisses\nFederalist Nos. 77 and 39 as \u201creflect[ing] initial impressions\nlater abandoned.\u201dAnte,at 26, and n.\u00a010. But even\nHamilton\u2019s and Madison\u2019s later impressions are less helpful to the\nmajority than it suggests. Assuming Hamilton gave up on the\nSenate\u2019s direct participation in removal (the evidence is sketchy\nbut plausible), there is no evidence to show he accepted the\nmajority\u2019s view. And while Madison opposed the first Congress\u2019s\nenactment of removal limits (as the majority highlights), he also\nmaintained that the legislature had constitutional power to protect\nthe Comptroller of the Treasury from at-will firing. Seeinfra, at 12\u201313. In any event, such changing minds and\ninconstant opinions don\u2019t usually prove the existence of\nconstitutional rules.5As President Jefferson\nexplained: \u201c[W]ith the settlement of the accounts at the Treasury I\nhave no right to interfere in the least,\u201d because the Comptroller\nof the Treasury \u201cis the sole & supreme judge for all claims of\nmoney against the US. and would no more receive a direction from\nme\u201d than would \u201cone of the judges of the supreme court.\u201d Letter\nfrom T. Jefferson to B. Latrobe (June 2, 1808), in Thomas Jefferson\nand the National Capital 429, 431 (S. Padover ed. 1946). A couple\nof decades later, Attorney General William Wirt reached the same\nconclusion, stating that \u201cthe President has no right to interpose\nin the settling of accounts\u201d because Congress had \u201cseparated\u201d the\nComptroller from the President\u2019s authority. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 636,\n637 (1824); 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 678, 680 (1824). And indeed, Wirt\nbelieved that Congress could restrict the President\u2019s authority to\nremove such officials, at least so long as it \u201cexpress[ed] that\nintention clearly.\u201d 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 212, 213 (1818).6The Comptroller\nlegislation of the Civil War provided a key precedent for whatdoesappear a historical \u201caberration\u201d\u2014the Tenure of Office\nAct of 1867. See ch. 154, 14Stat. 430. Anxious to prevent President\nAndrew Johnson from interfering with reconstruction\npolicies\u2014including through his command of the military\u2014Congress\nbarred presidential removal of any Senate-confirmed officials\nwithout the Senate\u2019s consent. The law thus severed the President\u2019s\nremoval authority over even officials like the Secretaries of War\nand State. The statute became the basis for the Nation\u2019s first\npresidential impeachment, but was repealed in 1887. See Act of Mar.\n3, 1887, ch. 353, 24Stat. 500. In one sense, the two-decade-long\nexistence of the Tenure of Office Act reveals the 19th-century\npolitical system\u2019s comfort with expansive restrictions on\npresidential removal. But the ultimate repudiation of the law, and\nthe broad historical consensus that it went too far, just as\nstrongly shows the limits that system later accepted on legislative\npower\u2014that Congress may not impose removal restrictions preventing\nthe President from carrying out his own constitutionally assigned\nfunctions in areas like war or foreign affairs. SeeMorrisonv.Olson,487 U.S.\n654, 689\u2013691 (1988) (recognizing that limit as the\nconstitutional standard).7The majority is quite\nright that today we viewallthe activities of\nadministrative agencies as exercises of \u201cthe \u2018executive\nPower.\u2019\u00a0\u201dArlingtonv.FCC,569 U.S.\n290, 305, n.\u00a04 (2013) (quoting Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl.1);\nseeante,at 14, n.\u00a02. But we well understand, just as\ntheHumphrey\u2019sCourt did, that those activities may \u201ctake\n\u2018legislative\u2019 and \u2018judicial\u2019 forms.\u201dArlington, 569\nU.\u00a0S., at 305, n. 4.The classic examples are agency\nrulemakings and adjudications, endemic in agencies like the FTC and\nCFPB. In any event, the Court would soon make clear that Congress\ncan also constrain the President\u2019s removal authority over officials\nperforming even the most \u201cexecutive\u201d of functions. Seeinfra, at 19\u201320.8Expressing veiled\ncontempt as only he could, Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court\nthat Chief Justice Taft\u2019s opinion had \u201claboriously traversed\u201d\nAmerican history and that it had failed to \u201crestrict itself to the\nimmediate issue before it.\u201d 357 U.\u00a0S., at 351. No wonderHumphrey\u2019shad \u201cnarrowly confined the scope of theMyersdecision.\u201d 357 U.\u00a0S.,at 352. Justice\nFrankfurter implied that the \u201cChief Justice who himself had been\nPresident\u201d was lucky his handiwork had not been altogether\nreversed.Id.,at 351.9Pretending this analysis is\nmine rather thanMorrison\u2019s, the majority registers its\ndisagreement. Seeante,at 27\u201328, n.\u00a011. In its view, a\ntest asking whether a for-cause provision impedes the President\u2019s\nability to carry out his constitutional functions has \u201cno real\nlimiting principle.\u201dIbid.If the provision leaves the\nPresident with constitutionally sufficient control over some\nsubordinates (like the independent counsel), the majority asks, why\nnot over even his close military or diplomatic advisers? Seeibid.But the Constitution itself supplies the answer. If\nthe only presidential duty at issue is the one to ensure faithful\nexecution of the laws, a for-cause provision does not stand in the\nway: AsMorrisonrecognized, it preserves authority in the\nPresident to ensure (just as the Take Care Clause requires) that an\nofficial is abiding by law. See 487 U.\u00a0S., at 692. But now\nsuppose an additional constitutional duty is implicated\u2014relating,\nsay, to the conduct of foreign affairs or war. To carry out those\nduties, the President needs advisers who will (beyond complying\nwith law) help him devise and implement policy. And that means he\nneeds the capacity to fire such advisers for disagreeing with his\npolicy calls.10The\nmajority suggests that the FTC was a different animal when this\nCourt upheld its independent status inHumphrey\u2019s. Seeante,at 17. But then, as now, the FTC\u2019s organic statute\nbroadly \u201cempowered and directed\u201d the agency \u201cto prevent persons\u201d or\nbusinesses \u201cfrom using unfair methods of competition in commerce.\u201d\nAct of Sept. 26, 1914, \u00a75, 38Stat. 719. To fulfill that mandate,\nthe agency could and did run investigations, bring administrative\ncharges, and conduct adjudications. Seeibid.; \u00a76(a),id., at 721; FTC Ann. Rep. (1935) (describing the FTC\u2019s\nextensive enforcement activities in the year beforeHumphrey\u2019s). And if any person refused to comply with an\norder, the agency could seek its enforcement in federal court under\na highly deferential standard. See \u00a75, 38Stat. 720;FTCv.Pacific States Paper Trade Assn.,273 U.S.\n52, 63 (1927). Still more, the FTC has always had statutory\nrulemaking authority, even though (like several other agencies) it\nrelied on adjudications until the 1960s. See \u00a76(g), 38Stat. 722;National Petroleum Refiners Assn.v.FTC, 482 F.2d\n672, 686 (CADC 1973). (The majority\u2019s reply that a court including\nCharles Evans Hughes, Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan\nStone somehow misunderstood these powers, seeante,at 17,\nn.\u00a04, lacks all plausibility.) And in any case, the relevant\npoint of comparison is the present-day FTC, which remains\nindependent even if it now has some expanded powers\u2014and which\nremains constitutional under not onlyHumphrey\u2019sbut alsoMorrison. Seesupra,at 18\u201320.11The\nmajority briefly mentions, but understandably does not rely on, two\nother features of Congress\u2019s scheme. First, the majority notes that\nthe CFPB receives its funding outside the normal appropriations\nprocess. Seeante, at 24\u201325. But so too do other financial\nregulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. See\n12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7243, 1815(d), 1820(e). And budgetary\nindependence comes mostly at the expense of Congress\u2019s control over\nthe agency, not the President\u2019s. (Because that is so, it actually\nworks to the President\u2019s advantage.) Second, the majority complains\nthat the Director\u2019s five-year term may prevent a President from\n\u201cshap[ing the agency\u2019s] leadership\u201d through appointments.Ante, at 24. But again that is true, to one degree or\nanother, of quite a few longstanding independent agencies,\nincluding the Federal Reserve, the FTC, the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, and the Postal Service Board of Governors. See,e.g., \u00a7\u00a7241, 242; 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741; 5\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71201, 1202; 39 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7202. (If\nyou think the last is unimportant, just ask the current President\nwhether he agrees.)12The\nmajority, seeking some other way to distinguishMorrison,\nasserts that the independent counsel\u2019s \u201cduties\u201d were more \u201climited\u201d\nthan the CFPB Director\u2019s.Ante, at 17\u201318. That\u2019s true in a\nsense: All (all?) the special counsel had to do was decide whether\nthe President and his top advisers had broken the law. But I doubt\n(and I suspect Presidents would too) whether the need to control\nthose duties was any less \u201ccentral to the functioning of the\nExecutive Branch\u201d than the need to control the CFPB\u2019s.Morrison, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 691\u2013692. And in any event, as\nI\u2019ve shown,Morrisondid much more than approve a specific\nremoval provision; it created a standard to govern all removal\ncases that is at complete odds with the majority\u2019s reasoning. Seesupra,at 19\u201321.13To\nuse one important example, Congress provided for executive\noversight of all the CFPB\u2019s rulemaking. The Financial Stability\nOversight Council can veto by a two-thirds vote any CFPB regulation\nit deems a threat to the \u201csafety and soundness\u201d of the financial\nsystem. 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75513(a). The FSOC is chaired by the\nTreasury Secretary, and most of its members are under the direct\nsupervision of the President. See \u00a75321. So the majority is wrong\nin saying that the CFPB\u2019s Director can \u201cunilaterally\u201d issue\nfinal regulations.Ante, at 23 (emphasis in original).\nIndeed, the President has more control over rulemaking at the CFPB\nthan at any similar independent agency. And the majority is\nsimilarly wrong to think that because the FSOC has not yet issued a\nformal veto, its review authority makes no practical difference.\nSeeante,at 25, n.\u00a09. Regulatory review, whether by\nthe Office of Management and Budget or the FSOC, usually relies\nmore on the threat of vetoes than on their execution. OMB casts a\nlong shadow over rulemaking in the Executive Branch, but rarely\nuses its veto pen. See Sunstein, The Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs: Myths and Realities, 126 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev.\n1838, 1846\u20131847, n. 37 (2013).14I\ncould go on. A recent study prepared for the Administrative\nConference of the United States noted that \u201c[g]overnance by\nmultiple members limits the President\u2019s influence.\u201d J. Selin &\nD. Lewis, Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies 89 (2d ed.\n2018). And the General Accounting Office has recognized that the\ndesire for \u201cgreater independence\u201d is what \u201cmost likely explains why\nthe Congress in the past has opted to head independent regulatory\nbodies with multimember commissions rather than single\nadministrators.\u201d Hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on the\nConsumer of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n100th Cong., 1st Sess., 135 (1987) (Statement of F.\nFrazier).",
