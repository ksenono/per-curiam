S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-6053DWAYNE GILES, PETITIONERv.CALIFORNIAon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ncalifornia[June 25, 2008]Justice Alito, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion, but I\nwrite separately to make clear that, like Justice Thomas, I am not\nconvinced that the out-of-court statement at issue here fell within\nthe Confrontation Clause in the first place. The dissent\u2019s\ndispleasure with the result in this case is understandable, but I\nsuggest that the real problem concerns the scope of the\nconfrontation right. The Confrontation Clause does not apply to\nout-of-court statements unless it can be said that they are the\nequivalent of statements made at trial by \u201cwitnesses.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 6. It is not at all clear that Ms. Avie\u2019s statement\nfalls within that category. But the question whether Ms. Avie\u2019s\nstatement falls within the scope of the Clause is not before us,\nand assuming for the sake of argument that the statement falls\nwithin the Clause, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the\ndoctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.",
