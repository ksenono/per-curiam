KAHLER, PETITIONERv.KANSASon writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nkansas[March 23, 2020]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.This case is about Kansas\u2019s treatment of a\ncriminal defendant\u2019s insanity claim. In Kansas, a defendant can\ninvoke mental illness to show that he lacked the requisitemens\nrea(intent) for a crime. He can also raise mental illness\nafter conviction to justify either a reduced term of imprisonment\nor commitment to a mental health facility. But Kansas, unlike many\nStates, will not wholly exonerate a defendant on the ground that\nhis illness prevented him from recognizing his criminal act as\nmorally wrong. The issue here is whether the Constitution\u2019s Due\nProcess Clause forces Kansas to do so\u2014otherwise said, whether that\nClause compels the acquittal of any defendant who, because of\nmental illness, could not tell right from wrong when committing his\ncrime. We hold that the Clause imposes no such requirement.IAInClarkv.Arizona,548 U.S.\n735, 749 (2006), this Court catalogued state insanity defenses,\ncounting four \u201cstrains variously combined to yield a diversity of\nAmerican standards\u201d for when to absolve mentally ill defendants of\ncriminal culpability. The first strain asks about a defendant\u2019s\n\u201ccognitive capacity\u201d\u2014whether a mental illness left him \u201cunable to\nunderstand what he [was] doing\u201d when he committed a crime.Id., at 747, 749. The second examines his \u201cmoral\ncapacity\u201d\u2014whether his illness rendered him \u201cun- able to understand\nthat his action [was] wrong.\u201dIbid.Those two inquiries,Clarkexplained, appeared as alternative pathways to\nacquittal in the landmark English rulingM\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case,\n10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (H. L. 1843), as well as in\nmany follow-on American decisions and statutes: If the defendant\nlacks either cognitive or moral capacity, he is not criminally\nresponsible for his behavior. Yet a third \u201cbuilding block[\u00a0]\u201d\nof state insanity tests, gaining popularity from the mid-19th\ncentury on, focuses on \u201cvolitional incapacity\u201d\u2014whether a\ndefendant\u2019s mental illness made him subject to\n\u201cirresistible[\u00a0] impulse[s]\u201d or otherwise unable to\n\u201ccontrol[\u00a0] his actions.\u201dClark, 548 U.\u00a0S., at\n749, 750, n.\u00a011; see,e.g.,Parsonsv.State, 81 Ala. 577, 597, 2 So. 854, 866\u2013867 (1887). And\nbringing up the rear, inClark\u2019s narration, the\n\u201cproduct-of-mental-illness test\u201d broadly considers whether the\ndefendant\u2019s criminal act stemmed from a mental disease. 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 749\u2013750.AsClarkexplained, even that taxonomy\nfails to capture the field\u2019s complexity. Seeid., at 750,\nn.\u00a011. Most notable here,M\u2019Naghten\u2019s \u201cmoral capacity\u201d\nprong later produced a spinoff, adopted in many States, that does\nnot refer to morality at all. Instead of examining whether a\nmentally ill defendant could grasp that his act wasimmoral,\nsome jurisdictions took to asking whether the defendant could\nunderstand that his act wasillegal. Compare,e.g.,Peoplev.Schmidt, 216 N.Y. 324, 333\u2013334, 110 N.E.\n945, 947 (1915) (Cardozo, J.) (asking about moral right and wrong),\nwith,e.g.,Statev.Hamann,285 N.W.2d 180, 183 (Iowa 1979) (substituting ideas of legal\nright and wrong). That change in legal standard matters when a\nmentally ill defendant knew that his act violated the law yet\nbelieved it morally justified. See,e.g.,Schmidt,\n216 N.\u00a0Y., at 339, 110 N.\u00a0E., at 949;Peoplev.Serravo,823 P.2d 128, 135 (Colo. 1992).[1]Kansas law provides that \u201c[i]t shall be a\ndefense to a prosecution under any statute that the defendant, as a\nresult of mental disease or defect, lacked the culpable mental\nstate required as an element of the offense charged.\u201d Kan. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a721\u20135209 (2018 Cum. Supp.).[2] Under that statute, a defendant may introduce any\nevidence of any mental illness to show that he did not have the\nintent needed to commit the charged crime. Suppose, for example,\nthat the defendant shot someone dead and goes on trial for murder.\nHe may then offer psychiatric testimony that he did not understand\nthe function of a gun or the consequences of its use\u2014more generally\nstated, \u201cthe nature and quality\u201d of his actions.M\u2019Naghten,\n10 Cl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722. And a jury\ncrediting that testimony must acquit him. As everyone here agrees,\nKansas law thus usesM\u2019Naghten\u2019s \u201ccognitive capacity\u201d\nprong\u2014the inquiry into whether a mentally ill defendant could\ncomprehend what he was doing when he committed a crime. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 41; Brief for Respondent 31; Brief for United States\nasAmicus Curiae18. If the defendant had no such capacity,\nhe could not form the requisite intent\u2014and thus is not criminally\nresponsible.At the same time, the Kansas statute provides\nthat \u201c[m]ental disease or defect is not otherwise a defense.\u201d\n\u00a721\u20135209. In other words, Kansas does not recognize any additional\nway that mental illness can produce an acquittal.[3] Most important for this case, a\ndefendant\u2019s moral incapacity cannot exonerate him, as it would if\nKansas had adoptedbothoriginal prongs ofM\u2019Naghten.\nAssume, for example, that a defendant killed someone because of an\n\u201cinsane delusion that God ha[d] ordained the sacrifice.\u201dSchmidt, 216 N.\u00a0Y., at 339, 110 N.\u00a0E., at 949. The\ndefendant knew what he was doing (killing another person), but he\ncould not tell moral right from wrong; indeed, he thought the\nmurder morally justified. In many States, that fact would preclude\na criminal conviction, although it would almost always lead to\ncommitment in a mental health facility. In Kansas, by contrast,\nevidence of a mentally ill defendant\u2019s moral incapacity\u2014or indeed,\nof anything except his cognitive inability to form the neededmens rea\u2014can play no role in determining guilt.That partly closed-door policy changes once a\nverdict is in. At the sentencing phase, a Kansas defendant has wide\nlatitude to raise his mental illness as a reason to judge him not\nfully culpable and so to lessen his punishment. See\n\u00a7\u00a721\u20136815(c)(1)(C), 21\u20136625(a). He may present evidence (of the\nkindM\u2019Naghtendeemed relevant) that his disease made him\nunable to understand his act\u2019s moral wrongness\u2014as in the example\njust given of religious delusion. See \u00a721\u20136625(a).Or he may\ntry to show (in line withM\u2019Naghten\u2019s spinoff\u00a0) that\nthe illness prevented him from \u201cappreciat[ing] the [conduct\u2019s]\ncriminality.\u201d \u00a721\u20136625(a)(6). Or again, he may offer testimony\n(here invoking volitional incapacity) that he simply could not\n\u201cconform [his] conduct\u201d to legal restraints.Ibid.Kansas\nsentencing law thus provides for an individualized determination of\nhow mental illness, in any or all of its aspects, affects\nculpability. And the same kind of evidence can persuade a court to\nplace a defendant who needs psychiatric care in a mental health\nfacility rather than a prison. See \u00a722\u20133430. In that way, a\ndefendant in Kansas lacking, say, moral capacity may wind up in the\nsame kind of institution as a like defendant in a State that would\nbar his conviction.BThis case arises from a terrible crime. In\nearly 2009, Karen Kahler filed for divorce from James Kahler and\nmoved out of their home with their two teenage daughters and\n9-year-old son. Over the following months, James Kahler became more\nand more distraught. On Thanksgiving weekend, he drove to the home\nof Karen\u2019s grandmother, where he knew his family was staying.\nKahler entered through the back door and saw Karen and his son. He\nshot Karen twice, while allowing his son to flee the house. He then\nmoved through the residence, shooting Karen\u2019s grandmother and each\nof his daughters in turn. All four of his victims died. Kahler\nsurrendered to the police the next day and was charged with capital\nmurder.Before trial, Kahler filed a motion arguing that\nKansas\u2019s treatment of insanity claims violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Kansas, he asserted, had\n\u201cunconstitutionally abolished the insanity defense\u201d by allowing the\nconviction of a mentally ill person \u201cwho cannot tell the difference\nbetween right and wrong.\u201d App. 11\u201312. The trial court denied the\nmotion, leaving Kahler to attempt to show through psychiatric and\nother testimony that severe depression had prevented him from\nforming the intent to kill. Seeid., at 16; \u00a721\u20135209. The\njury convicted Kahler of capital murder. At the penalty phase, the\ncourt permitted Kahler to offer additional evidence of his mental\nillness and to argue in whatever way he liked that it should\nmitigate his sentence. The jury still decided to impose the death\npenalty.Kahler appealed, again challenging the\nconstitutionality of Kansas\u2019s approach to insanity claims. The\nKansas Supreme Court rejected his argument, relying on an earlier\nprecedential decision. See 307 Kan. 374, 400\u2013401, 410 P.3d 105,\n124\u2013125 (2018) (discussingStatev.Bethel, 275 Kan.\n456, 66 P.3d 840 (2003)). There, the court denied that any single\nversion of the insanity defense is so \u201cingrained in our legal\nsystem\u201d as to count as \u201cfundamental.\u201dId., at 473, 66\nP.\u00a03d, at 851. The court thus found that \u201c[d]ue process does\nnot mandate that a State adopt a particular insanity test.\u201dIbid.Kahler then asked this Court to decide whether\nthe Due Process Clause requires States to provide an insanity\ndefense that acquits a defendant who could not \u201cdistinguish right\nfrom wrong\u201d when committing his crime\u2014or, otherwise put, whether\nthat Clause requires States to adopt the moral-incapacity test fromM\u2019Naghten. Pet. for Cert. 18. We granted certiorari, 586\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), and now hold it does not.[4]IIAA challenge like Kahler\u2019s must surmount a high\nbar. Under well-settled precedent, a state rule about criminal\nliability\u2014laying out either the elements of or the defenses to a\ncrime\u2014violates due process only if it \u201coffends some principle of\njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as\nto be ranked as fundamental.\u201dLelandv.Oregon,343 U.S.\n790, 798 (1952) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our primary\nguide in applying that standard is \u201chistorical practice.\u201dMontanav.Egelhoff,518 U.S.\n37, 43 (1996) (plurality opinion). And in assessing that\npractice, we look primarily to eminent common-law authorities\n(Blackstone, Coke, Hale, and the like), as well as to early English\nand American judicial decisions. See,e.g.,id., at\n44\u201345;Pattersonv.New York,432\nU.S. 197, 202 (1977). The question is whether a rule of\ncriminal responsibility is so old and venerable\u2014so entrenched in\nthe central values of our legal system\u2014as to prevent a State from\never choosing another. An affirmative answer, though not unheard\nof, is rare. See,e.g.,Clark, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 752\n(\u201c[T]he conceptualization of criminal offenses\u201d is mostly left to\nthe States).InPowellv.Texas,392 U.S.\n514(1968), this Court explained why. There, Texas declined to\nrecognize \u201cchronic alcoholism\u201d as a defense to the crime of public\ndrunkenness.Id., at 517 (plurality opinion). The Court\nupheld that decision, emphasizing the paramount role of the States\nin setting \u201cstandards of criminal responsibility.\u201dId., at\n533. In refusing to impose \u201ca constitutional doctrine\u201d defining\nthose standards, the Court invoked the many \u201cinterlocking and\noverlapping concepts\u201d that the law uses to assess when a person\nshould be held criminally accountable for \u201chis antisocial deeds.\u201dId., at 535\u2013536. \u201cThe doctrines ofactus reus,mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and duress\u201d\u2014the\nCourt counted them off\u2014reflect both the \u201cevolving aims of the\ncriminal law\u201d and the \u201cchanging religious, moral, philosophical,\nand medical views of the nature of man.\u201dId., at 536. Or\nsaid a bit differently, crafting those doctrines involves balancing\nand rebalancing over time complex and oft-competing ideas about\n\u201csocial policy\u201d and \u201cmoral culpability\u201d\u2014about the criminal law\u2019s\n\u201cpractical effectiveness\u201d and its \u201cethical foundations.\u201dId., at 538, 545, 548 (Black, J., concurring). That\n\u201cconstantly shifting adjustment\u201d could not proceed in the face of\nrigid \u201c[c]onstitution[al] formulas.\u201dId., at 536\u2013537\n(plurality opinion). Within broad limits,Powellthus\nconcluded, \u201cdoctrine[s] of criminal responsibility\u201d must remain\n\u201cthe province of the States.\u201dId., at 534, 536.Nowhere has the Court hewed more closely to that\nview than in addressing the contours of the insanity defense. Here,\nuncertainties about the human mind loom large. See,e.g.,Akev.Oklahoma,470 U.S.\n68, 81 (1985) (\u201c[P]sychiatrists disagree widely and frequently\non what constitutes mental illness, on [proper] diagnos[es, and] on\ncure and treatment\u201d). Even as some puzzles get resolved, others\nemerge. And those perennial gaps in knowledge intersect with\ndiffering opinions about how far, and in what ways, mental illness\nshould excuse criminal conduct. SeeClark, 548 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 749\u2013752 (canvassing how those competing views produced a wealth\nof insanity tests);supra, at 1\u20132. \u201cThis whole problem,\u201d we\nhave noted, \u201chas evoked wide disagreement.\u201dLeland, 343\nU.\u00a0S., at 801. On such unsettled ground, we have hesitated to\nreduce \u201cexperimentation, and freeze [the] dialogue between law and\npsychiatry into a rigid constitutional mold.\u201dPowell, 392\nU.\u00a0S., at 536\u2013537. Indeed, while addressing the demand for an\nalcoholism defense inPowell, the Court pronounced\u2014as\nsomething close to self-evident\u2014that \u201c[n]othing could be less\nfruitful\u201d than to define a specific \u201cinsanity test in\nconstitutional terms.\u201dId., at 536.And twice before we have declined to do so. InLelandv.Oregon, a criminal defendant challenged as\na violation of due process the State\u2019s use of the moral-incapacity\ntest of insanity\u2014the very test Kahler now asks us to require. See\n343 U.\u00a0S., at 800\u2013801. According to the defendant, Oregon\ninstead had to adopt the volitional-incapacity (or\nirresistible-impulse) test to comply with the Constitution. Seeibid.;supra, at 2. We rejected that argument.\n\u201c[P]sychiatry,\u201d we first noted, \u201chas made tremendous strides since\n[the moral-incapacity] test was laid down inM\u2019Naghten\u2019s\nCase,\u201d implying that the test seemed a tad outdated. 343\nU.\u00a0S., at 800\u2013801. But still, we reasoned, \u201cthe progress of\nscience has not reached a point where its learning\u201d would demand\n\u201celiminat[ing] the right and wrong test from [the] criminal law.\u201dId., at 801. And anyway, we continued, the \u201cchoice of a test\nof legal sanity involves not only scientific knowledge but\nquestions of basic policy\u201d about when mental illness should absolve\nsomeone of \u201ccriminal responsibility.\u201dIbid.The matter was\nthus best left to each State to decide on its own. The dissent\nagreed (while parting from the majority on another ground): \u201c[I]t\nwould be indefensible to impose upon the States[\u00a0] one test\nrather than another for determining criminal culpability\u201d for the\nmentally ill, \u201cand thereby to displace a State\u2019s own choice.\u201dId., at 803 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).A half-century later, we reasoned similarly inClark. There, the defendant objected to Arizona\u2019s decision\nto discard the cognitive-incapacity prong ofM\u2019Naghtenand\nleave in place only the moral-incapacity one\u2014essentially the\nflipside of what Kansas has done. Again, we saw no due process\nproblem. Many States, we acknowledged, allowed a defendant to show\ninsanity through either prong ofM\u2019Naghten. See 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 750. But we denied that this approach \u201crepresents\nthe minimum that a government must provide.\u201dId., at 748. In\nso doing, we invoked the States\u2019 traditional \u201ccapacity to define\ncrimes and defenses,\u201d and noted how views of mental illness had\nbeen particularly \u201csubject to flux and disagreement.\u201dId.,\nat 749, 752. And then we surveyed the disparate ways that state\nlaws had historically excused criminal conduct because of mental\ndisease\u2014those \u201cstrains variously combined to yield a diversity of\nAmerican standards.\u201d Seeid., at 749\u2013752;supra, at\n1\u20132. The takeaway was \u201cclear\u201d: A State\u2019s \u201cinsanity rule[\u00a0] is\nsubstantially open to state choice.\u201dClark, 548 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 752. ReiteratingPowell\u2019s statement,Clarkheld\nthat \u201cno particular\u201d insanity test serves as \u201ca baseline for due\nprocess.\u201d 548 U.\u00a0S., at 752. Or said just a bit differently,\nthat \u201cdue process imposes no single canonical formulation of legal\ninsanity.\u201dId., at 753.BYet Kahler maintains that Kansas\u2019s treatment\nof insanity fails to satisfy due process. He sometimes makes his\nargument in the broadest of strokes, as he did before trial. Seesupra, at 5. Kansas, he then contends, has altogether\n\u201cabolished the insanity defense,\u201d in disregard of hundreds of years\nof historical practice. Brief for Petitioner 39. His central claim,\nthough, is more confined. It is that Kansas has impermissibly\njettisoned the moral-incapacity test for insanity. Seeid.,\nat 12, 23. As earlier noted, bothClarkandLelanddescribed that test as coming fromM\u2019Naghten. See 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 749; 343 U.\u00a0S., at 801;supra, at 2, 8.\nBut according to Kahler (and the dissent), the moral-incapacity\ninquiry emerged centuries before that decision, thus forming part\nof the English common-law heritage this country inherited. See\nBrief for Petitioner 21, 42;post, at 4\u201314 (opinion of\nBreyer, J.). And the test, he claims, served for all that time\u2014and\ncontinuing into the present\u2014as the touchstone of legal insanity: If\na defendant could not understand that his act was morally wrong,\nthen he could not be found criminally liable. See Brief for\nPetitioner 20\u201323; see alsopost, at 15. So Kahler concludes\nthat the moral-incapacity standard is a \u201cprinciple of justice so\nrooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be\nranked as fundamental.\u201dLeland, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 798; seesupra, at 6. In essence\u2014and contraClark\u2014that testisthe \u201csingle canonical formulation of legal insanity\u201d and\nthus the irreducible \u201cbaseline for due process.\u201d 548 U.\u00a0S., at\n752\u2013753; seesupra, at 9.[5]One point, first, of agreement: Kahler is right\nthat for hundreds of years jurists and judges have recognized\ninsanity (however defined) as relieving responsibility for a crime.\n\u201cIn criminal cases therefore,\u201d Sir William Blackstone wrote,\n\u201clunatics are not chargeable for their own acts, if committed when\nunder these incapacities.\u201d 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 24\n(1769). Sir Edward Coke even earlier explained that in criminal\ncases, \u201cthe act and wrong of a mad man shall not be imputed to\nhim.\u201d 2 Institutes of the Laws of England \u00a7405, p.\u00a0247b (1628)\n(Coke). And so too Henry de Bracton thought that a \u201cmadman\u201d could\nno sooner be found criminally liable than a child. 2 Bracton on\nLaws and Customs of England 384 (S. Thorne transl. 1968) (Bracton).\nThat principle of non-culpability appeared in case after case\ninvolving allegedly insane defendants, on both sides of the\nAtlantic. \u201cThe defense of insanity[\u00a0] is a defense for all\ncrimes[,] from the highest to the lowest,\u201d said the Court in Old\nBailey.Trial of Samuel Burt(July 19, 1786), in 6\nProceedings in the Old Bailey 874 (E. Hodgson ed. 1788) (Old Bailey\nProceedings). Repeated Justice Story, when riding circuit: \u201cIn\ngeneral, insanity is an excuse for the commission of every crime,\nbecause the party has not the possession of that reason, which\nincludes responsibility.\u201dUnited Statesv.Drew, 25\nF. Cas. 913 (No. 14,993) (CC Mass. 1828); see also,e.g.,Statev.Marler, 2 Ala. 43, 49 (1841) (\u201cIf the\nprisoner was insane, he was not an accountable being\u201d);Cornwellv.State, 8 Tenn. 147, 156 (1827)\n(\u201c[P]erfect madness\u201d will \u201cfree a man from punishment for crime\u201d).\nWe have not found a single case to the contrary.But neither do we think Kansas departs from that\nbroad principle. First, Kansas has an insanity defense negating\ncriminal liability\u2014even though not the type Kahler demands. As\nnoted earlier, Kansas law provides that it is \u201ca defense to a\nprosecution\u201d that \u201cthe defendant, as a result of mental disease or\ndefect, lacked the culpable mental state required\u201d for a crime.\n\u00a721\u20135209; seesupra, at 3. That provision enables a\ndefendant to present psychiatric and other evidence of mental\nillness to defend himself against a criminal charge. More\nspecifically, the defendant can use that evidence to show that his\nillness left him without the cognitive capacity to form the\nrequisite intent. Seesupra, at 3. Recall that such a\ndefense was exactly what the defendant inClarkwanted, in\npreference to Arizona\u2019s moral-incapacity defense: His\n(unsuccessful) appeal rested on the trial court\u2019s exclusion of\npsychiatric testimony to show that he lacked the relevantmens\nrea. See 548 U.\u00a0S., at 745\u2013747;supra, at 9. Here,\nKahler could do what Clark could not\u2014try to show through such\ntestimony that he had no intent to kill. Of course, Kahler would\nhave preferred Arizona\u2019s kind of insanity defense (just as Clark\nwould have liked Kansas\u2019s). But that does not mean that Kansas (any\nmore than Arizona) failed to offer any insanity defense at all.Second, and significantly, Kansas permits a\ndefendant to offer whatever mental health evidence he deems\nrelevant at sentencing. See \u00a7\u00a721\u20136815(c)(1)(C), 21\u20136625(a);supra, at 4. A mentally ill defendant may argue there that\nhe is not blameworthy because he could not tell the difference\nbetween right and wrong. Or, because he did not know his conduct\nbroke the law. Or, because he could not control his behavior. Or,\nbecause of anything else. In other words, any manifestation of\nmental illness that Kansas\u2019s guilt-phase insanity defense\ndisregards\u2014including the moral incapacity Kahler highlights\u2014can\ncome in later to mitigate culpability and lessen punishment. And\nthat same kind of evidence can persuade a judge to replace any\nprison term with commitment to a mental health facility. See\n\u00a722\u20133430;supra, at 4\u20135. So as noted above, a defendant\narguing moral incapacity may well receive the same treatment in\nKansas as in States that would acquit\u2014and, almost certainly,\ncommit\u2014him for that reason. Seesupra, at 4\u20135. In sum,\nKansas does not bar, but only channels to sentencing, the mental\nhealth evidence that falls outside its intent-based insanity\ndefense. When combined with Kansas\u2019s allowance of mental health\nevidence to show a defendant\u2019s inability to form criminal intent,\nthat sentencing regime defeats Kahler\u2019s charge that the State has\n\u201cabolish[ed] the insanity defense entirely.\u201d[6] Brief for Petitioner 39.So Kahler can prevail here only if he can show\n(again, contraClark) that due process demands a specific\ntest of legal insanity\u2014namely, whether mental illness prevented a\ndefendant from understanding his act as immoral. Kansas, as we have\nexplained, does not use that type of insanity rule. Seesupra, at 3\u20134. If a mentally ill defendant had enough\ncognitive function to form the intent to kill, Kansas law directs a\nconviction even if he believed the murder morally justified. In\nKansas\u2019s judgment, that delusion does not make an intentional\nkiller entirely blameless. See Brief for Respondent 40. Rather than\neliminate, it only lessens the defendant\u2019s moral culpability. Seeibid.And sentencing is the appropriate place to consider\nmitigation: The decisionmaker there can make a nuanced evaluation\nof blame, rather than choose, as a trial jury must, between all and\nnothing. Seeibid.In any event, so Kansas thinks.[7] Those views are contested and\ncontestable; other States\u2014many others\u2014have made a different choice.\nBut Kahler must show more than that. He must show that adopting the\nmoral-incapacity version of the insanity rule is not a choice at\nall\u2014because, again, that version is \u201cso rooted in the traditions\nand conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201dLeland, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 798. And he cannot. The\nhistorical record is, on any fair reading, complex\u2014even messy. As\nwe will detail, it reveals early versions of not only Kahler\u2019s\nproposed standard but also Kansas\u2019s alternative.Early commentators on the common law proposed\nvarious formulations of the insanity defense, with some favoring a\nmorality inquiry and others amens reaapproach. Kahler\ncites William Lambard\u2019s 16th-century treatise defining a \u201cmad man\u201d\nas one who \u201chath no knowledge of good nor evil\u201d (the right and\nwrong of the day). Eirenarcha, ch. 21, p.\u00a0218 (1581). He\nlikewise points to William Hawkins\u2019s statement, over a hundred\nyears later, that a \u201clunatick[\u00a0]\u201d is not punishable because\n\u201cunder a natural disability of distinguishing between good and\nevil.\u201d 1 Pleas of the Crown \u00a71, p.\u00a02 (1716) (capitalization\nomitted). Both true enough. But other early versions of the\ninsanity test\u2014and from a more famous trio of jurists\u2014demanded the\nkind of cognitive impairment that prevented a defendant from\nunderstanding the nature of his acts, and thus intending his crime.\nHenry de Bracton\u2019s 13th-century treatise gave rise to what became\nknown as the \u201cwild beast\u201d test. See J. Biggs, The Guilty Mind 82\n(1955). Used for hundreds of years, it likened a \u201cmadman\u201d to an\n\u201canimal[\u00a0] which lack[s] reason\u201d and so could not have \u201cthe\nintention to injure.\u201d Bracton 384; seeibid.(A \u201cmadman\u201d\ncannot commit a crime because \u201c[i]t is will and purpose which mark\u201d\nmisdeeds). Sir Edward Coke similarly linked the definition of\ninsanity to a defendant\u2019s inability to form criminal intent. He\ndescribed a legally insane person in 1628 as so utterly \u201cwithout\nhis mind or discretion\u201d that he could not have the neededmens\nrea. 2 Coke \u00a7405, at 247b. So too Lord Matthew Hale a century\nlater. He explained that insanity involves \u201ca total alienation of\nthe mind or perfect madness,\u201d such that a defendant could not act\n\u201canimo felonico,\u201d meaning with felonious intent. 1 Pleas of\nthe Crown, ch. 4, pp.\u00a030, 37 (1736); seeid., at 37\n(\u201c[F]or being under a full alienation of mind, he acts not perelectionemorintentionem[by choice or\nintent]\u201d).[8]Quite a few of the old common-law cases\nsimilarly stressed the issue of cognitive capacity. To be sure,\neven these cases included some references to the ability to tell\nright from wrong (and the dissent eagerly cherry-picks every one of\nthem). But the decisions\u2019 overall focus was less on whether a\ndefendant thought his act moral than on whether he had the ability\nto do much thinking at all. In the canonical case ofRexv.Arnold, 16 How. St. Tr. 695 (1724), for example, the jury\ncharge descended straight from Bracton:\u201c[I]t is not every kind of frantic humour\nor something unaccountable in a man\u2019s actions, that points him out\nto be such a madman as is to be exempted from punishment: it must\nbe a man that is totally deprived of his understanding and memory,\nand doth not know what he is doing, no more than an infant, than a\nbrute, or a wild beast.\u201dId., at 764\u2013765.And the court offered an accompanying test\nlinking that lack of reason tomens rea: If a man is\n\u201cdeprived of his reason, and consequently of his intention, he\ncannot be guilty.\u201dId., at 764; seeibid.(defining a\n\u201cmadman\u201d as a \u201cperson that hath no design\u201d); see alsoTrial of\nWilliam Walker(Apr. 21, 1784), in 4 Old Bailey Proceedings\n544, 547 (asking whether the defendant had a \u201cdistemper of mind\nwhich had deprived him of the use of his reason\u201d or instead whether\n\u201che knew what he was doing [and] meant to do it\u201d);Beverley\u2019s\nCase, 4 Co. Rep. 123b, 124b, 76 Eng. Rep. 1118, 1121 (K. B.\n1603) (asking whether a man \u201cis deprived of reason and\nunderstanding\u201d and so \u201ccannot have a felonious intent\u201d). The House\nof Lords used much the same standard inRexv.Lord\nFerrers, 19 How. St. Tr. 886 (1760), when sitting in judgment\non one of its members. There, the Solicitor General told the Lords\nto address \u201cthe capacity and intention of the noble prisoner.\u201dId., at 948. Relying heavily on Hale\u2019s treatise, he defined\nthe legally insane as suffering from an \u201calienation of mind\u201d and a\n\u201ctotal[\u00a0] want of reason.\u201dId., at 947. And in\nrecapping the evidence on that issue, he asked about the\ndefendant\u2019s intention: \u201cDid [Ferrers] proceed with deliberation?\nDid he know the consequences\u201d of his act?Id., at\n948.[9]In such cases, even the language of morality\nmostly worked in service of the emphasis on cognition andmens\nrea. The idea was that if a defendant had such a \u201ctotal[\u00a0]\nwant of reason\u201d as to preclude moral thinking, he could not\npossibly have formed the needed criminal intent.Id., at\n947. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield put the point neatly inBellingham\u2019s Case, 1 G. Collinson, Treatise on the Law\nConcerning Idiots, Lunatics, and Other Persons Non Compotes Mentis\n636 (1812) (Collinson). He instructed the jury:\u201cIf a man were deprived of all power of\nreasoning, so as not to be able to distinguish whether it was right\nor wrong to commit the most wicked transaction, he could not\ncertainly do an act against the law. Such a man, so destitute of\nall power of judgment, could have no intention at all.\u201dId.,\nat 671.On that account, moral incapacity was a\nbyproduct of the kind of cognitive breakdown that precluded findingmens rea, rather than a self-sufficient test of insanity.\nSee alsoRexv.Offord, 5 Car. & P. 168, 169, 172\nEng. Rep. 924, 925 (N. P. 1831) (\u201cexpress[ing] complete accordance\nin the observations of th[e] learned Judge\u201d inBellingham).\nOr said another way, a mentally ill defendant\u2019s inability to\ndistinguish right from wrong, rather than independently producing\nan insanity acquittal, served as a sign\u2014almost a kind of\nevidence\u2014that the defendant lacked the needed criminal intent.Other early common-law cases do not adopt themens reaapproach\u2014but neither can they sustain Kahler\u2019s\nposition. Kahler relies mainly onHadfield\u2019s Case, 27 How.\nSt. Tr. 1281 (1800), to show that common-law courts would acquit a\nmentally ill defendant who understood the nature of his act, but\nbelieved it moral. See Reply Brief 4. There, the defendant had\ndeliberately set out to assassinate King George III on the view\nthat doing so would bring about the Second Coming. See 27 How. St.\nTr., at 1322. The judge instructed the jury that the defendant was\nso \u201cderanged\u201d as to make acquittal appropriate.Id., at\n1353. Maybe, as Kahler argues, that directive stemmed from the\ndefendant\u2019s inability to tell right from wrong. But the judge never\nused that language, or stated any particular legal standard, so it\nis hard to know. Still other judges explained insanity to juries by\nthrowing everything against the wall\u2014mixing notions of cognitive\nincapacity, moral incapacity, and more, without trying to order,\nprioritize, or even distinguish among them. See,e.g.,Reginav.Oxford, 9 Car. & P. 525, 545\u2013548, 173\nEng. Rep. 941, 950 (N. P. 1840);Trial of Francis Parr(Jan.\n15, 1787), in 2 Old Bailey Proceedings 228\u2013229;Bowler\u2019s\nCase, 1 Collinson 674. Those decisions treat the inability to\nmake moral judgments more as part of an all-things-considered\nassessment of legal insanity, and less as its very definition. But\neven if some of them belong in Kahler\u2019s corner, that would be far\nfrom enough. Taken as a whole, the common-law cases reveal no\nsettled consensus favoring Kahler\u2019s preferred insanity rule. And\nwithout that, they cannot support his proposed constitutional\nbaseline.Only withM\u2019Naghten, in 1843, did a court\narticulate, and momentum grow toward accepting, an insanity defense\nbased independently on moral incapacity. SeeClark, 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 749;Leland, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 801;supra, at 2, 8. TheM\u2019Naghtentest, as already\ndescribed, found insanity in either of two circumstances. Seesupra, at 1\u20132. A defendant was acquitted if he \u201clabour[ed]\nunder such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, [1] as not\nto know the nature and quality of the act he was doing;or,\n[2] if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was\nwrong.\u201d 10 Cl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722 (emphasis\nadded). That test disaggregated the concepts of cognitive and moral\nincapacity, so that each served as a stand-alone defense. And its\ncrisp two-part formulation proved influential, not only in Great\nBritain but in the United States too. Over the course of the 19th\ncentury, many States adopted the test, making it the most popular\none in the country.Still,Clarkunhesitatingly declared:\n\u201cHistory shows no deference toM\u2019Naghtenthat could elevate\nits formula to the level of fundamental principle.\u201d 548 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 749. AsClarkelaborated, evenM\u2019Naghtenfailed to\nunify state insanity defenses. See 548 U.\u00a0S., at 749\u2013752.\nStates continued to experiment with insanity rules, reflecting what\none court called \u201cthe infinite variety of forms [of] insanity\u201d and\nthe \u201cdifficult and perplexing\u201d nature of the defense.Robertsv.State, 3 Ga. 310, 328, 332 (1847). Some\nStates in the 1800s gravitated to the newly emergent \u201cvolitional\nincapacity\u201d standard, focusing on whether the defendant could at\nall control his actions.Clark, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 749; see,e.g.,Roberts, 3 Ga., at 331. One court viewed that\ninquiry as \u201cmuch more practical\u201d than the \u201cright and wrong test,\u201d\nwhich it thought often \u201cspeculative and difficult of\ndetermination.\u201dStatev.Felter, 25 Iowa 67, 82, 84\n(1868); seeLeland, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 801 (recognizing such\nskepticism about the moral-incapacity test);supra, at 8\u20139.\nAnother prophesied that the volitional test was the one \u201ctowards\nwhich all the modern authorities in this country[\u00a0] are\ngradually but surely tending.\u201dParsons, 81 Ala., at 586, 2\nSo., at 859. But that test, too, failed to sweep all before it:\nState innovation proceeded apace. See,e.g.,Statev.Pike, 49 N.\u00a0H. 399, 442 (1870) (applying the \u201cproduct\u201d\ntest, which excuses a defendant whose crime \u201cwas the offspring or\nproduct of mental disease\u201d); N.\u00a0D. Cent. Code Ann.\n\u00a712.1\u201304.1\u201301(1)(a) (2012) (replacing the right-from-wrong test\nwith an inquiry into whether the defendant\u2019s act arose from \u201c[a]\nserious distortion of [his] capacity to recognize reality\u201d). Much\nas medical views of mental illness changed as time passed, so too\ndid legal views of how to account for that illness when assigning\nblame.As earlier noted, even the States that adoptedM\u2019Naghtensoon divided on what its second prong should mean.\nSeesupra, at 2\u20133. Most began by asking, as Kahler does,\nabout a defendant\u2019s ability to grasp that his act wasimmoral. See,e.g.,Wrightv.State, 4\nNeb. 407, 409 (1876);Statev.Spencer, 21\nN.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 196, 201 (1846). Thus,ClarklabeledM\u2019Naghten\u2019s second prong a test of \u201cmoral capacity,\u201d and\ninvoked the oft-used phrase \u201ctelling right from wrong\u201d (or in older\nlanguage, good from evil) to describe its central inquiry. 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 747, 753; seesupra, at 2. But over the\nyears, 16 States have reoriented the test to focus on the\ndefendant\u2019s understanding that his act wasillegal\u2014that is,\nlegally rather than morally \u201cwrong.\u201d[10] They thereby excluded from the ranks of the insane\nthose who knew an act was criminal but still thought it right.Contrary to Kahler\u2019s (and the dissent\u2019s)\ncontention, that difference matters. See Reply Brief 7 (claiming\nthat \u201cthere is little daylight between these inquiries\u201d);post, at 17, 21 (same). The two tests will treat some, even\nthough not all, defendants in opposite ways. And the defendants\nthey will treat differently are exactly those Kahler (and the\ndissent) focus on: those who know exactly what they are doing\n(including that it is against the law) but believe it morally\njustified\u2014because, say, it is commanded by God (or in the dissent\u2019s\ncase, a dog). See Brief for Petitioner 15;post, at 20;Schmidt, 216 N.\u00a0Y., at 339, 110 N.\u00a0E., at\n949.[11] A famed theorist of\ncriminal law put the point this way:\u201cA kills B knowing that he is killing B,\nand knowing that it is illegal to kill B, but under an insane\ndelusion that the salvation of the human race will be obtained by\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the murder of B[.] A\u2019s act is a crime if the word\n\u2018wrong\u2019 [inM\u2019Naghten] means illegal. It is not a crime if\nthe word wrong means morally wrong.\u201d 2 J. Stephen, History of the\nCriminal Law of England, ch. 19, p.\u00a0149 (1883).So constitutionalizing the moral-incapacity\nstandard, as Kahler requests, would require striking down not only\nthe five state laws like Kansas\u2019s (as the dissent at times\nsuggests, seepost, at 16), but 16 others as well (as the\ndissent eventually concedes is at least possible, seepost,\nat 21). And with what justification? The emergence ofM\u2019Naghten\u2019s legal variant, far from raising a due process\nproblem, merely confirms whatClarkalready recognized. Even\nafter its articulation inM\u2019Naghten(much less before), the\nmoral-incapacity test has never commanded the day.Clark,\n548 U.\u00a0S., at 749.[12]Indeed, just decades ago Congress gave serious\nconsideration to adopting amens reaapproach like Kansas\u2019s\nas the federal insanity rule. SeeUnited Statesv.Pohlot, 827 F.2d 889, 899, and n.\u00a09 (CA3 1987)\n(describing bipartisan support for that proposal). The Department\nof Justice at the time favored that version of the insanity test.\nPerhaps more surprisingly, the American Medical Association did\ntoo. And the American Psychiatric Association took no position one\nway or the other. Although Congress chose in the end to adhere to\ntheM\u2019Naghtenrule, the debate over the bill itself reveals\ncontinuing division over the proper scope of the insanity\ndefense.Nor is that surprising, given the nature of the\ninquiry. As the American Psychiatric Association once noted,\n\u201cinsanity is a matter of some uncertainty.\u201d Insanity Defense Work\nGroup, Statement on the Insanity Defense, 140 Am. J. Psych. 681,\n685 (1983). Across both time and place, doctors and scientists have\nheld many competing ideas about mental illness. And that is only\nthe half of it. Formulating an insanity defense also involves\nchoosing among theories of moral and legal culpability, themselves\nthe subject of recurrent controversy. At the juncture between those\ntwo spheres of conflict and change, small wonder there has not been\nthe stasis Kahler sees\u2014with one version of the insanity defense\nentrenched for hundreds of years.And it is not for the courts to insist on any\nsingle criterion going forward. We have made the point before, inLeland,Powell, andClark. Seesupra,\nat 7\u20139. Just a brief reminder: \u201c[F]ormulating a constitutional rule\nwould reduce, if not eliminate, [the States\u2019] fruitful\nexperimentation, and freeze the developing productive dialogue\nbetween law and psychiatry into a rigid constitutional mold.\u201dPowell, 392 U.\u00a0S., at 536\u2013537. Or again: In a sphere of\n\u201cflux and disagreement,\u201d with \u201cfodder for reasonable debate about\nwhat the cognate legal and medical tests should be,\u201d due process\nimposes no one view of legal insanity.Clark, 548\nU.\u00a0S., at 752\u2013753. Defining the precise relationship between\ncriminal culpability and mental illness involves examining the\nworkings of the brain, the purposes of the criminal law, the ideas\nof free will and responsibility. It is a project demanding hard\nchoices among values, in a context replete with uncertainty, even\nat a single moment in time. And it is a project, if any is, that\nshould be open to revision over time, as new medical knowledge\nemerges and as legal and moral norms evolve. Which is all to say\nthat it is a project for state governance, not constitutional\nlaw.We therefore decline to require that Kansas\nadopt an insanity test turning on a defendant\u2019s ability to\nrecognize that his crime was morally wrong. Contrary to Kahler\u2019s\nview, Kansas takes account of mental health at both trial and\nsentencing. It has just not adopted the particular insanity defense\nKahler would like. That choice is for Kansas to make\u2014and, if it\nwishes, to remake and remake again as the future unfolds. No\ninsanity rule in this country\u2019s heritage or history was ever so\nsettled as to tie a State\u2019s hands centuries later. For that reason,\nwe affirm the judgment below.It is so ordered.Notes1Another complicating\nfactor inClark\u2019s classification scheme is that States\n\u201climit, in varying degrees, which sorts of mental illness\u201d can\nsupport an insanity claim.Clarkv.Arizona,548 U.S.\n735, 750, n.\u00a011 (2006). So even two States using the same\ntest for judging culpability may apply it to differently sized sets\nof offenders. Seeinfra, at 21, n.\u00a011.2At the time of the crime\nin this case, a materially identical provision was codified at\n\u00a722\u20133220 (2007).3Four other States\nsimilarly exonerate a mentally ill defendant only when he cannot\nunderstand the nature of his actions and so cannot form the\nrequisitemens rea. See Alaska Stat. \u00a7\u00a712.47.010(a),\n12.47.020 (2018); Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a718\u2013207(1), (3) (2016); Mont.\nCode Ann. \u00a746\u201314\u2013102 (2019); Utah Code \u00a776\u20132\u2013305\n(2017).4Kahler also asked us to\ndecide whether the Eighth Amendment requires that States make\navailable the moral-incapacity defense. See Pet. for Cert. 18. But\nthat claim is not properly before us. Kahler did not raise the\nargument below, and the Kansas courts therefore did not address\nit.5Although the dissent at\ntimes claims to the contrary, its argument is the same. Given the\nclear direction of our precedent, the dissent must purport to grant\nthe States \u201cleeway\u201d in defining legal insanity.Post, at 1.\nBut the entirety of the dissent\u2019s historical analysis focuses on\nthe moral-incapacity standard\u2014attempting to show, just as Kahler\ndoes, that it both preceded and succeededM\u2019Naghten. Seepost, at 4\u201317. And in line with that narration, the dissent\ninsists on moral understanding as the indispensable criterion of\nlegal sanity\u2014thesine qua nonof criminal responsibility.\nSee,e.g.,post, at 1, 3\u20134, 8\u20139, 18\u201321. Indeed, the\ndissent offers only one way the States have actual \u201cleeway\u201d to\nchange their insanity rules: They can \u201cexpanduponM\u2019Naghten\u2019s principles\u201d by finding that even some whohavemoral capacity are insane.Post, at 22. But that\nis just to say that moral capacity is the constitutional\nfloor\u2014again, exactly what Kahler argues.6We here conclude only\nthat Kansas\u2019s scheme does not abolish the insanity defense. We say\nnothing, one way or the other, about whether any other scheme might\ndo so.7The dissent is therefore\nwrong to suggest that Kansas\u2019s law has become untethered from moral\njudgments about culpability. Seepost, at 1, 3, 16\u201322. No\ndoubt, Kansas\u2019s moral judgments differ from the dissent\u2019s. Again,\nKansas believes that an intentional killer is not wholly blameless,\neven if, for example, he thought his actions commanded by God. The\ndissent, in contrast, considers Kansas\u2019s view benighted (as maybe\nsome in the majority do too). But that is not a dispute, as the\ndissent suggests, aboutwhethermorality should play a role\nin assigning legal responsibility. It is instead a disagreement\nabout what morality entails\u2014that is, aboutwhena defendant\nis morally culpable for an act like murder. SeeStatev.Bethel, 275 Kan. 456, 465\u2013471, 66 P.3d 840, 847\u2013850 (2003)\n(accepting Kansas\u2019s view that \u201cmoral blameworthiness\u201d is linked to\na defendant\u2019s intent to kill, rather than to his ability to tell\nright from wrong). And we have made clear, fromLelandtoPowelltoClark, that courts do not get to make such\njudgments. Seesupra, at 7\u20139. Instead, the States have broad\ndiscretion to decide who counts as blameworthy, and to weigh that\nalong with other factors in defining the elements of, and defenses\nto, crimes.8The dissent tries to\nrecruit these three jurists to the side of the moral-incapacity\ntest, seepost, at 5\u20137, but cannot succeed. Even the\ncarefully curated passages the dissent quotes focus on cognitive\ncapability rather than moral judgment. See,e.g.,post, at 5\u20136 (asking whether a defendant had \u201csense and\nreason\u201d or \u201cunderstanding and liberty of will\u201d). In so doing, they\nrefer to the defendant\u2019s ability to form the requisitemens\nrea, or felonious intent. SeeClark, 548 U.\u00a0S., at\n747;supra, at 1\u20133. The dissent still insists all is not\nlost because (it says)mens reaitself hinged at common law\non a defendant\u2019s \u201cmoral understanding.\u201dPost, at 8\u20139. Here,\nthe dissent infers from the use of \u201cgood-from-evil\u201d language in\nvarious common-law treatises and cases that moral blameworthiness\nmust have defined themens reainquiry. Seeibid.But\nto begin with\u2014and to repeat the point made in the text\u2014the most\ninfluential treatises used little of that language, emphasizing\ninstead the need for a defendant to intend his act in the ordinary\nsense of the term. And as we will explain, the joint presence of\nreferences tomens reaand moral understanding in other\ncommon-law sources involving insanity does not show that most\njurists saw the two concepts as one and the same. Seeinfra,\nat 16\u201319. Some may well have viewedmens reathrough a moral\nprism; but others emphasized cognitive understanding in using that\nterm; and still others combined the moral and cognitive in diverse\nways. Which is to say that the record is far more complicated than\nthe dissent lets on, with jurists invoking, both within particular\nsources and across all of them, a variety of ways to resolve\ninsanity claims. And under our long-established precedent, that\nmotley sort of history cannot provide the basis for a successful\ndue process claim.9Even in the face of these\ninstructions, the dissent claims thatArnoldandFerrersactually used the moral-incapacity test. Seepost, at 9\u201311. The assertion is based on some \u201cgood and\nevil\u201d language (inFerrers, mostly from witnesses) appearing\nin the case reports. But scholars generally agree, in line with our\nview, thatArnoldandFerrers\u201cdemonstrate how\nstrictly\u201d courts viewed \u201cthe criteria of insanity.\u201d 1 N. Walker,\nCrime and Insanity in England 53 (1968) (noting that the two\ndecisions \u201chave often been cited\u201d for that proposition). Kahler\nhimself does not dispute the point; indeed, he essentially concedes\nour reading. Rather than try to make the decisions say something\nthey do not, he argues only that they were \u201coutlier[s]\u201d and \u201ccould\nhardly have been less typical.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 22, n.\u00a05;\nReply Brief 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that\ncontrasting response fares no better. As even the dissent agrees,\nthese were the \u201cseminal\u201d common-law decisions relating to\ninsanity\u2014indeed, two of only a small number in that period to make\nit into official reports.Post, at 9.10SeeStatev.Skaggs, 120 Ariz. 467, 472,586 P.2d 1279, 1284 (1978);Wallacev.State, 766\nSo. 2d 364, 367 (Fla.

Consider a\ncase, Judge Cardozo said: \u201cA mother kills her infant child to whom\nshe has been devotedly attached. She knows the nature and quality\nof the act; she knows that the law condemns it; but she is inspired\nby an insane delusion that God has appeared to her and ordained the\nsacrifice.\u201dPeoplev.Schmidt, 216 N.Y. 324, 339, 110\nN.E. 945, 949 (1915). If the legal wrong test were used, Judge\nCardozo continued, \u201cit would be the duty of a jury to hold her\nresponsible for the crime.\u201dIbid.But not if the focus was,\nas in the originalM\u2019Naghtentest, on moral wrong. And that\ndifference led the New York Court of Appeals to hold that the trial\ncourt\u2019s jury instruction was in error. See 216 N.\u00a0Y., at 340,\n110 N.\u00a0E., at 950. The additional cases the dissent cites to\ndownplay the distinction between moral and legal wrong in fact\nfollowSchmidtin recognizing when they diverge. SeeWorlock, 117 N.\u00a0J., at 611, 569 A.\u00a02d, at 1322\n(explaining that \u201cthe distinction between moral and legal wrong may\nbe critical\u201d when, for example, a defendant \u201cknowingly kill[s]\nanother in obedience to a command from God\u201d);Crenshaw, 98\nWash. 2d, at 798, 659 P.\u00a02d, at 494 (acknowledgingSchmidt\u2019s view that even when a defendant \u201cknows that the\nlaw and society condemn [her] act,\u201d she should not be held\nresponsible if \u201cher free will has been subsumed by her belief in\n[a] deific decree\u201d).12The\ndiversity of American approaches to insanity is also evident in the\nStates\u2019 decisions about which kinds of mental illness can support\nthe defense. SeeClark, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 750, n.\u00a011;supra, at 3, n.\u00a01. Some States limit the defense to\nthose with a \u201csevere\u201d mental disease. See,e.g., Ala. Code\n\u00a713A\u20133\u20131 (2015). Others prohibit its assertion by defendants with\nspecific mental disorders. See,e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u2013502 (2010) (\u201cpsychosexual\u201d or \u201cimpulse control disorders\u201d);\nOre. Rev. Stat. \u00a7161.295(2) (\u201cpersonality disorders\u201d). In\nparticular, many States follow the Model Penal Code in prohibiting\npsychopaths from raising the defense. See ALI, Model Penal Code\n\u00a74.01(2), p.\u00a0163 (1985);e.g., Ind. Code \u00a735\u201341\u20133\u20136(b)\n(2019) (\u201cabnormality manifested only by repeated unlawful or\notherwise antisocial conduct\u201d). All those limitations apply even\nwhen the defendant\u2019s mental illness prevented him from recognizing\nthat his crime was immoral. In that way too, many States have\ndeparted from the principle that Kahler (along with the dissent)\nclaims the Constitution commands.",
