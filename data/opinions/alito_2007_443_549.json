S. ____ (2007)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 05-1429TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA,\nPETITIONERv.PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANYon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[March 20, 2007]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.We are asked to consider whether\nfederal bankruptcy law precludes an unsecured creditor from\nrecovering attorney\u2019s fees authorized by a prepetition contract and\nincurred in postpetition litigation. The Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit held, based on a rule previously adopted by that\ncourt, that such fees are categorically prohibited\u2014even where the\ncontractual allocation of attorney\u2019s fees would be enforceable\nunder applicable nonbankruptcy law\u2014to the extent the litigation\ninvolves issues of federal bankruptcy law. Because that rule finds\nno support in the Bankruptcy Code, we vacate and remand.IRespondent Pacific Gas and\nElectric Company (PG&E) filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy\npetition in April 2001, 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101et seq.,\nand continued thereafter to operate its business as a \u201cdebtor in\npossession.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71107(a), 1108. The bankruptcy filing caught the\nattention of petitioner Travelers Casualty & Surety Company\n(Travelers), which had previously issued a $100 million surety bond\non PG&E\u2019s behalf to the California Department of Industrial\nRelations, guaranteeing PG&E\u2019s payment of state workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits to injured employees.[Footnote 1] In connection with the bond, PG&E\nexecuted a series of indemnity agreements in favor of Travelers.\nThe indemnity agreements provide that PG&E will be responsible\nfor any loss Travelers might incur in connection with the bonds,\nincluding any attorney\u2019s fees incurred in pursuing, protecting, or\nlitigating Travelers\u2019 rights in connection with those bonds.Although no default occurred,\nTravelers asserted a claim in the bankruptcy action to protect\nitself in case PG&E defaulted on its workers\u2019 compensation\nbenefits at some point in the future, requiring Travelers to make\npayments under its bond. In response to Travelers\u2019 claim, and with\nthe knowledge and approval of the Bankruptcy Court, PG&E agreed\nto insert language into its reorganization plan and disclosure\nstatement to protect Travelers\u2019 right to indemnity and subrogation\nin the event of a default by PG&E.Travelers claims, however, that PG&E then\nunilaterally altered the negotiated language in a way that\nsubstantially diminished the protection it had been seeking.\nAccording to Travelers, that development resulted in additional\nlitigation, but Travelers and PG&E ultimately resolved the\ndispute by entering into a stipulation that was later approved by\nthe Bankruptcy Court. In addition to accommodating Travelers\u2019\nsubstantive concerns, the stipulation stated that Travelers \u201cmay\nassert its claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under the [i]ndemnity\n[a]greements\u201d (subject to PG&E\u2019s right to object) as a general\nunsecured claim against PG&E. Brief for Petitioner 17.Travelers subsequently filed an amended proof\nof claim seeking to recover the attorney\u2019s fees it incurred in\nconnection with PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. PG&E\nobjected, arguing that Travelers could not recover attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law.The Bankruptcy Court agreed and rejected\nTravelers\u2019 claim on that basis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\u201325a.\nTravelers appealed that ruling to the District Court. The District\nCourt affirmed, relying onIn\u00a0re Fobian, 951\nF.\u00a02d 1149 (CA9 1991), which held that \u201cwhere the litigated\nissues involve not basic contract enforcement questions, but issues\npeculiar to federal bankruptcy law, attorney\u2019s fees will not be\nawarded absent bad faith or harassment by the losing party,\u201did., at 1153. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a, 17a.Travelers appealed again, and the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 167 Fed.\nAppx. 593 (2006). The panel acknowledged that, in at least some\ncircumstances, a \u201c\u00a0\u2018prevailing party in a bankruptcy\nproceeding may be entitled to an award of attorney fees in\naccordance with applicable state law . . . .\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,\nat 594 (quotingIn\u00a0re Baroff, 105 F.\u00a03d 439, 441\n(CA9 1997)). The panel nevertheless rejected Travelers\u2019 claim based\non theFobianrule, which it cited for the proposition\nthat \u201cattorney fees are not recoverable in bankruptcy for\nlitigating issues \u2018peculiar to federal bankruptcy law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 167\nFed. Appx., at 594 (quotingFobian,supra, at\n1153). The panel explained that, because the fees claimed by\nTravelers were incurred litigating issues that were \u201cgoverned\nentirely by federal bankruptcy law,\u201d Travelers\u2019 claim necessarily\nfailed.[Footnote 2] 167 Fed.\nAppx., at 594.Travelers sought review in this Court, noting\na conflict among the Courts of Appeals regarding the validity of\ntheFobianrule. CompareFobian,supra,\nat 1153, withIn\u00a0re Shangra-La,Inc.,167 F.\u00a03d 843, 848\u2013849 (CA4 1999). We\ngranted certiorari to resolve that conflict, 549 U. S. ___\n(2006).IIUnder the American Rule, \u201cthe\nprevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fee from the loser.\u201dAlyeska Pipeline\nService Co.v.Wilderness Society,421 U. S. 240, 247\n(1975); seeHauensteinv.Lynham,100 U. S. 483, 490\u2013491\n(1880);Arcambelv.Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306 (1796).\nThis default rule can, of course, be overcome by statute.Fleischmann Distilling Corp.v.Maier Brewing\nCo.,386 U. S.\n714, 717 (1967). It can also be overcome by an \u201cenforceable\ncontract\u201d allocating attorney\u2019s fees.Ibid.In a case governed by the\nBankruptcy Act of 1898, we observed that \u201c[t]he character of [a\ncontractual] obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees presents no obstacle\nto enforcing it in bankruptcy, either as a provable claim or by way\nof a lien upon specific property.\u201dSecurity Mortgage Co.v.Powers,278 U. S. 149, 154\n(1928). Similarly, under the terms of the current Bankruptcy Code,\nit remains true that an otherwise enforceable contract allocating\nattorney\u2019s fees (i.e., one that is enforceable under\nsubstantive, nonbankruptcy law) is allowable in bankruptcy except\nwhere the Bankruptcy Code provides otherwise. See 4 Collier on\nBankruptcy \u00b6 506.04[3][a], p. 506\u2013118 (rev. 15th ed. 2006)\n(hereinafter Collier).This case requires us to consider whether the\nBankruptcy Code disallows contract-based claims for attorney\u2019s fees\nbased solely on the fact that the fees at issue were incurred\nlitigating issues of bankruptcy law. We conclude that it does\nnot.AWhen a debtor declares\nbankruptcy, each of its creditors is entitled to file a proof of\nclaim\u2014i.e., a document providing proof of a \u201cright to\npayment,\u201d 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(5)(A)\u2014against the debtor\u2019s estate.\nOnce a proof of claim has been filed, the court must determine\nwhether the claim is \u201callowed\u201d under \u00a7502(a) of the Bankruptcy\nCode: \u201cA claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section\n501 . . . is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest . . .\nobjects.\u201dBut even where a party in\ninterest objects, the court \u201cshall allow\u201d the claim \u201cexcept to the\nextent that\u201d the claim implicates any of the nine exceptions\nenumerated in \u00a7502(b).Ibid. Those exceptions apply where\nthe claim at issue is \u201cunenforceable against the debtor \u2026 under any\nagreement or applicable law,\u201d \u00a7502(b)(1); \u201cis for unmatured\ninterest,\u201d \u00a7502(b)(2); \u201cis for [property tax that] exceeds the\nvalue of the [estate\u2019s] interest\u201d in the property, \u00a7502(b)(3); \u201cis\nfor services of an insider or attorney of the debtor\u201d and \u201cexceeds\nthe reasonable value of such services,\u201d \u00a7502(b)(4); is for\nunmatured debt on certain alimony and child support obligations,\n\u00a7502(b)(5); is for certain \u201cdamages resulting from the termination\u201d\nof a lease or employment contract, \u00a7\u00a7502(b)(6) and (7); \u201cresults\nfrom a reduction, due to late payment, in the amount of \u2026 credit\navailable to the debtor in connection with an employment tax on\nwages, salaries, or commissions earned from the debtor,\u201d\n\u00a7502(b)(8); or was brought to the court\u2019s attention through an\nuntimely proof of claim, \u00a7502(b)(9).Travelers\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees has\nnothing to do with property tax, child support or alimony, services\nprovided by an attorney of the debtor, damages resulting from the\ntermination of a lease or employment contract, or the late payment\nof any employment tax. See \u00a7\u00a7502(b)(2)\u2013(8). Nor does it appear that\nthe proof of claim was untimely. See \u00a7502(b)(9). Thus, Travelers\u2019\nclaim must be allowed under \u00a7502(b) unless it is unenforceable\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7502(b)(1).BSection 502(b)(1) disallows any\nclaim that is \u201cunenforceable against the debtor and property of the\ndebtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other\nthan because such claim is contingent or unmatured.\u201d This provision\nis most naturally understood to provide that, with limited\nexceptions, any defense to a claim that is available outside of the\nbankruptcy context is also available in bankruptcy. See 4 Collier\n\u00b6\u00a0502.03[2][b], at 502\u201322 (explaining that \u00a7502(b)(1) is\ngenerally understood to \u201cmake available to the trustee any defense\u201d\navailable to the debtor \u201cunder applicable nonbankruptcy\nlaw\u201d\u2014i.e., any defense that the debtor \u201ccould have\ninterposed, absent bankruptcy, in a suit on the [same substantive]\nclaim by the creditor\u201d).This reading of \u00a7502(b)(1) is\nconsistent not only with the plain statutory text, but also with\nthe settled principle that \u201c[c]reditors\u2019 entitlements in bankruptcy\narise in the first instance from the underlying substantive law\ncreating the debtor\u2019s obligation, subject to any qualifying or\ncontrary provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201dRaleighv.Illinois Dept. of Revenue,530 U. S. 15, 20 (2000).\nThat principle requires bankruptcy courts to consult state law in\ndetermining the validity of most claims. Seeibid.Indeed, we have long recognized that the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018basic federal rule\u2019 in bankruptcy is that state law governs\nthe substance of claims, Congress having \u2018generally left the\ndetermination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt\u2019s\nestate to state law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quotingButnerv.United States,440 U. S. 48, 57, 54\n(1979); citation omitted). Accordingly, when the Bankruptcy Code\nuses the word \u201cclaim\u201d\u2014which the Code itself defines as a \u201cright to\npayment,\u201d 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(5)(A)\u2014it is usually referring to a\nright to payment recognized under state law. As we stated inButner, \u201c[p]roperty interests are created and defined by\nstate law,\u201d and \u201c[u]nless some federal interest requires a\ndifferent result, there is no reason why such interests should be\nanalyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved\nin a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d 440 U. S., at 55; accord,Vanston\nBondholders Protective Comm.v.Green,329 U. S. 156, 161\n(1946) (\u201cWhat claims of creditors are valid and subsisting\nobligations against the bankrupt at the time a petition in\nbankruptcy is filed is a question which, in the absence of\noverruling federal law, is to be determined by reference to state\nlaw\u201d).CIn rejecting Travelers\u2019 claim for\ncontractual attorney\u2019s fees, the Court of Appeals did not conclude\nthat the claim was \u201cunenforceable\u201d under \u00a7502(b)(1) as a matter of\napplicable nonbankruptcy law. Nor did it conclude that Travelers\u2019\nclaim was rendered unenforceable by any provision of the Bankruptcy\nCode. To the contrary, the court acknowledged that, in at least\nsome circumstances, a \u201c\u00a0\u2018prevailing party in a bankruptcy\nproceeding may be entitled to an award of attorney fees in\naccordance with applicable state law . . . .\u2019\u00a0\u201d 167 Fed.\nAppx., at 594 (quotingBaroff, 105 F.\u00a03d, at\n441).The court nevertheless rejected\nTravelers\u2019 claim based solely on a rule of that court\u2019s own\ncreation\u2014the so-calledFobianrule\u2014which dictates that\n\u201cattorney fees are not recoverable in bankruptcy for litigating\nissues \u2018peculiar to federal bankruptcy law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 167 Fed. Appx.,\nat 594 (quotingFobian, 951 F.\u00a02d, at 1153). The\ncourt explained that, because the fees claimed by Travelers were\nincurred litigating issues that were \u201cgoverned entirely by federal\nbankruptcy law,\u201d 167 Fed. Appx., at 594, Travelers\u2019 claim\nnecessarily failed.TheFobianrule finds no support in\nthe Bankruptcy Code, either in \u00a7502 or elsewhere. InFobian, the court did not identify any provision of the\nBankruptcy Code as providing support for the new rule. See 951\nF.\u00a02d, at 1153. Instead, the court cited three of its own\nprior decisions,In\u00a0re Johnson, 756 F.\u00a02d 738\n(1985);In\u00a0re Coast Trading Co., 744 F.\u00a02d 686\n(1984); andIn\u00a0re Fulwiler, 624 F.\u00a02d 908 (1980)(per curium). Significantly, in none of those cases did\nthe court identify any basis for disallowing a contractual claim\nfor attorney\u2019s fees incurred litigating issues of federal\nbankruptcy law. Nor did the court have occasion to do so; in each\nof those cases, the claim for attorney\u2019s fees failed as a matter of\nstate law. SeeJohnson,supra, at 741\u2013742;Coast Trading,supra, at 693;Fulwiler,supra, at 910.[Footnote\n3]The absence of textual support is fatal for\ntheFobianrule. Consistent with our prior statements\nregarding creditors\u2019 entitlements in bankruptcy, see,e.g.,Raleigh, 530 U. S., at 20, we generally\npresume that claims enforceable under applicable state law will be\nallowed in bankruptcy unless they are expressly disallowed. See 11\nU. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7502(b). Neither the court below nor PG&E has\noffered any reason why the fact that the attorney\u2019s fees in this\ncase were incurred litigating issues of federal bankruptcy law\novercomes that presumption.Section 502(b)(4) is instructive on this\npoint. That provision expressly disallows claims for a particular\ncategory of attorney\u2019s fees\u2014those \u201cfor services of an \u2026 attorney of\nthe debtor,\u201d to the extent the claimed fees \u201cexcee[d] the\nreasonable value of such services.\u201d The existence of that provision\nsuggests that, in its absence, a claim for such fees would be\nallowed in bankruptcy to the extent enforceable under state law.\nThe absence of an analogous provision excluding the category of\nfees covered by theFobianrule likewise suggests that the\nCode does not categorically disallow them. See 4 Collier \u00b6\n506.04[3][a], at 506\u2013118 (concluding thatFobian\u201cinverts\nthe proper analysis\u201d by allowing attorney\u2019s fees only where they\nare expressly authorized by the Bankruptcy Code, and explaining\nthat \u201ca claim for attorney\u2019s fees arising in the context of\nlitigating bankruptcy issues must be allowed if valid under\napplicable state law\u201d).Congress, of course, has the power to amend\nthe Bankruptcy Code by adding a provision expressly disallowing\nclaims for attorney\u2019s fees incurred by creditors in the litigation\nof bankruptcy issues. But because no such provision exists, the\nBankruptcy Code provides no basis for disallowing Travelers\u2019 claim\non the grounds stated by the Ninth Circuit.As we explained inFCCv.NextWave Personal Communications Inc.,537 U. S. 293(2003),\n\u201cwhere Congress has intended to provide . . . exceptions to\nprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code, it has done so clearly and\nexpressly.\u201dId., at 302. Here, the Bankruptcy Code does\nnot \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d compel courts to follow theFobianrule; on the contrary, the Code saysnothingabout unsecured claims for contractual attorney\u2019s\nfees incurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law. In light\nof the broad, permissive scope of \u00a7502(b)(1), and our prior\nrecognition that \u201cthe character of [a contractual] obligation to\npay attorney\u2019s fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in\nbankruptcy,\u201d it necessarily follows that theFobianrule\ncannot stand.Security Mortgage, 278 U. S., at 154; seeCohenv.de la Cruz,523 U. S. 213, 221\n(1998) (\u201cWe . . . \u2018will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past\nbankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingPennsylvania Dept.\nof Public Welfarev.Davenport,495 U. S. 552, 563\n(1990))).IIIPG&E makes no effort to\ndefend theFobianrule. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28 (conceding\nthat PG&E does not defend theFobianrule, and\nacknowledging that \u201c[t]he Fobian rule is wrong . . . as to the\ndistinction that it draws between State law and Federal\nlitigation\u201d). Instead, PG&E argues that \u00a7506(b) categorically\ndisallows unsecured claims for contractual attorney\u2019s fees\nand\u2014noting that Travelers\u2019 claim is unsecured\u2014asks us to affirm on\nthat basis. Section 506(b) provides as follows:\u201cTo the extent that an allowed secured claim is\nsecured by property the value of which \u2026 is greater than the amount\nof such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim,\ninterest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges\nprovided for under the agreement or State statute under which such\nclaim arose.\u201d 11 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a7506(b) (Supp. 2006).According to PG&E, this provision authorizes\nclaims for contractual attorney\u2019s fees to the extent the creditor\nis oversecured, but disallows such claims to the extent the\ncreditor is either not oversecured or (like Travelers) completely\nunsecured. This reading of the Code, PG&E argues, \u201cis not a\nmatter of negative implication, but of explicit negation.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 18. PG&E also argues that the structure and\npurpose of the Bankruptcy Code, examined against the backdrop of\npre-Code bankruptcy law, confirm that Congress did not intend to\nallow unsecured creditors to recover attorney\u2019s fees. Seeid., at 25\u201338.PG&E did not raise these arguments below.\nConsequently, none of the lower courts had occasion to address\nthem. Nor were these arguments presented in PG&E\u2019s brief in\nopposition to certiorari. PG&E nevertheless insists that we\nshould address these arguments as though they were \u201cfairly\nincluded\u201d within the question presented in Travelers\u2019 petition for\ncertiorari. Seeid., at 41. That contention appears to be\npremised on the theory that \u201cthe Fobian rule reaches the correct\nconclusion in this case,\u201d but \u201cdoesn\u2019t go far enough in \u2026\npreventing creditors from requiring other creditors to pay for\ntheir attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.We are not persuaded. We granted certiorari to\nresolve a conflict among the lower courts regarding theFobianrule, which is analytically distinct from, and\nfundamentally at odds with, PG&E\u2019s reading of \u00a7506(b).[Footnote 4]In any event, we ordinarily do not consider\nclaims that were neither raised nor addressed below,Cooper\nIndustries, Inc.v.Aviall Services, Inc.,543 U. S. 157, 168\u2013169\n(2004), and PG&E has failed to identify any circumstances that\nwould warrant an exception to that rule in this case. We therefore\nwill not consider these arguments.[Footnote 5]Accordingly, we express no opinion with regard\nto whether, following the demise of theFobianrule, other\nprinciples of bankruptcy law might provide an independent basis for\ndisallowing Travelers\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude only\nthat the Court of Appeals erred in disallowing that claim based on\nthe fact that the fees at issue were incurred litigating issues of\nbankruptcy law.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1California law required PG&E to provide\nworkers\u2019 compensation benefits for its employees by either (1)\npurchasing workers\u2019 compensation insurance from a licensed provider\nof such insurance or (2) adopting a plan, with the State\u2019s\napproval, to self-insure. PG&E chose the latter option, and was\ntherefore required to post security with the State to ensure\nongoing payment of mandatory workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See\nCal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a73700, 3701 (West 2003). Travelers posted the\nrequired security by issuing a bond on PG&E\u2019s behalf. The bond\nmakes Travelers liable, up to $100 million, for workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits in the event of a default by PG&E.Footnote 2The Court of Appeals incorporated by\nreference the reasoning employed inIn\u00a0re DeRoche,\n434 F.\u00a03d 1188 (CA9 2006), which was decided by the same panel\nthat decided this case. 167 Fed. Appx., at 593. Although theDeRocheopinion is longer than its counterpart in this\ncase, it adds very little to the panel\u2019s explanation of theFobianrule. SeeDeRoche,supra, at\n1190\u20131192.Footnote 3InJohnson, the debtor sought\nattorney\u2019s fees after the creditor unsuccessfully requested relief\nfrom the automatic stay under 11 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7362(d)(1). The\ndebtor acknowledged that the contract between the parties entitled\nonly the creditor to attorney\u2019s fees, but the debtor claimed that a\nCalifornia statute extended that entitlement to both parties. The\ncourt rejected that argument, noting that the statute applied only\nin the context of an \u201c\u00a0\u2018action on a contract,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\nconcluding that a request for relief from an automatic stay could\nnot be considered an action on a contract. 756 F.\u00a02d, at\n741\u2013742. BothCoast TradingandFulwilerinvolved\nclaims for attorney\u2019s fees based on an Oregon statute similar to\nthe statute at issue inJohnson;the court found the\nstatute inapplicable in both cases.Coast Trading, 744\nF.\u00a02d, at 693;Fulwiler, 624 F.\u00a02d, at\n909\u2013910.Footnote 4PG&E\u2019s new reading of the Code would\nprohibitallunsecured creditors from recovering\ncontractual, postpetition attorney\u2019s fees in bankruptcy\nproceedings\u2014even if those fees were incurred while litigating\nissues of state law. See Brief for Respondent 17\u201319. TheFobianrule, by contrast, would allow such a recovery\u2014even\nby unsecured creditors\u2014so long as the litigation resulting in the\nclaimed fees did not involve \u201cissues peculiar to federal bankruptcy\nlaw.\u201d SeeIn\u00a0re Fobian,951 F.\u00a02d 1149, 1153\n(CA9 1991).Footnote 5For similar reasons, we will not address\nPG&E\u2019s argument that Travelers\u2019 claim should be denied based on\nthe theory that the fees at issue were incurred in connection with\nactivities that were not reasonably necessary to preserve\nTravelers\u2019 rights and, alternatively, were not authorized by\nTravelers\u2019 contract with PG&E. See Brief for Respondent 42\u201349.\nThis argument was not addressed below, was not raised in PG&E\u2019s\nbrief in opposition to certiorari, and bears no relation to the\nquestion presented. See this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a) (\u201cOnly the\nquestions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will\nbe considered by the Court\u201d).",
