An\nexception exists, however, for disclosures that are \u201cspecifically\nprohibited by law.\u201dIbid.Here, a federal air marshal\npublicly disclosed that the Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA) had de-cided to cut costs by removing air marshals from\ncertain long-distance flights. The question presented is whether\nthat disclosure was \u201cspecifically prohibited by law.\u201dIAIn 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security\nAct,116Stat.2135. As relevant here, that Act provides that the TSA\n\u201cshall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of\ninformation obtained or developed in carrying out security\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the\ninformation would .\u00a0.\u00a0. be detrimental to the security of\ntransportation.\u201d49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7114(r)(1)(C).Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regulations\nprohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it called\n\u201csensitive security information.\u201d See 67 Fed. Reg. 8351 (2002). The\nregulations described 18 categories of sensitive security\ninformation, including \u201c[s]pecific details of aviation security\nmeasures .\u00a0.\u00a0. [such as] information concerning specific\nnumbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the\nmethods involved in such operations.\u201d 49 CFR \u00a71520.7(j) (2002).\nSensitive security information is not classified, so the TSA can\nshare it with individuals who do not have a security clearance,\nsuch as airport employees. Compare Exec. Order 13526, \u00a74.1, 3 CFR\n298, 314\u2013315 (2009 Comp.), with 49 CFR \u00a71520.11(c) (2013).BRobert J. MacLean became a federal air marshal for the TSA in\n2001. In that role, MacLean was assigned to protect passenger\nflights from potential hijackings. See49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a744917(a).On July 26, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nissued a confidential advisory about a potential hijacking plot.\nThe advisory said that members of the terrorist group al Qaeda were\nplanning to attack passenger flights, and that they \u201cconsidered\nsuicide hijackings and bombings as the most promising methods to\ndestroy aircraft in flight, as well as to strike ground targets.\u201d\nApp. 16. The advisory identified a number of potential targets,\nincluding the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and the east coast\nof the United States. Finally, the advisory warned that at least\none of the attacks \u201ccould be executed by the end of the summer\n2003.\u201dIbid.The TSA soon summoned all air marshals (including MacLean) for\nface-to-face briefings about the hijacking plot. During MacLean\u2019s\nbriefing, a TSA official told him that the hijackers were planning\nto \u201csmuggle weapons in camera equipment or children\u2019s toys through\nforeign security,\u201d and then \u201cfly into the United States\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. into an airport that didn\u2019t require them to be\nscreened.\u201dId.,at 92. The hijackers would then board\nU.\u00a0S. flights, \u201coverpower the crew or the Air Marshals and\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. fly the planes into East Coast targets.\u201dId.,at 93.A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the TSA a\ntext message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas until\nearly August. MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, believed\nthat cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was\ndangerous. He also believed that the cancellations were illegal,\ngiven that federal law required the TSA to put an air marshal on\nevery flight that \u201cpresent[s] high security risks,\u201d49\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a744917(a)(2), and provided that \u201cnonstop, long\ndistance flights, such as those targeted on September 11, 2001,\nshould be a priority,\u201d \u00a744917(b). See App. 95, 99, 101.MacLean therefore asked a supervisor why the TSA had canceled\nthe missions. The supervisor responded that the TSA wanted \u201cto save\nmoney on hotel costs because there was no more money in the\nbudget.\u201dId., at 95. MacLean also called the DHS Inspector\nGeneral\u2019s Office to report the cancellations. But a special agent\nin that office told him there was \u201cnothing that could be done.\u201dId.,at 97.Unwilling to accept those responses, MacLean contacted an MSNBC\nreporter and told him about the canceled missions. In turn, the\nreporter published a story about the TSA\u2019s decision, titled \u201cAir\nMarshals pulled from key flights.\u201dId.,at 36. The story\nreported that air marshals would \u201cno longer be covering\ncross-country or international flights\u201d because the agency did not\nwant them \u201cto incur the expense of staying overnight in hotels.\u201dIbid.The story also reported that the cancellations were\n\u201cparticularly disturbing to some\u201d because they \u201ccoincide[d] with\nanew high-level hijacking threat issued by the Department of\nHomeland Security.\u201dId.,at 37.After MSNBC published the story, several Members of Congress\ncriticized the cancellations. Within 24 hours, the TSA reversed its\ndecision and put air marshals back on the flights.Id.,at\n50.At first, the TSA did not know that MacLean was the source of\nthe disclosure. In September 2004, however, MacLean appeared on NBC\nNightly News to criticize the TSA\u2019s dress code for air marshals,\nwhich he believed made them too easy to identify. Although MacLean\nappeared in disguise, several co-workers recognized his voice, and\nthe TSA began investigating the appearance. During that\ninvestigation, MacLean admitted that he had disclosed the text\nmessage back in 2003. Consequently, in April 2006, the TSA fired\nMacLean for disclosing sensitive security information without\nauthorization.MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, arguing in relevant part that his disclosure was\nprotected whistleblowing activity under5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72302(b)(8)(A). The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for\nprotection under that statute, however, because his disclosure was\n\u201cspecifically prohibited by law.\u201d 116 MSPR 562, 569\u2013572 (2011).The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board\u2019s\ndecision. 714 F.\u00a03d 1301 (2013). The parties had agreed that,\nin order for MacLean\u2019s disclosure to be \u201cspecifically prohibitedby law,\u201d it must have been \u201cprohibited by a statute rather\nthan by a regulation.\u201dId.,at 1308 (emphasis added). Thus,\nthe issue before the court was whether the statute authorizing the\nTSA\u2019s regulations\u2014now codified at49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7114(r)(1)\u2014\u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d MacLean\u2019s disclosure. 714\nF.\u00a03d, at 1308.[1]*The court first held that Section 114(r)(1) was not a\nprohibition. The statute did \u201cnot expressly prohibit employee\ndisclosures,\u201d the court explained, but instead empowered the TSA to\n\u201cprescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure[s]\u201d if the TSA\ndecided that disclosing the information would harm public safety.Id.,at 1309. The court therefore concluded that MacLean\u2019s\ndisclosure was prohibited by a regulation, which the parties had\nagreed could not be a \u201claw\u201d under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).Ibid.The court then held that, even if Section 114(r)(1) were a\nprohibition, it was not \u201csufficiently specific.\u201dIbid.The\ncourt explained that a law is sufficiently specific only if it\n\u201crequires that matters be withheld from the public as to leave no\ndiscretion on the issue, or .\u00a0.\u00a0. establishes particular\ncriteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters\nto be withheld.\u201dIbid.(quoting S.\u00a0Rep. No. 95\u2013969\n(1978)). And Section 114(r)(1) did not meet that test because it\n\u201cprovide[d] only general criteria for withholding information and\n[gave] some discretion to the [TSA] to fashion regulations for\nprohibiting disclosure.\u201d 714 F.\u00a03d, at 1309. The court\naccordingly vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded for a\ndetermination of whether MacLean\u2019s disclosure met the other\nrequirements under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).Id.,at\n1310\u20131311.We granted certiorari. 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).IISection 2302(b)(8) provides, in relevant part, that a federal\nagency may not take\u201ca personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant\nfor employment because of\u201c(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant\nwhich the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences\u201c(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or\u201c(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of\nauthority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or\nsafety,\u201cif such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if\nsuch information is not specifically required by Executive order to\nbe kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct\nof foreign affairs.\u201dThe Government argues that this whistleblower statute does not\nprotect MacLean because his disclosure regarding the canceled\nmissions was \u201cspecifically prohibited by law\u201d in two ways. First,\nthe Government argues that the disclosure was specifically\nprohibited by the TSA\u2019s regulations on sensitive security\ninformation: 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a71520.5(a)\u2013(b), 1520.7(j) (2003). Second, the\nGovernment argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited\nby49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7114(r)(1), which authorized the TSA to\npro-mulgate those regulations. We address each argument in\nturn.A1In 2003, the TSA\u2019s regulations prohibited the disclosure of\n\u201c[s]pecific details of aviation security measures .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n[such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air\nMarshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such\noperations.\u201d 49 CFR \u00a71520.7(j). MacLean does not dispute before\nthis Court that the TSA\u2019s regulations prohibited his disclosure\nregarding the canceled missions. Thus, the question here is whether\na disclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is also\n\u201cspecifically prohibitedby law\u201d under Section\n2302(b)(8)(A). (Emphasis added.)The answer is no. Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly\nused the phrase \u201claw, rule, or regulation.\u201d For example, Section\n2302(b)(1)(E) prohibits a federal agency from discriminating\nagainst an employee \u201con the basis of marital status or political\naffiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d For\nanother example, Section 2302(b)(6) prohibits an agency from\n\u201cgrant[ing] any preference or advantage not authorized by law,\nrule, or regulation.\u201d And for a third example, Section\n2302(b)(9)(A) prohibits an agency from retaliating against an\nemployee for \u201cthe exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance\nright granted by any law, rule, or regulation.\u201dIn contrast, Congress did not use the phrase \u201claw, rule, or\nregulation\u201d in the statutory language at issue here; it used the\nword \u201claw\u201d standing alone. That is significant because Congress\ngenerally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in\none section of a statute but omits it in another.Russellov.United States,464 U.\u00a0S. 16,23 (1983). Thus,\nCongress\u2019s choice to say \u201cspecifically prohibited by law\u201d rather\nthan \u201cspecifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation\u201d suggests\nthat Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.The interpretive canon that Congress acts intentionally when it\nomits language included elsewhere applies with particular force\nhere for two reasons. First, Congress used \u201claw\u201d and \u201claw, rule, or\nregulation\u201d in close proximity\u2014indeed, in the same sentence.\n\u00a72302(b)(8)(A) (protecting the disclosure of \u201cany violation of any\nlaw, rule, or regulation .\u00a0.\u00a0. if such disclosure is not\nspecifically prohibited by law\u201d). Second, Congress used the broader\nphrase \u201claw, rule, or regulation\u201d repeatedly\u2014nine times in Section\n2302 alone. See \u00a7\u00a72302(a)(2)(D)(i), (b)(1)(E), (b)(6),\n(b)(8)(A)(i), (b)(8)(B)(i), (b)(9)(A), (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(5).\nThose two aspects of the whistleblower statute make Con-gress\u2019s\nchoice to use the narrower word \u201claw\u201d seem quite deliberate.We drew the same inference inDepartment of Treasury, IRSv.FLRA,494 U.\u00a0S. 922 (1990). There, the Government\nargued that the word \u201claws\u201d in one section of the Civil Service\nReform Act of 1978 meant the same thing as the phrase \u201claw, rule,\nor regulation\u201d in another section of the Act.Id., at 931.\nWe rejected that argument as \u201csim-ply contrary to any reasonable\ninterpretation of the text.\u201dId., at 932. Indeed, we held\nthat a statute that referred to \u201claws\u201d in one section and \u201claw,\nrule, or regulation\u201d in another \u201ccannot, unless we abandon all\npretense at precise communication, be deemed to mean the same thing\nin both places.\u201dIbid.That inference is even more\ncompelling here, because the statute refers to \u201claw\u201d and \u201claw,\nrule, or regulation\u201d in the same sentence, rather than several\nsections apart.Another part of the statutory text points the same way. After\ncreating an exception for disclosures \u201cspecifically prohibited by\nlaw,\u201d Section 2302(b)(8)(A) goes on to create a second exception\nfor information \u201cspecifically required by Executive order to be\nkept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of\nforeign affairs.\u201d This exception is limited to action taken\ndirectly by the President. That suggests that the word \u201claw\u201d in the\nonly other exception is limited to actions by Congress\u2014after all,\nit would be unusual for the first exception to include action taken\nby executive agencies, when the second exception requires action by\nthe President himself.In addition, a broad interpretation of the word \u201claw\u201d could\ndefeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute. If \u201claw\u201d included\nagency rules and regulations, then an agency could insulate itself\nfrom the scope of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) merely by promulgating a\nregulation that \u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d whistleblowing. But\nCongress passed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did\nnot trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their ranks.\nThus, it is unlikely that Congress meant to include rules and\nregulations within the word \u201claw.\u201d2The Government admits that some regulations fall outside the\nword \u201claw\u201d as used in Section 2302(b)(8)(A). But, the Government\nsays, that does not mean thatallregulations are excluded.\nThe Government suggests two interpretations that would distinguish\n\u201claw\u201d from \u201claw, rule, or regulation,\u201d but would still allow the\nword \u201claw\u201dto subsume the TSA\u2019s regulations on sensitive security\ninformation.First, the Government argues that the word \u201claw\u201d includes all\nregulations that have the \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d (i.e.,\nlegislative regulations), while excluding those that do not\n(e.g., interpretive rules). Brief for Petitioner 19\u201322. The\nGovernment bases this argument on our decision inChrysler\nCorp.v.Brown,441 U.\u00a0S. 281 (1979). There, we held\nthat legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of\nthe word \u201claw,\u201d and that it would take a \u201cclear showing of contrary\nlegislative intent\u201d before we concluded otherwise.Id., at\n295\u2013296. Thus, because the TSA\u2019s regulations have the force and\neffect of law, the Government says that they should qualify as\n\u201claw\u201d under the statute.The Government\u2019s description ofChrysleris accurate\nenough. But Congress\u2019s use of the word \u201claw,\u201d in close connection\nwith the phrase \u201claw, rule, or regulation,\u201d provides the necessary\n\u201cclear showing\u201d that \u201claw\u201d does not include regulations. Indeed,\nusing \u201claw\u201d and \u201claw, rule, or regulation\u201d in the same sentence\nwould be a very obscure way of drawing the Government\u2019s nuanced\ndistinction between different types of regulations. Had Congress\nwanted to draw that distinction, there were far easier and clearer\nways to do so. For example, at the time Congress passed Section\n2302(b)(8)(A), another federal statute defined the words\n\u201cregulatory order\u201d to include a \u201crule or regulation, if it has the\nforce and effect of law.\u201d7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7450c(a) (1976 ed.).\nLikewise, another federal statute defined the words \u201cState law\u201d to\ninclude \u201call laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State\naction having the effect of law.\u201d29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71144(c)(1)\n(1976 ed.). As those examples show, Congress knew how to\ndistinguish between regulations that had the force and effect of\nlaw and those that did not, but chose not to do so in Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).Second, the Government argues that the word \u201claw\u201d includes at\nleast those regulations that were \u201cpromulgated pursuant to an\nexpress congressional directive.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 21. Outside\nof this case, however, the Government was unable to find a single\nexample of the word \u201claw\u201d being used in that way. Not a single\ndictionary definition, not a single statute, not a single case. The\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation happens to fit this case precisely, but\nit needs more than that to recommend it.Although the Government argues here that the word \u201claw\u201d includes\nrules and regulations, it definitively re-jected that argument in\nthe Court of Appeals. For example, the Government\u2019s brief accepted\nthat the word \u201claw\u201dmeant \u201clegislative enactment,\u201d and said that the\n\u201conly dispute\u201d was whether49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7114(r)(1)\n\u201cserve[d] as that legislative enactment.\u201d Brief for Respondent in\nNo. 11\u20133231 (CA Fed.), pp. 46\u201347. Then, at oral argument, a judge\nasked the Government\u2019s attorney the following question: \u201cI thought\nI understood your brief to concede that [the word \u201claw\u201d] can\u2019t be a\nrule or regulation, it means statute. Am I wrong?\u201d The Government\u2019s\nattorney responded: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong your honor. I\u2019ll be as clear\nas I can. \u2018Specifically prohibited by law\u2019 here means statute.\u201d\nOral Arg. Audio in No. 11\u20133231, at 22:42\u201323:03; see alsoid., at 29:57\u201330:03 (\u201cNow, as we\u2019ve been discussing here,\nwe\u2019re not saying here that [the word \u201claw\u201d] needs to encompass\nregulations. We\u2019re saying statute.\u201d). Those concessions reinforce\nour conclusion that the Government\u2019s proposed interpretations are\nunpersuasive.In sum, when Congress used the phrase \u201cspecifically prohibited\nby law\u201d instead of \u201cspecifically prohibited by law, rule, or\nregulation,\u201d it meant to exclude rules and regulations. We\ntherefore hold that the TSA\u2019s regulations do not qualify as \u201claw\u201d\nfor purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A).BWe next consider whether MacLean\u2019s disclosure regarding the\ncanceled missions was \u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d by49\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7114(r)(1) itself. As relevant here, that\nstatute provides that the TSA \u201cshall prescribe regulations\nprohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in\ncarrying out security .\u00a0.\u00a0. if the Under Secretary\ndecides that disclosing the information would .\u00a0.\u00a0. be\ndetrimental to the security of transportation.\u201d \u00a7114(r)(1)(C).This statute does not prohibit anything. On the con-trary, itauthorizessomething\u2014it authorizes the Under Secretary to\n\u201cprescribe regulations.\u201d Thus, by its terms Section 114(r)(1) did\nnot prohibit the disclosure at issue here.The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit\nMacLean\u2019s disclosure by imposing a \u201clegislative mandate\u201d on the TSA\nto promulgate regulations to that effect. See Brief for Petitioner\n28, 33; see alsopost, at 2\u20133 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\nBut the Government pushes the statute too far. Section 114(r)(1)\nsays that the TSA shall prohibit disclosures only \u201cif the Under\nSecretary decidesthat disclosing the information would\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\u201d\n\u00a7114(r)(1)(C) (emphasis added). That language affords substantial\ndiscretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any\nparticular disclosure.The dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discretion,\nviewing it as the almost ministerial task of \u201cidentifyingwhether a particular piece of information falls within the scope of\nCongress\u2019 command.\u201dPost, at 3. But determining which\ndocuments meet the statutory standard of \u201cdetrimental to the\nsecurity of transportation\u201d requires the exercise of considerable\njudgment. For example, the Government says that Section 114(r)(1)\nrequires the Under Secretary to prohibit disclosures like\nMacLean\u2019s. The Government also says, however, that the statute does\nnot require the Under Secretary to prohibit an employee from\ndisclosing that \u201cfederal air marshals will be absent from important\nflights, but declining to specify which flights.\u201d Reply Brief 23.\nThat fine-grained distinction comes not from Section 114(r)(1)\nitself, but from the Under Secretary\u2019s exercise of discretion. It\nis the TSA\u2019s regulations\u2014not the statute\u2014that prohibited MacLean\u2019s\ndisclosure. And as the dissent agrees, a regulation does not count\nas \u201claw\u201d under the whistleblower statute. Seepost, at\n1.The Government insists, however, that this grant of discretion\ndoes not make Section 114(r)(1) any less of a prohibition. In\nsupport, the Government relies onAdministrator, FAAv.Robertson,422 U.\u00a0S. 255 (1975). That case involved the\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), which requires federal agencies\nto disclose information upon request unless, among other things,\nthe information is \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by\nstatute.\u201d5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7552(b)(3). InRobertson, we\nheld that the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was one such statute,\nbecause it gave the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u201ca broad\ndegree of discretion\u201d in deciding whether to disclose or withhold\ninformation. 422 U.\u00a0S., at 266.The Government tries to analogize that case to this one. InRobertson, the Government says, the FAA\u2019s discretion whether\nto disclose information did not preclude a finding that the\ninformation was \u201cspecifically exempted\u201d from disclosure by statute.\nSo too here, the Government says, the TSA\u2019s discretion whether to\nprohibit disclosure of information does not preclude a finding that\nthe information is \u201cspecifically prohibited\u201d from disclosure by\nSection 114(r)(1). See Brief for Petitioner 30.This analogy fails. FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) differ in an\nimportant way: The provision of FOIA at issue involves information\nthat is \u201cexempted\u201d from disclosure, while Section\n2302(b)(8)(A) involves information that is \u201cprohibited\u201d from\ndisclosure.A statute that exempts information from mandatory disclosure may\nnonetheless give the agency discretion to release that exempt\ninformation to the public. In such a case, the agency\u2019s exercise of\ndiscretion has no effect on whether the information is \u201cexempted\nfrom disclosureby statute\u201d\u2014it remains exempt whatever the\nagency chooses to do.The situation is different when it comes to a statute giving an\nagency discretion to prohibit the disclosure of information. The\ninformation is not prohibited from disclosureby statuteregardless of what the agency does. Itis the agency\u2019s exercise of\ndiscretion that determines whether there is a prohibition at all.\nThus, when Section 114(r)(1) gave the TSA the discretion to\nprohibit the disclosure of information, the statute did not create\na prohibition\u2014it gave the TSA the power to create one. And because\nSection 114(r)(1) did not create a prohibition, MacLean\u2019s\ndisclosure was not \u201cprohibitedby law\u201d under Section\n2302(b)(8)(A), but only by a regulation issued in the TSA\u2019s\ndiscretion.In any event,Robertsonwas a case about FOIA, not\nSection 2302, and our analysis there depended on two FOIA-specific\nfactors that are not present here. First, we examined the\nlegislative history of FOIA and determined that Congress did not\nintend that statute to affect laws like the Federal Aviation Act.\n422 U.\u00a0S., at 263\u2013265. In particular, we noted that the Civil\nAeronautics Board had expressed its view during congressional\nhearings that the Federal Aviation Act qualified as an exempting\nstatute under FOIA, and that \u201cno question was raised or challenge\nmade\u201d to the agency\u2019s view.Id.,at 264\u2013265. But that\nlegislative history can have no effect on our analysis of Section\n2302(b)(8)(A).Second, we said that the Federal Aviation Act could fail to\nqualify as an exempting statute only if we read FOIA \u201cas repealing\nby implication all existing statutes which restrict public access\nto specific Government records.\u201dId.,at 265 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Then, relying on the presumption that\n\u201crepeals by implication are disfavored,\u201d we rejected that\ninterpretation of FOIA. But the presumption against implied repeals\nhas no relevance here. Saying that Section 114(r)(1) is not a\nprohibition under the whistleblower statute is not the same as\nsaying that the whistleblower statute implicitly repealed Section\n114(r)(1). On the contrary, Section 114(r)(1) remains in force by\nallowing the TSA to deny FOIA requests and prohibit employee\ndisclosures that do not qualify for whistleblower protection under\nSection 2302(b)(8)(A).Ultimately, FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) are different\nstatutes\u2014they have different language, different histories, and\nwere enacted in different contexts. Our interpretation of one,\ntherefore, has no impact whatsoever on our interpretation of the\nother.IIIFinally, the Government warns that providing whistleblower\nprotection to individuals like MacLean would \u201cgravely endanger\npublic safety.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 38. That protection, the\nGovernment argues, would make the confidentiality of sensitive\nsecurity information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each\nof the TSA\u2019s 60,000 employees.Id., at 37. And those\nemployees will \u201cmost likely lack access to all of the information\nthat led the TSA to make particular security decisions.\u201dId., at 38. Thus, the Government says, we should conclude\nthat Congress did not intend for Section 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover\ndisclosures like MacLean\u2019s.Those concerns are legitimate. But they are concerns that must\nbe addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this\nCourt. Congress could, for example, amend Section 114(r)(1) so that\nthe TSA\u2019s prohibitions on disclosure override the whistleblower\nprotections in Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\u2014just as those prohibitions\ncurrently override FOIA. See \u00a7114(r)(1) (authorizing the TSA to\nprohibit disclosures \u201c[n]otwithstanding section 552 of title 5\u201d);\nsee also10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72640(h) (\u201cthe Secretary of Defense\nmay (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold from\npublic disclosure safety-related information that is provided to\nthe Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for the purposes of\nthis section\u201d). Congress could also exempt the TSA from the\nrequirements of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) entirely, as Congress has\nalready done for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central\nIntelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National\nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National\nReconnaissance Office. See5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a72302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I).Likewise, the President could prohibit the disclosure of\nsensitive security information by Executive order. Indeed, the\nGovernment suggested at oral argument that the President could\n\u201centirely duplicate\u201d the regulations that the TSA has issued under\nSection 114(r)(1). Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\u201320. Such an action would\nundoubtedly create an exception to the whistleblower protections\nfound in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).Although Congress and the President each has the power to\naddress the Government\u2019s concerns, neither has done so. It is not\nour role to do so for them.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit isAffirmed.Notes1*\u00a0This statute has a complicated\nhistory. It was codified at 49 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\u00a740119(b)(1) when\nthe TSA initially promulgated its regulations on sensitive security\ninformation. It was codified at \u00a7114(s)(1) when MacLean disclosed\nthe text message to MSNBC. And it is now codified at \u00a7114(r)(1).\nThe Federal Circuit referred to \u00a740119(b)(1) in its opinion.\nBecause the statute has remained identical in all relevant\nrespects, however, we and the parties refer to the current\nversion.",
