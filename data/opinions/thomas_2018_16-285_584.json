I write\nseparately to add that the employees also cannot prevail under the\nplain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act. The Act declares\narbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforce- able, save\nupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72. As I have previously\nexplained, grounds for revocation of a contract are those that\nconcern \u201c\u00a0\u2018the formation of the arbitration agreement.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmerican Express Co.v.Italian Colors Restaurant,\n570 U.\u00a0S. 228, 239 (2013) (concurring opinion) (quotingAT&T Mobility LLCv.Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S.\n333, 353 (2011) (Thomas, J., concurring)). The employees argue,\namong other things, that the class waivers in their arbitration\nagreements are unenforceable because the National Labor Relations\nAct makes those waivers illegal. But illegality is a public-policy\ndefense. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7178\u2013179 (1979);McMullenv.Hoffman, 174 U.\u00a0S. 639, 669\u2013670\n(1899). Because \u201c[r]efusal to enforce a contract for public-policy\nreasons does not concern whether the contract was properly made,\u201d\nthe saving clause does not apply here.Concepcion,supra, at 357. For this reason, and the reasons in the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, the employees\u2019 arbitration agreements must be\nenforced according to their terms.",
