JAMES ALVIN\nCASTLEMANon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit[March 26, 2014]Justice Alito, with\nwhom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.The decision in this\ncase turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201chas, as an element,\nthe use .\u00a0.\u00a0. of physical force.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). In Johnson v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. 133 (2010) , the Court interpreted the very same\nlanguage and held that \u201cphysical force\u201d means\n\u201cviolent force.\u201d Id., at 140. I disagreed and concluded\nthat the phrase incorporated the well-established meaning of\n\u201cforce\u201d under the common law of battery, which did not\nrequire violent force. See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).The Court of Appeals in\nthe present case understand-ably followed the reasoning of Johnson,\nbut now this Court holds that Johnson actually dictates that the\nidentical statutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way\nthat the Johnson majority rejected. See ante, at 5.In my view, the meaning\nof the contested statutory language is the same now as it was four\nyears ago in Johnson, and therefore, for the reasons set out in my\nJohnson dissent, I would not extend the reasoning of Johnson to the\nquestion presented here, on which the Johnson Court specifically\nreserved judgment. 559 U.\u00a0S., at 143\u2013144.",
