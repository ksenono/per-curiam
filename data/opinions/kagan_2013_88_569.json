EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPLAN, PETITIONERv.JAMES E. McCUTCHEN et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[April 16, 2013]Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.Respondent James McCutchen participated in a\nhealth benefits plan that his employer, petitioner US Airways,\nestablished under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974 (ERISA), 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001et\u00a0seq.That\nplan obliged US Airways to pay any medical ex- penses McCutchen\nincurred as a result of a third party\u2019s actions\u2014for example,\nanother person\u2019s negligent driving. The plan in turn entitled US\nAirways to reimbursement if McCutchen later recovered money from\nthe third party.This Court has held that a health-plan\nadministrator like US Airways may enforce such a reimbursement\nprovision by filing suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) of ERISA, 88Stat. 891, 29\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71132(a)(3). SeeSereboffv.Mid\nAtlantic Medical Services, Inc.,547 U.S.\n356(2006). That section authorizes a civil action \u201cto obtain\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. appropriate equitable relief .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\nenforce .\u00a0.\u00a0. the terms of the plan.\u201d We here consider\nwhether in that kind of suit, a plan participant like McCutchen may\nraise certain equitable defenses deriving from principles of unjust\nenrichment. In particular, we address one equitable doctrine\nlimiting reimbursement to the amount of an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble\nrecovery\u201d and another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to\npay a share of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in securing funds from\nthe third party. We hold that neither of those equitable rules can\noverride the clear terms of a plan. But we explain that the latter,\nusually called the common-fund doctrine, plays a role in\ninterpreting US Airways\u2019 plan because the plan is silent about\nallocating the costs of recovery.IIn January 2007, McCutchen suffered serious\ninjuries when another driver lost control of her car and collided\nwith McCutchen\u2019s. At the time, McCutchen was an employee of US\nAirways and a participant in its self-funded health plan. The plan\npaid $66,866 in medical expenses arising from the accident on\nMcCutchen\u2019s behalf.McCutchen retained attorneys, in exchange for a\n40% contingency fee, to seek recovery of all his accident-related\ndamages, estimated to exceed $1 million. The attorneys sued the\ndriver responsible for the crash, but settled for only $10,000\nbecause she had limited insurance coverage and the accident had\nkilled or seriously injured three other people. Counsel also\nsecured a payment from McCutchen\u2019s own automobile insurer of\n$100,000, the maximum amount available under his policy. McCutchen\nthus received $110,000\u2014and after deducting $44,000 for the lawyer\u2019s\nfee, $66,000.On learning of McCutchen\u2019s recovery, US Airways\ndemanded reimbursement of the $66,866 it had paid in medical\nexpenses. In support of that claim, US Airways relied on the\nfollowing statement in its summary plan description:\u201cIf [US Airways] pays benefits for any\nclaim you incur as the result of negligence, willful misconduct, or\nother actions of a third party, .\u00a0.\u00a0. [y]ou will be\nrequired to reimburse [US Airways] for amounts paid for claims out\nof any monies recovered from [the] third party, including, but not\nlimited to, your own insurance company as the result of judgment,\nsettlement, or otherwise.\u201d App. 20.[1]McCutchen denied that US Airways was entitled to\nany reimbursement, but his attorneys placed $41,500 in an escrow\naccount pending resolution of the dispute. That amount represented\nUS Airways\u2019 full claim minus a proportionate share of the promised\nattorney\u2019s fees.US Airways then filed this action under\n\u00a7502(a)(3), seeking \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u201d to enforce the\nplan\u2019s reimbursement provision. The suit requested an equitable\nlien on $66,866\u2014the $41,500 in the escrow account and $25,366 more\nin McCutchen\u2019s possession. McCutchen countered by raising two\ndefenses relevant here. First, he maintained that US Airways could\nnot receive the relief it sought because he had recovered only a\nsmall portion of his total damages; absent over-recovery on his\npart, US Airways\u2019 right to reimbursement did not kick in. Second,\nhe contended that US Airways at least had to contribute its fair\nshare to the costs he incurred to get his recovery; any\nreimbursement therefore had to be marked down by 40%, to cover the\npromised contingency fee. The District Court rejected both\narguments, granting summary judgment to US Airways on the ground\nthat the plan \u201cclear[ly] and unambiguous[ly]\u201d provided for full\nreimbursement of the medical expenses paid. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n30a; seeid.,at 32a.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nvacated the District Court\u2019s order. The Third Circuit reasoned that\nin a suit for \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3), a\ncourt must apply any \u201cequitable doctrines and defenses\u201d that\ntraditionally limited the relief requested. 663 F.3d 671, 676 (CA3\n2011). And here, the court continued, \u201c\u00a0\u2018the principle of\nunjust enrichment\u2019\u00a0\u201d should \u201c\u00a0\u2018serve to limit the\neffectiveness\u2019\u00a0\u201d of the plan\u2019s reimbursement provision. Seeid.,at 677 (quoting 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution \u00a723.18,\np. 472\u2013473 (1978)). Full reimbursement, the Third Circuit thought,\nwould \u201cleav[e] [McCutchen] with less than full payment\u201d for his\nmedical bills; at the same time, it would provide a \u201cwindfall\u201d to\nUS Airways given its failure to \u201ccontribute to the cost of\nobtaining the third-party recovery.\u201d 663 F.\u00a03d, at 679. The\nThird Circuit then instructed the District Court to determine what\namount, shy of the entire $66,866, would qualify as \u201cappropriate\nequitable relief.\u201dIbid.We granted certiorari, 567 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2012), to resolve a circuit split on whether equitable defenses\ncan so override an ERISA plan\u2019s reimbursement provision.[2] We now vacate the Third Circuit\u2019s\ndecision.IIA health-plan administrator like US Airways\nmay bring suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) for \u201cappropriate equitable relief\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to enforce .\u00a0.\u00a0. the terms of the\nplan.\u201d[3] That provision, we\nhave held, authorizes the kinds of relief \u201ctypically available in\nequity\u201d in the days of \u201cthe divided bench,\u201d before law and equity\nmerged.Mertensv.Hewitt Associates,508 U.S.\n248, 256 (1993) (emphasis deleted).InSereboffv.Mid Atlantic Medical\nServices, we allowed a health-plan administrator to bring a\nsuit just like this one under \u00a7502(a)(3). Mid Atlantic had paid\nmedical expenses for the Sereboffs after they were injured in a car\ncrash. When they settled a tort suit against the other driver, Mid\nAtlantic claimed a share of the proceeds, invoking the plan\u2019s\nreimbursement clause. We held that Mid Atlantic\u2019s action sought\n\u201cequitable relief,\u201d as \u00a7502(a)(3) requires. See 547 U.\u00a0S., at\n369. The \u201cnature of the recovery\u201d requested was equitable because\nMid Atlantic claimed \u201cspecifically identifiable funds\u201d within the\nSereboffs\u2019 control\u2014that is, a portion of the settlement they had\ngotten.Id., at 362\u2013363 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd the \u201cbasis for [the] claim\u201d was equitable too, because Mid\nAtlantic relied on \u201c\u00a0\u2018the familiar rul[e] of equity that a\ncontract to convey a specific object\u2019\u00a0\u201d not yet acquired\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018create[s] a lien\u2019\u00a0\u201d on that object as soon as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018the contractor .\u00a0.\u00a0. gets a title to the\nthing.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 363\u2013364 (quotingBarnesv.Alexander,232 U.S.\n117, 121 (1914)). Mid Atlantic\u2019s claim for reimbursement, we\ndetermined, was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to\nenforce such a contract-based lien\u2014called an \u201cequitable lien by\nagreement.\u201d 547 U.\u00a0S., at 364\u2013365 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, Mid Atlantic could bring an action under\n\u00a7502(a)(3) seeking the funds that its beneficiaries had promised to\nturn over. And here, as all parties agree, US Airways can do the\nsame thing.The question in this case concerns the role that\nequitable defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a\nsuit. As earlier noted, the Third Circuit held that \u201cthe principle\nof unjust enrichment\u201d overrides US Airways\u2019 reimbursement clause if\nand when they come into conflict. 663 F.\u00a03d, at 677. McCutchen\noffers a more refined version of that view, alleging that two\nspecific equitable doctrines meant to \u201cprevent unjust enrichment\u201d\ndefeat the reimbursement provision. Brief for Respondents i. First,\nhe contends that in equity, an insurer in US Airways\u2019 position\ncould recoup no more than an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble recovery\u201d\u2014the amount\nthe insured has received from a third party to compensate for the\nsame loss the insurance covered. That rule would limit US Airways\u2019\nreimbursement to the share of McCutchen\u2019s settlements paying for\nmedical expenses; McCutchen would keep the rest (e.g.,damages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering), even\nthough the plan gives US Airways first claim on the whole\nthird-party recovery. Second, McCutchen claims that in equity the\ncommon-fund doctrine would have operated to reduce any award to US\nAirways. Under that rule, \u201ca litigant or a lawyer who recovers a\ncommon fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his\nclient is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as\na whole.\u201dBoeing Co.v.Van Gemert,444 U.S.\n472, 478 (1980). McCutchen urges that this doctrine, which is\ndesigned to prevent freeloading, enables him to pass on a share of\nhis lawyer\u2019s fees to US Airways, no matter what the plan\nprovides.[4]We rejected a similar claim inSereboff,\nthough without altogether foreclosing McCutchen\u2019s position. The\nSereboffs argued, among other things, that the lower courts erred\nin enforcing Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement clause \u201cwithout imposing\nvarious limitations\u201d that would \u201capply to truly equitable relief\ngrounded in principles of subrogation.\u201d[5] 547 U.\u00a0S., at 368 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In particular, the Sereboffs contended that a variant of\nthe double-recovery rule, called the make-whole doctrine, trumped\nthe plan\u2019s terms. We rebuffed that argument, explaining that the\nSereboffs were improperly mixing and matching rules from different\nequitable boxes. The Sereboffs asserted a \u201cparcel of equitable\ndefenses\u201d available when an out-of-pocket insurer brought a\n\u201cfreestanding action for equitable subrogation,\u201d not founded on a\ncontract, to succeed to an insured\u2019s judgment against a third\nparty.Ibid.But Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement claim was\n\u201cconsidered equitable,\u201d we replied, because it sought to enforce a\n\u201c\u00a0lien based on agreement\u00a0\u201d\u2014nota lien imposed\nindependent of contract by virtue of equitable\nsubrogation.[6]Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted). In light of that fact, we\nviewed the Sereboffs\u2019 equitable defenses\u2014which again, closely\nresemble McCutchen\u2019s\u2014as \u201cbeside the point.\u201dIbid.And yet,\nwe left a narrow opening for future litigants in the Sereboffs\u2019\nposition to make a like claim. In a footnote, we observed that the\nSereboffs had forfeited a \u201cdistinct assertion\u201d that the\ncontract-based relief Mid Atlantic requested, although \u201cequitable,\u201d\nwas not \u201cappropriate\u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3) because \u201cit contravened\nprinciples like the make-whole doctrine.\u201dId., at 368\u2013369 n.\n2. Enter McCutchen, to make that basic argument.In the end, however,Sereboff\u2019s logic\ndooms McCutchen\u2019s effort. US Airways, like Mid Atlantic, is seeking\nto enforce the modern-day equivalent of an \u201cequitable lien by\nagreement.\u201d And that kind of lien\u2014as its name announces\u2014both arises\nfrom and serves to carry out a contract\u2019s provisions. Seeid., at 363\u2013364; 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence\n\u00a71234, p. 695 (5th ed. 1941). So enforcing the lien means holding\nthe parties to their mutual promises. See,e.g.,Barnes, 232 U.\u00a0S., at 121;Walkerv.Brown,165 U.S.\n654, 664 (1897). Conversely, it means declining to apply\nrules\u2014even if they would be \u201cequitable\u201d in a contract\u2019s absence\u2014at\nodds with the parties\u2019 expressed commitments. McCutchen therefore\ncannot rely on theories of unjust enrichment to defeat US Airways\u2019\nappeal to the plan\u2019s clear terms. Those principles, as we said inSereboff, are \u201cbeside the point\u201d when parties demand what\nthey bargained for in a valid agreement. See Restatement (Third) of\nRestitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a72(2), p. 15 (2010) (\u201cA valid\ncontract defines the obligations of the parties as to matters\nwithin its scope, displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust\nenrichment\u201d). In those circumstances, hewing to the parties\u2019\nexchange yields \u201cappropriate\u201d as well as \u201cequitable\u201d relief.We have found nothing to the contrary in the\nhistoric practice of equity courts. McCutchen offers us a slew of\ncases in which those courts applied the double-recovery or\ncommon-fund rule to limit insurers\u2019 efforts to recoup funds from\ntheir beneficiaries\u2019 tort judgments. See Brief for Respondents\n21\u201325. But his citations are not on point. In some of McCutchen\u2019s\ncases, courts apparently applied equitable doctrines in the absence\nof any relevant contract provision. See,e.g., Washtenaw Mut.\nFire Ins. Co.v.Budd, 208 Mich. 483, 486\u2013487, 175 N.W.\n231, 232 (1919);Fire Assn. of Philadelphiav.Wells,\n84 N.\u00a0J. Eq. 484, 487, 94 A. 619, 621 (1915). In others,\ncourts found those rules to comport with the applicable contract\nterm. For example, inSvea Assurance Co.v.Packham,\n92 Md. 464, 48 A. 359 (1901)\u2014the case McCutchen calls his best, see\nTr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348\u2014the court viewed the double-recovery rule as\naccording with \u201cthe intention\u201d of the contracting parties; \u201c[b]road\nas [the] language is,\u201d the court explained, the agreement \u201ccannot\nbe construed to\u201d give the insurer any greater recovery. 92 Md., at\n478, 48 A., at 362; see alsoKnafflv.Knoxville Banking\n& Trust Co., 133 Tenn. 655, 661, 182 S.W. 232, 233 (1916);Camden Fire Ins. Assn.v.Prezioso, 93 N.\u00a0J. Eq.\n318, 319\u2013320, 116 A. 694, 694 (Ch. Div. 1922). But in none of these\ncases\u2014nor in any other we can find\u2014did an equity court apply the\ndouble-recovery or common-fund rule to override a plain contract\nterm. That is, in none did an equity court do what McCutchen asks\nof us.Nevertheless, the United States, appearing asamicus curiae, claims that the common-fund rule has a\nspecial capacity to trump a conflicting contract. The Government\nbegins its brief foursquare with our (andSereboff\u2019s)\nanalysis: In a suit like this one, to enforce an equitable lien by\nagreement, \u201cthe agreement, not general restitutionary principles of\nunjust enrichment, provides the measure of relief due.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 6. Because that is so, the Government (naturally\nenough) concludes, McCutchen cannot invoke the double-recovery rule\nto defeat the plan. But then the Government takes an unexpected\nturn. \u201cWhen it comes to the costs incurred\u201d by a beneficiary to\nobtain money from a third party, \u201cthe terms of the plan do not\ncontrol.\u201dId.,at 21. An equity court, the Government\ncontends, has \u201cinherent authority\u201d to apportion litigation costs in\naccord with the \u201clongstanding equitable common-fund doctrine,\u201d even\nif that conflicts with the parties\u2019 contract.Id.,at\n22.But if the agreement governs, the agreement\ngoverns: The reasons we have given (and the Government mostly ac-\ncepts) for looking to the contract\u2019s terms do not permit an\nattorney\u2019s-fees exception. We have no doubt that the common-fund\ndoctrine has deep roots in equity. SeeSpraguev.Ticonic\nNat. Bank,307 U.S.\n161, 164 (1939) (tracing equity courts\u2019 authority over fees to\nthe First Judiciary Act). Those roots, however, are set in the soil\nof unjust enrichment: To allow \u201cothers to obtain full benefit from\nthe plaintiff\u2019s efforts without contributing .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the\nlitigation expenses,\u201d we have often noted, \u201cwould be to enrich the\nothers unjustly at the plaintiff\u2019s expense.\u201dMillsv.Electric Auto-Lite Co.,396 U.S.\n375, 392 (1970); seeBoeing, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 478;Trusteesv.Greenough,105 U.S.\n527, 532 (1882);supra,at 6\u20137 and n. 4. And as we have\njust explained, principles of unjust enrichment give way when a\ncourt enforces an equitable lien by agreement. Seesupra,at\n8\u20139. The agreement itself becomes the measure of the parties\u2019\nequities; so if a contract abrogates the common-fund doctrine, the\ninsurer is not unjustly enriched by claiming the benefit of its\nbargain. That is why the Government, like McCutchen, fails to\nproduce a single case in which an equity court applied the\ncommon-fund rule (any more than the double-recovery rule) when a\ncontract provided to the contrary. Even in equity, when a party\nsought to enforce a lien by agreement, all provisions of that\nagreement controlled. So too, then, in a suit like this one.The result we reach, based on the historical\nanalysis our prior cases prescribe, fits lock and key with ERISA\u2019s\nfocus on what a plan provides. The section under which this suit is\nbrought \u201cdoes not, after all, authorize \u2018appropriate equitable\nrelief\u2019at large,\u201dMertens, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 253\n(quoting \u00a71132(a)(3)); rather, it countenances only such relief as\nwill enforce \u201cthe terms of the plan\u201d or the statute,\n\u00a71132(a)(3) (emphasis added). That limitation reflects ERISA\u2019s\nprincipal function: to \u201cprotect contractually defined benefits.\u201dMassachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.Russell,473 U.S.\n134, 148 (1985). The statutory scheme, we have often noted, \u201cis\nbuilt around reliance on the face of written plan documents.\u201dCurtiss-Wright Corp.v.Schoonejongen,514 U.S.\n73, 83 (1995). \u201cEvery employee benefit plan shall be\nestablished and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\u201d\n\u00a71102(a)(1), and an administrator must act \u201cin accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan\u201d insofar as they\naccord with the statute, \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). The plan, in short, is at\nthe center of ERISA. And precluding McCutchen\u2019s equitable defenses\nfrom overriding plain contract terms helps it to remain there.IIIYet McCutchen\u2019s arguments are not all for\nnaught. If the equitable rules he describes cannot trump a\nreimbursement provision, they still might aid in properly\nconstruing it. And for US Airways\u2019 plan, the common-fund doctrine\n(though not the double-recovery rule) serves that function. The\nplan is silent on the allocation of attorney\u2019s fees, and in those\ncircumstances, the common-fund doctrine provides the appropriate\ndefault. In other words, if US Airways wished to depart from the\nwell-established common-fund rule, it had to draft its contract to\nsay so\u2014and here it did not.[7]Ordinary principles of contract interpretation\npoint toward this conclusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as they\ndo other contracts, by \u201clooking to the terms of the plan\u201d as well\nas to \u201cother manifestations of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201dFirestone\nTire & Rubber Co.v.Bruch,489\nU.S. 101, 113 (1989). The words of a plan may speak clearly,\nbut they may also leave gaps. And so a court must often \u201clook\noutside the plan\u2019s written language\u201d to decide what an agreement\nmeans.CIGNA Corp.v.Amara, 563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(slip op., at 13); seeCurtiss-Wright, 514 U.\u00a0S., at\n80\u201381. In undertaking that task, a court properly takes account of\nbackground legal rules\u2014the doctrines that typically or\ntraditionally have governed a given situation when no agreement\nstates otherwise. SeeWal-Mart Stores, Inc.Assoc. Health\n& Welfare Planv.Wells,213 F.3d 398, 402 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.) (\u201c[C]ontracts\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. are enacted against a background of common-sense\nunderstandings and legal principles that the parties may not have\nbothered to incorporate expressly but that operate as default rules\nto govern in the absence of a clear expression of the parties\u2019\n[contrary] intent\u201d); 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a731:7 (4th\ned. 2012); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7221 (1979). Indeed,\nignoring those rules is likely to frustrate the parties\u2019 intent and\nproduce perverse consequences.The reimbursement provision at issue here\nprecludes looking to the double-recovery rule in this manner. Both\nthe contract term and the equitable principle address the same\nproblem: how to apportion, as between an insurer and a beneficiary,\na third party\u2019s payment to recompense an injury. But the allocation\nformulas they prescribe differ markedly. According to the plan, US\nAirways has first claim on the entire recovery\u2014as the plan\ndescription states, on \u201cany monies recovered from [the] third\nparty\u201d; McCutchen receives only whatever is left over (if\nanything). Seesupra,at 3. By contrast, the double-recovery\nrule would giveMcCutchenfirst dibs on the portion of the\nrecovery compensating for losses that the plan did not cover\n(e.g.,future earnings or pain and suffering); US Airways\u2019\nclaim would attach only to the share of the recovery for medical\nexpenses. Seesupra,at 6\u20137. The express contract term, in\nshort, contradicts the background equitable rule; and where that is\nso, for all the reasons we have given, the agreement must\ngovern.By contrast, the plan provision here leaves\nspace for the common-fund rule to operate. That equitable doctrine,\nas earlier noted, addresses not how to allocate a third-party\nrecovery, but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining it. Seesupra,at 7. And the contract, for its part, says nothing\nspecific about that issue. The District Court below thus erred when\nit found that the plan clearly repudiated the common-fund rule. Seesupra,at 4. To be sure, the plan\u2019s allocation formula\u2014first\nclaim on the recovery goes to US Airways\u2014mightoperate on\nevery dollar received from a third party, even those covering the\nbeneficiary\u2019s litigation costs. But alternatively, that formula\ncould apply to only the true recovery, after the costs of obtaining\nit are deducted. (Consider, for comparative purposes, how an income\ntax is levied on net, not gross, receipts.) See Dawson, Lawyers and\nInvoluntary Clients: Attorney Fees From Funds, 87 Harv.\nL.\u00a0Rev. 1597, 1606\u20131607 (1974) (\u201c[T]he claim for legal\nservices is a first charge on the fund and must be satisfied before\nany distribution occurs\u201d). The plan\u2019s terms fail to select between\nthese two alternatives: whether the recovery to which US Airways\nhas first claim is every cent the third party paid or, instead, the\nmoney the beneficiary took away.Given that contractual gap, the common-fund\ndoctrine provides the best indication of the parties\u2019 intent. No\none can doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here in the\nabsence of a contrary agreement. This Court has \u201crecognized\nconsistently\u201d that someone \u201cwho recovers a common fund for the\nbenefit of persons other than himself\u201d is due \u201ca reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee from the fund as whole.\u201dBoeing Co., 444\nU.\u00a0S., at 478. We have understood that rule as \u201creflect[ing]\nthe traditional practice in courts of equity.\u201dIbid.; seeSprague, 307 U.\u00a0S., at 164\u2013166;supra,at 11.\nAnd we have applied it in a wide range of circumstances as part of\nour inherent authority. SeeBoeing Co., 444 U.\u00a0S., at\n474, 478;Hallv.Cole,412 U.S.\n1, 6\u20137 and n. 7 (1973);Mills, 396 U.\u00a0S., at\n389\u2013390, 392;Sprague, 307 U.\u00a0S., at 166;Central\nRailroad & Banking Co. of Ga.v.Pettus,113 U.S.\n116, 126\u2013127 (1885);Greenough, 105 U.\u00a0S., at 528,\n531\u2013533. State courts have done the same; the \u201coverwhelming\nmajority\u201d routinely use the common-fund rule to allocate the costs\nof third-party recoveries between insurers and beneficiaries. 8A\nAppleman \u00a74903.85, at 335 (1981); see Annot., 2 A.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\n3d 1441, \u00a7\u00a72\u20133 (1965 and Supp. 2012). A party would not typically\nexpect or intend a plan saying nothing about attorney\u2019s fees to\nabrogate so strong and uniform a background rule. And that means a\ncourt should be loath to read such a plan in that way.[8]The rationale for the common-fund rule\nreinforces that conclusion. Third-party recoveries do not often\ncome free: To get one, an insured must incur lawyer\u2019s fees and\nexpenses. Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its\nbeneficiary\u2019s efforts\u2014taking the fruits while contributing nothing\nto the labor. Odder still, in some cases\u2014indeed, in this case\u2014the\nbeneficiary is made worse off by pursuing a third party. Recall\nthat McCutchen spent $44,000 (representing a 40% contingency fee)\nto get $110,000, leaving him with a real recovery of $66,000. But\nUS Airways claimed $66,866 in medical expenses. That would put\nMcCutchen $866 in the hole; in effect, he would pay for the\nprivilege of serving as US Airways\u2019 collection agent. We think\nMcCutchen would not have foreseen that result when he signed on to\nthe plan. And we doubt if even US Airways should want it. When the\nnext McCutchen comes along, he is not likely to relieve US Airways\nof the costs of recovery. SeeBlackburnv.Sundstrand\nCorp.,115 F.3d 493,496(CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (\u201c[I]f .\u00a0.\u00a0. injured\npersons could not charge legal costs against recoveries, people\nlike [McCutchen] would in the future have every reason\u201d to make\ndifferent judgments about bringing suit, \u201cthrowing on plans the\nburden and expense of collection\u201d). The prospect of generating\nthose strange results again militates against reading a general\nreimbursement provision\u2014like the one here\u2014for more than it is\nworth. Only if US Airways\u2019 plan expressly addressed the costs of\nrecovery would it alter the common-fund doctrine.IVOur holding today has two parts, one favoring\nUS Airways, the other McCutchen. First, in an action brought under\n\u00a7502(a)(3) based on an equitable lien by agreement, the terms of\nthe ERISA plan govern. Neither general principles of unjust\nenrichment nor specific doctrines reflecting those principles\u2014such\nas the double-recovery or common-fund rules\u2014can override the\napplicable contract. We therefore reject the Third Circuit\u2019s\ndecision. But second, the common-fund rule informs interpretation\nof US Airways\u2019 reimbursement provision. Because that term does not\nadvert to the costs of recovery, it is properly read to retain the\ncommon-fund doctrine. We therefore also disagree with the District\nCourt\u2019s decision. In light of these rulings, we vacate the judgment\nbelow and re- mand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1We have made clear that\nthe statements in a summary plan description \u201ccommunicat[e] with\nbeneficiariesaboutthe plan, but .\u00a0.\u00a0. donot\nthemselves constitute thetermsof the plan.\u201dCIGNA\nCorp.v.Amara,563 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 15). Nonetheless, the parties litigated this case, and both\nlower courts decided it, based solely on the language quoted above.\nSee 663 F.3d 671, 673 (CA3 2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. Only\nin this Court, in response to a request from the Solicitor General,\ndid the plan itself come to light. See Letter from Matthew\nW.\u00a0H. Wessler to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (Nov. 19,\n2012) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). That is too late\nto affect what happens here: Because everyone in this case has\ntreated the language from the summary description as though it came\nfrom the plan, we do so as well.2Compare 663 F.3d 671, 673\n(CA3 2011) (case below) (holding that equitable doctrines can trump\na plan\u2019s terms);CGI Technologies & Solutions Inc.v.Rose, 683 F.3d 1113, 1124 (CA9 2012) (same), withZurich\nAm.

SeeBoeing, 444 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 478 (\u201cThe [common-fund] doctrine rests on the perception that\npersons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to\nits cost are unjustly enriched\u201d);Millsv.Electric\nAuto-Lite Co.,396 U.S.\n375, 392 (1970) (similar); 1 D.

Supp. 2012) (hereinafter Appleman) (similar).5\u201cSubrogation simply means\nsubstitution of one person for another; that is, one person is\nallowed to stand in the shoes of another and assert that person\u2019s\nrights against\u201d a third party. 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(4), at 604; see 8B\nAppleman \u00a74941, at 11 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Subrogation\u2019 involves the\nsubstitution of the insurer .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the rights of the\ninsured\u201d).6TheSereboffCourt\u2019s analysis concerned only subrogation actions based on\nequitable principles independent of any agreement. A subrogation\naction may also be founded on a contract incorporating those\nprinciples. See 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(4), at 604. US Airways suggested at\noral argument that McCutchen\u2019s case would \u201cge[t] a lot stronger\u201d if\nthe plan here spoke only of subrogation, without separately\ngranting a right of reimbursement. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. We need not\nconsider that question because US Airways seeks to enforce a\nreimbursement provision, of the same kind we considered inSereboff.7The dissent faults us for\naddressing this issue, but we think it adequately preserved and\npresented. The language the dissent highlights in McCutchen\u2019s brief\nin opposition, indicating that the plan clearly abrogates the\ncommon-fund doctrine, comes from his description ofUS\nAirways\u2019claim in the District Court. Seepost, at 1\n(opinion of Scalia, J.); Brief in Opposition 5.McCutchen\u2019sargument in that court urged the very position we adopt\u2014that the\ncommon-fund doctrine applies because the plan is silent. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 30a; Defendants\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to\nPlaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 2:08\u2013cv\u20131593 (WD\nPa., Dec. 4, 2011), Doc. 33, pp.\u00a012\u201313 (\u201cIf [US Airways]\nwanted to exclude a deduction for attorney fees, it easily could\nhave so expressed\u201d). To be sure, McCutchen shifted ground on appeal\nbecause the District Court ruled that Third Circuit precedent\nforeclosed his contract-based argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert.\n31a; the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision then put front-and-center his\nalternative contention that the common-fund rule trumps a contract.\nBut both claims have the same basis (the nature and function of the\ncommon-fund doctrine), which the parties have disputed throughout\nthis litigation. And similarly, the question we decide here is\nincluded in the question presented. The principal clause of that\nquestion asks whether a court may use \u201cequitable principles to\nrewrite contractual language.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. We answer \u201cnot\nrewrite, but inform\u201d\u2014a reply well within the question\u2019s\nscope.8For that reason, almost\nevery state court that has confronted the issue has done what we do\nhere: apply the common-fund doctrine inthe face of a contract\ngiving an insurer a general right to recoup funds from an insured\u2019s\nthird-party recovery, without specifically addressing attorney\u2019s\nfees.
