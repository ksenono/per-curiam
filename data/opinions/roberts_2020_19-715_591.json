TRUMP, et al., PETITIONERS19\u2013715v.MAZARS USA, LLP, et al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuitDONALD J. TRUMP, et al., PETITIONERS19\u2013760v.DEUTSCHE BANK AG, et al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit[July 9, 2020]Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court.Over the course of five days in April 2019,\nthree committees of the U.\u00a0S. House of Representatives issued\nfour subpoenas seeking information about the finances of President\nDonald J. Trump, his children, and affiliated businesses. We have\nheld that the House has authority under the Constitution to issue\nsubpoenas to assist it in carrying out its legislative\nresponsibilities. The House asserts that the financial information\nsought here\u2014encompassing a decade\u2019s worth of transactions by the\nPresident and his family\u2014will help guide legislative reform in\nareas ranging from money laundering and terrorism to foreign\ninvolvement in U.\u00a0S. elections. The President contends that\nthe House lacked a valid legislative aim and instead sought these\nrecords to harass him, expose personal matters, and conduct law\nenforcement activities beyond its authority. The question presented\nis whether the subpoenas exceed the authority of the House under\nthe Constitution.We have never addressed a congressional subpoena\nfor the President\u2019s information. Two hundred years ago, it was\nestablished that Presidents may be subpoenaed during a federal\ncriminal proceeding,United Statesv.Burr, 25 F.\nCas. 30 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, Cir.\u00a0J.), and\nearlier today we extended that ruling to state criminal\nproceedings,Trumpv.Vance,ante, p. ___.\nNearly fifty years ago, we held that a federal prosecutor could\nobtain information from a President despite assertions of executive\nprivilege,United Statesv.Nixon,418\nU.S. 683(1974), and more recently we ruled that a private\nlitigant could subject a President to a damages suit and\nappropriate discovery obligations in federal court,Clintonv.Jones,520 U.S.\n681(1997).This case is different. Here the President\u2019s\ninformation is sought not by prosecutors or private parties in\nconnection with a particular judicial proceeding, but by committees\nof Congress that have set forth broad legislative objectives.\nCongress and the President\u2014the two political branches established\nby the Constitution\u2014have an ongoing relationship that the Framers\nintended to feature both rivalry and reciprocity. See The\nFederalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison);Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.v.Sawyer,343 U.S.\n579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). That distinctive\naspect necessarily informs our analysis of the question before\nus.IAEach of the three committees sought\noverlapping sets of financial documents, but each supplied\ndifferent justifications for the requests.The House Committee on Financial Services issued\ntwo subpoenas, both on April 11, 2019. App. 128, 154, 226. The\nfirst, issued to Deutsche Bank, seeks the financial information of\nthe President, his children, their immediate family members, and\nseveral affiliated business entities. Specifically, the subpoena\nseeks any document related to account activity, due diligence,\nforeign transactions, business statements, debt schedules,\nstatements of net worth, tax returns, and suspicious activity\nidentified by Deutsche Bank. The second, issued to Capital One,\ndemands similar financial information with respect to more than a\ndozen business entities associated with the President. The Deutsche\nBank subpoena requests materials from \u201c2010 through the present,\u201d\nand the Capital One subpoena covers \u201c2016 through the present,\u201d but\nboth subpoenas impose no time limitations for certain documents,\nsuch as those connected to account openings and due diligence.Id.,at 128, 155.According to the House, the Financial Services\nCommittee issued these subpoenas pursuant to House Resolution 206,\nwhich called for \u201cefforts to close loopholes that allow corruption,\nterrorism, and money laundering to infiltrate our country\u2019s\nfinancial system.\u201d H.\u00a0Res. 206, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., 5\n(Mar. 13, 2019). Such loopholes, the resolution explained, had\nallowed \u201cillicit money, including from Russian oligarchs,\u201d to flow\ninto the United States through \u201canonymous shell companies\u201d using\ninvestments such as \u201cluxury high-end real estate.\u201dId., at\n3. The House also invokes the oversight plan of the Financial\nServices Committee, which stated that the Committee intends to\nreview banking regulation and \u201cexamine the implementation,\neffectiveness, and enforcement\u201d of laws designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism. H.\u00a0R.\u00a0Rep. No.\n116\u201340, p. 84 (2019). The plan further provided that the Committee\nwould \u201cconsider proposals to prevent the abuse of the financial\nsystem\u201d and \u201caddress any vulnerabilities identified\u201d in the real\nestate market.Id., at 85.On the same day as the Financial Services\nCommittee, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued an\nidentical subpoena to Deutsche Bank\u2014albeit for different reasons.\nAccording to the House, the Intelligence Committee subpoenaed\nDeutsche Bank as part of an investigation into foreign efforts to\nundermine the U.\u00a0S. political process. Committee Chairman Adam\nSchiff had described that investigation in a previous statement,\nexplaining that the Committee was examining alleged attempts by\nRussia to influence the 2016 election; potential links between\nRussia and the President\u2019s campaign; and whether the President and\nhis associates had been compromised by foreign actors or interests.\nPress Release, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,\nChairman Schiff Statement on House Intelligence Committee\nInvestigation (Feb. 6, 2019). Chairman Schiff added that the\nCommittee planned \u201cto develop legislation and policy reforms to\nensure the U.\u00a0S. government is better positioned to counter\nfuture efforts to undermine our political process and national\nsecurity.\u201dIbid.Four days after the Financial Services and\nIntelligence Committees, the House Committee on Oversight and\nReform issued another subpoena, this time to the President\u2019s\npersonal accounting firm, Mazars USA, LLP. The subpoena demanded\ninformation related to the President and several affiliated\nbusiness entities from 2011 through 2018, including statements of\nfinancial condition, independent auditors\u2019 reports, financial\nreports, underlying source documents, and communications between\nMazars and the President or his businesses. The subpoena also\nrequested all engagement agreements and contracts \u201c[w]ithout regard\nto time.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in 19\u2013715, p. 230.Chairman Elijah Cummings explained the basis for\nthe subpoena in a memorandum to the Oversight Committee. According\nto the chairman, recent testimony by the President\u2019s former\npersonal attorney Michael Cohen, along with several documents\nprepared by Mazars and supplied by Cohen, raised questions about\nwhether the President had accurately represented his financial\naffairs. Chairman Cummings asserted that the Committee had \u201cfull\nauthority to investigate\u201d whether the President: (1) \u201cmay have\nengaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office,\u201d\n(2)\u00a0\u201chas undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his\nability to make impartial policy decisions,\u201d (3) \u201cis complying with\nthe Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution,\u201d and (4)\u00a0\u201chas\naccurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics\nand other federal entities.\u201d App. in No. 19\u20135142 (CADC), p. 107.\n\u201cThe Committee\u2019s interest in these matters,\u201d Chairman Cummings\nconcluded, \u201cinforms its review of multiple laws and legislative\nproposals under our jurisdiction.\u201dIbid.BPetitioners\u2014the President in his personal\ncapacity, along with his children and affiliated businesses\u2014filed\ntwo suits challenging the subpoenas. They contested the subpoena\nissued by the Oversight Committee in the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia (Mazars, No. 19\u2013715), and the subpoenas\nissued by the Financial Services and Intelligence Committees in the\nSouthern District of New York (Deutsche Bank, No. 19\u2013760).\nIn both cases, petitioners contended that the subpoenas lacked a\nlegitimate legislative purpose and violated the separation of\npowers. The President did not, however, resist the subpoenas by\narguing that any of the requested records were protected by\nexecutive privilege. For relief, petitioners asked for declaratory\njudgments and injunctions preventing Mazars and the banks from\ncomplying with the subpoenas. Although named as defendants, Mazars\nand the banks took no positions on the legal issues in these cases,\nand the House committees intervened to defend the subpoenas.Petitioners\u2019 challenges failed. InMazars, the District Court granted judgment for the House,\n380 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 76 (DC 2019), and the D.\u00a0C. Circuit\naffirmed, 940 F.3d 710 (2019). In upholding the subpoena issued by\nthe Oversight Committee to Mazars, the Court of Appeals found that\nthe subpoena served a \u201cvalid legislative purpose\u201d because the\nrequested information was relevant to reforming financial\ndisclosure requirements for Presidents and presidential candidates.Id., at 726\u2013742 (internal quotation marks omitted). Judge\nRao dissented. As she saw it, the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the subpoena was\ninvestigating alleged illegal conduct by the President, and the\nHouse must pursue such wrongdoing through its impeachment powers,\nnot its legislative powers.Id., at 773\u2013774. Otherwise, the\nHouse could become a \u201croving inquisition over a co-equal branch of\ngovernment.\u201dId., at 748. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit denied\nrehearing en banc over several more dissents. 941 F.3d 1180,\n1180\u20131182 (2019).InDeutsche Bank, the District Court\ndenied a preliminary injunction, 2019 WL 2204898 (SDNY, May 22,\n2019), and the Second Circuit affirmed \u201cin substantial part,\u201d 943\nF.3d 627, 676 (2019). While acknowledging that the subpoenas are\n\u201csurely broad in scope,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that the\nIntelligence Committee properly issued its subpoena to Deutsche\nBank as part of an investigation into alleged foreign influence\nover petitioners and Russian interference with the U.\u00a0S.\npolitical process.Id., at 650, 658\u2013659. That investigation,\nthe court concluded, could inform legislation to combat foreign\nmeddling and strengthen national security.Id., at 658\u2013659,\nand n.\u00a059.As to the subpoenas issued by the Financial\nServices Committee to Deutsche Bank and Capital One, the Court of\nAppeals concluded that they were adequately related to potential\nlegislation on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the\nglobal movement of illicit funds through the real estate market.Id., at 656\u2013659. Rejecting the contention that the subpoenas\nimproperly targeted the President, the court explained in part that\nthe President\u2019s financial dealings with Deutsche Bank made it\n\u201cappropriate\u201d for the House to use him as a \u201ccase study\u201d to\ndetermine \u201cwhether new legislation is needed.\u201dId., at\n662\u2013663, n. 67.[1]Judge Livingston dissented, seeing no \u201cclear\nreason why a congressional investigation aimed generally at closing\nregulatory loopholes in the banking system need focus on over a\ndecade of financial information regarding this President, his\nfamily, and his business affairs.\u201dId., at 687.We granted certiorari in both cases and stayed\nthe judgments below pending our decision. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019).IIAThe question presented is whether the\nsubpoenas exceed the authority of the House under the Constitution.\nHistorically, disputes over congressional demands for presidential\ndocuments have not ended up in court. Instead, they have been\nhashed out in the \u201churly-burly, the give-and-take of the political\nprocess between the legislative and the executive.\u201d Hearings on S.\n2170 et\u00a0al. before the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental\nRelations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 94th\nCong., 1st Sess., 87 (1975) (A. Scalia, Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel).That practice began with George Washington and\nthe early Congress. In 1792, a House committee requested Executive\nBranch documents pertaining to General St. Clair\u2019s campaign against\nthe Indians in the Northwest Territory, which had concluded in an\nutter rout of federal forces when they were caught by surprise near\nthe present-day border between Ohio and Indiana. See T. Taylor,\nGrand Inquest: The Story of Congressional Investigations 19\u201323\n(1955). Since this was the first such request from Congress,\nPresident Washington called a Cabinet meeting, wishing to take care\nthat his response \u201cbe rightly conducted\u201d because it could \u201cbecome a\nprecedent.\u201d 1 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 189 (P. Ford ed.\n1892).The meeting, attended by the likes of Alexander\nHamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Edmund Randolph, and Henry Knox, ended\nwith the Cabinet of \u201cone mind\u201d: The House had authority to\n\u201cinstitute inquiries\u201d and \u201ccall for papers\u201d but the President could\n\u201cexercise a discretion\u201d over disclosures, \u201ccommunicat[ing] such\npapers as the public good would permit\u201d and \u201crefus[ing]\u201d the rest.Id., at 189\u2013190. President Washington then dispatched\nJefferson to speak to individual congressmen and \u201cbring them by\npersuasion into the right channel.\u201dId., at 190. The\ndiscussions were apparently fruitful, as the House later narrowed\nits request and the documents were supplied without recourse to the\ncourts. See 3 Annals of Cong. 536 (1792); Taylor,supra, at\n24.Jefferson, once he became President, followed\nWashington\u2019s precedent. In early 1807, after Jefferson had\ndisclosed that \u201csundry persons\u201d were conspiring to invade Spanish\nterritory in North America with a private army, 16 Annals of Cong.\n686\u2013687, the House requested that the President produce any\ninformation in his possession touching on the conspiracy (except\nfor information that would harm the public interest),id.,\nat 336, 345, 359. Jefferson chose not to divulge the entire\n\u201cvoluminous\u201d correspondence on the subject, explaining that much of\nit was \u201cprivate\u201d or mere \u201crumors\u201d and \u201cneither safety nor justice\u201d\npermitted him to \u201cexpos[e] names\u201d apart from identifying the\nconspiracy\u2019s \u201cprincipal actor\u201d: Aaron Burr.Id., at 39\u201340.\nInstead of the entire correspondence, Jefferson sent Congress\nparticular documents and a special message summarizing the\nconspiracy.Id., at 39\u201343; see generallyVance,ante, at 3\u20134. Neither Congress nor the President asked the\nJudiciary to intervene.[2]Ever since, congressional demands for the\nPresident\u2019s information have been resolved by the political\nbranches without involving this Court. The Reagan and Clinton\npresidencies provide two modern examples:During the Reagan administration, a House\nsubcommittee subpoenaed all documents related to the Department of\nthe Interior\u2019s decision whether to designate Canada a reciprocal\ncountry for purposes of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act. President\nReagan directed that certain documents be withheld because they\nimplicated his confidential relationship with subordinates. While\nwithholding those documents, the administration made \u201crepeated\nefforts\u201d at accommodation through limited disclosures and testimony\nover a period of several months. 6 Op. of Office of Legal Counsel\n751, 780 (1982). Unsatisfied, the subcommittee and its parent\ncommittee eventually voted to hold the Secretary of the Interior in\ncontempt, and an innovative compromise soon followed: All documents\nwere made available, but only for one day with no photocopying,\nminimal notetaking, and no participation by non-Members of\nCongress.Id., at 780\u2013781; see H. R. Rep. No. 97\u2013898, pp.\n3\u20138 (1982).In 1995, a Senate committee subpoenaed notes\ntaken by a White House attorney at a meeting with President\nClinton\u2019s personal lawyers concerning the Whitewater controversy.\nThe President resisted the subpoena on the ground that the notes\nwere protected by attorney-client privilege, leading to \u201clong and\nprotracted\u201d negotiations and a Senate threat to seek judicial\nenforcement of the subpoena. S.\u00a0Rep. No. 104\u2013204, pp. 16\u201317\n(1996). Eventually the parties reached an agreement, whereby\nPresident Clinton avoided the threatened suit, agreed to turn over\nthe notes, and obtained the Senate\u2019s concession that he had not\nwaived any privileges.Ibid.; see L. Fisher, Congressional\nResearch Service, Congressional Investigations: Subpoenas and\nContempt Power 16\u201318 (2003).Congress and the President maintained this\ntradition of negotiation and compromise\u2014without the involvement of\nthis Court\u2014until the present dispute. Indeed, from President\nWashington until now, we have never considered a dispute over a\ncongressional subpoena for the President\u2019s records. And, according\nto the parties, the appellate courts have addressed such a subpoena\nonly once, when a Senate committee subpoenaed President Nixon\nduring the Watergate scandal. Seeinfra, at 13 (discussingSenate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activitiesv.Nixon, 498 F.2d 725 (CADC 1974) (en banc)). In that case,\nthe court refused to enforce the subpoena, and the Senate did not\nseek review by this Court.This dispute therefore represents a significant\ndeparture from historical practice. Although the parties agree that\nthis particular controversy is justiciable, we recognize that it is\nthe first of its kind to reach this Court; that disputes of this\nsort can raise important issues concerning relations between the\nbranches; that related disputes involving congressional efforts to\nseek official Executive Branch information recur on a regular\nbasis, including in the context of deeply partisan controversy; and\nthat Congress and the Executive have nonetheless managed for over\ntwo centuries to resolve such disputes among themselves without the\nbenefit of guidance from us. Such longstanding practice \u201c \u2018is a\nconsideration of great weight\u2019 \u201d in cases concerning \u201cthe\nallocation of power between [the] two elected branches of\nGovernment,\u201d and it imposes on us a duty of care to ensure that we\nnot needlessly disturb \u201cthe compromises and working arrangements\nthat [those] branches .\u00a0.\u00a0. themselves have reached.\u201dNLRBv.Noel Canning,573 U.S.\n513, 524\u2013526 (2014) (quotingThe Pocket Veto Case,279 U.S.\n655, 689 (1929)). With that in mind, we turn to the question\npresented.BCongress has no enumerated constitutional\npower to conduct investigations or issue subpoenas, but we have\nheld that each House has power \u201cto secure needed information\u201d in\norder to legislate.McGrainv.Daugherty,273 U.S.\n135, 161 (1927). This \u201cpower of inquiry\u2014with process to enforce\nit\u2014is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative\nfunction.\u201dId., at 174. Without information, Congress would\nbe shooting in the dark, unable to legislate \u201cwisely or\neffectively.\u201dId., at 175. The congressional power to obtain\ninformation is \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201cindispensable.\u201dWatkinsv.United States,354 U.S.\n178, 187, 215 (1957). It encompasses inquiries into the\nadministration of existing laws, studies of proposed laws, and\n\u201csurveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for\nthe purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them.\u201dId.,\nat 187.Because this power is \u201cjustified solely as an\nadjunct to the legislative process,\u201d it is subject to several\nlimitations.Id., at 197. Most importantly, a congressional\nsubpoena is valid only if it is \u201crelated to, and in furtherance of,\na legitimate task of the Congress.\u201dId., at 187. The\nsubpoena must serve a \u201cvalid legislative purpose,\u201dQuinnv.United States,349 U.S.\n155, 161 (1955); it must \u201cconcern[\u00a0] a subject on which\nlegislation \u2018could be had,\u2019 \u201dEastlandv.United States\nServicemen\u2019s Fund,421 U.S.\n491, 506 (1975) (quotingMcGrain, 273 U.\u00a0S., at\n177).Furthermore, Congress may not issue a subpoena\nfor the purpose of \u201claw enforcement,\u201d because \u201cthose powers are\nassigned under our Constitution to the Executive and the\nJudiciary.\u201dQuinn, 349 U.\u00a0S., at 161. Thus Congress may\nnot use subpoenas to \u201ctry\u201d someone \u201cbefore [a] committee for any\ncrime or wrongdoing.\u201dMcGrain, 273 U.\u00a0S., at 179.\nCongress has no \u201c\u00a0\u2018general\u2019 power to inquire into private\naffairs and compel disclosures,\u201did., at 173\u2013174, and \u201cthere\nis no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure,\u201dWatkins, 354 U.\u00a0S., at 200. \u201cInvestigations conducted\nsolely for the personal aggrandizement of the investigators or to\n\u2018punish\u2019 those investigated are indefensible.\u201dId., at\n187.Finally, recipients of legislative subpoenas\nretain their constitutional rights throughout the course of an\ninvestigation. Seeid., at 188, 198. And recipients have\nlong been understood to retain common law and constitutional\nprivileges with respect to certain materials, such as\nattorney-client communications and governmental communications\nprotected by executive privilege. See,e.g., Congressional\nResearch Service,supra,at 16\u201318 (attorney-client\nprivilege);Senate Select Committee, 498 F.\u00a02d, at 727,\n730\u2013731 (executive privilege).CThe President contends, as does the Solicitor\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the United States, that the usual\nrules for congressional subpoenas do not govern here because the\nPresident\u2019s papers are at issue. They argue for a more demanding\nstandard based in large part on cases involving the Nixon\ntapes\u2014recordings of conversations between President Nixon and close\nadvisers discussing the break-in at the Democratic National\nCommittee\u2019s headquarters at the Watergate complex. The tapes were\nsubpoenaed by a Senate committee and the Special Prosecutor\ninvestigating the break-in, prompting President Nixon to invoke\nexecutive privilege and leading to two cases addressing the showing\nnecessary to require the President to comply with the subpoenas.\nSeeNixon,418\nU.S. 683;Senate Select Committee, 498 F.2d 725.Those cases, the President and the Solicitor\nGeneral now contend, establish the standard that should govern the\nHouse subpoenas here. QuotingNixon, the President asserts\nthat the House must establish a \u201cdemonstrated, specific need\u201d for\nthe financial information, just as the Watergate special prosecutor\nwas required to do in order to obtain the tapes. 418 U.\u00a0S., at\n713. And drawing onSenate Select Committee\u2014the D.\u00a0C.\nCircuit case refusing to enforce the Senate subpoena for the\ntapes\u2014the President and the Solicitor General argue that the House\nmust show that the financial information is \u201cdemonstrably critical\u201d\nto its legislative purpose. 498 F.\u00a02d, at 731.We disagree that these demanding standards apply\nhere. Unlike the cases before us,NixonandSenate Select\nCommitteeinvolved Oval Office communications over which the\nPresident asserted executive privilege. That privilege safeguards\nthe public interest in candid, confidential deliberations within\nthe Executive Branch; it is \u201cfundamental to the operation of\nGovernment.\u201dNixon, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 708. As a result,\ninformation subject to executive privilege deserves \u201cthe greatest\nprotection consistent with the fair administration of justice.\u201dId., at 715. We decline to transplant that protection root\nand branch to cases involving nonprivileged, private information,\nwhich by definition does not implicate sensitive Executive Branch\ndeliberations.The standards proposed by the President and the\nSolicitor General\u2014if applied outside the context of privileged\ninformation\u2014would risk seriously impeding Congress in carrying out\nits responsibilities. The President and the Solicitor General would\napply the same exacting standards toallsubpoenas for the\nPresident\u2019s information, without recognizing distinctions between\nprivileged and nonprivileged information, between official and\npersonal information, or between various legislative objectives.\nSuch a categorical approach would represent a significant departure\nfrom the longstanding way of doing business between the branches,\ngiving short shrift to Congress\u2019s important interests in conducting\ninquiries to obtain the information it needs to legislate\neffectively. Confounding the legislature in that effort would be\ncontrary to the principle that:\u201cIt is the proper duty of a representative\nbody to look diligently into every affair of government and to talk\nmuch about what it sees. It is meant to be the eyes and the voice,\nand to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents. Unless\nCongress have and use every means of acquainting itself with the\nacts and the disposition of the administrative agents of the\ngovernment, the country must be helpless to learn how it is being\nserved.\u201dUnited Statesv.Rumely,345 U.S.\n41, 43 (1953) (internal quotation marks omitted).Legislative inquiries might involve the\nPresident in appropriate cases; as noted, Congress\u2019s\nresponsibilities extend to \u201cevery affair of government.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the\nPresident\u2019s approach does not take adequate account of these\nsignificant congressional interests, we do not adopt it.DThe House meanwhile would have us ignore that\nthese suits involve the President. Invoking our precedents\nconcerning investigations that did not target the President\u2019s\npapers, the House urges us to uphold its subpoenas because they\n\u201crelate[\u00a0] to a valid legislative purpose\u201d or \u201cconcern[\u00a0]\na subject on which legislation could be had.\u201d Brief for Respondent\n46 (quotingBarenblattv.United States,360 U.S.\n109, 127 (1959), andEastland, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 506).\nThat approach is appropriate, the House argues, because the cases\nbefore us are not \u201cmomentous separation-of-powers disputes.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 1.Largely following the House\u2019s lead, the courts\nbelow treated these cases much like any other, applying precedents\nthat do not involve the President\u2019s papers. See 943 F.\u00a03d, at\n656\u2013670; 940 F.\u00a03d, at 724\u2013742. The Second Circuit concluded\nthat \u201cthis case does not concern separation of powers\u201d because the\nHouse seeks personal documents and the President sued in his\npersonal capacity. 943 F.\u00a03d, at 669. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit,\nfor its part, recognized that \u201cseparation-of-powers concerns still\nlinger in the air,\u201d and therefore it did not afford deference to\nthe House. 940 F.\u00a03d, at 725\u2013726. But, because the House\nsought only personal documents, the court concluded that the case\n\u201cpresent[ed] no direct interbranch dispute.\u201dIbid.The House\u2019s approach fails to take adequate\naccount of the significant separation of powers issues raised by\ncongressional subpoenas for the President\u2019s information. Congress\nand the President have an ongoing institutional relationship as the\n\u201copposite and rival\u201d political branches established by the\nConstitution. The Federalist No. 51, at 349. As a result,\ncongressional subpoenas directed at the President differ markedly\nfrom congressional subpoenas we have previously reviewed,e.g.,Barenblatt, 360 U.\u00a0S., at 127;Eastland, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 506, and they bear little\nresemblance to criminal subpoenas issued to the President in the\ncourse of a specific investigation, seeVance,ante,\np. ___;Nixon,418\nU.S. 683. Unlike those subpoenas, congressional subpoenas for\nthe President\u2019s information unavoidably pit the political branches\nagainst one another. Cf.In\u00a0re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d\n729, 753 (CADC 1997) (\u201cThe President\u2019s ability to withhold\ninformation from Congress implicates different constitutional\nconsiderations than the President\u2019s ability to withhold evidence in\njudicial proceedings.\u201d).Far from accounting for separation of powers\nconcerns, the House\u2019s approach aggravates them by leaving\nessentially no limits on the congressional power to subpoena the\nPresident\u2019s personal records. Any personal paper possessed by a\nPresident could potentially \u201crelate to\u201d a conceivable subject of\nlegislation, for Congress has broad legislative powers that touch a\nvast number of subjects. Brief for Respondent 46. The President\u2019s\nfinancial records could relate to economic reform, medical records\nto health reform, school transcripts to education reform, and so\non. Indeed, at argument, the House was unable to identifyanytype of information that lacks some relation to\npotential legislation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\u201353, 62\u201365.Without limits on its subpoena powers, Congress\ncould \u201cexert an imperious controul\u201d over the Executive Branch and\naggrandize itself at the President\u2019s expense, just as the Framers\nfeared. The Federalist No. 71, at 484 (A. Hamilton); seeid., No. 48, at 332\u2013333 (J. Madison);Bowsherv.Synar,478 U.S.\n714, 721\u2013722, 727 (1986). And a limitless subpoena power would\ntransform the \u201cestablished practice\u201d of the political branches.Noel Canning, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 524 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Instead of negotiating over information requests,\nCongress could simply walk away from the bargaining table and\ncompel compliance in court.The House and the courts below suggest that\nthese separation of powers concerns are not fully implicated by the\nparticular subpoenas here, but we disagree. We would have to be\n\u201cblind\u201d not to see what \u201c[a]ll others can see and understand\u201d: that\nthe subpoenas do not represent a run-of-the-mill legislative effort\nbut rather a clash between rival branches of government over\nrecords of intense political interest for all involved.Rumely, 345 U.\u00a0S., at 44 (quotingChild Labor Tax\nCase,259 U.S.\n20, 37 (1922) (Taft, C.\u00a0J.)).The interbranch conflict here does not vanish\nsimply because the subpoenas seek personal papers or because the\nPresident sued in his personal capacity. The President is the only\nperson who alone composes a branch of government. As a result,\nthere is not always a clear line between his personal and official\naffairs. \u201cThe interest of the man\u201d is often \u201cconnected with the\nconstitutional rights of the place.\u201d The Federalist No. 51, at 349.\nGiven the close connection between the Office of the President and\nits occupant, congressional demands for the President\u2019s papers can\nimplicate the relationship between the branches regardless whether\nthose papers are personal or official. Either way, a demand may aim\nto harass the President or render him \u201ccomplaisan[t] to the humors\nof the Legislature.\u201dId., No. 71, at 483. In fact, a\nsubpoena for personal papers may pose a heightened risk of such\nimpermissible purposes, precisely because of the documents\u2019\npersonal nature and their less evident connection to a legislative\ntask. No one can say that the controversy here is less significant\nto the relationship between the branches simply because it involves\npersonal papers. Quite the opposite. That appears to be what makes\nthe matter of such great consequence to the President and\nCongress.In addition, separation of powers concerns are\nno less palpable here simply because the subpoenas were issued to\nthird parties. Congressional demands for the President\u2019s\ninformation present an interbranch conflict no matter where the\ninformation is held\u2014it is, after all, the President\u2019s information.\nWere it otherwise, Congress could sidestep constitutional\nrequirements any time a President\u2019s information is entrusted to a\nthird party\u2014as occurs with rapidly increasing frequency. Cf.Carpenterv.United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___,\n___ (2018) (slip op., at 15, 17). Indeed, Congress could declare\nopen season on the President\u2019s information held by schools,\narchives, internet service providers, e-mail clients, and financial\ninstitutions. The Constitution does not tolerate such ready\nevasion; it \u201cdeals with substance, not shadows.\u201dCummingsv.Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867).ECongressional subpoenas for the President\u2019s\npersonal information implicate weighty concerns regarding the\nseparation of powers. Neither side, however, identifies an approach\nthat accounts for these concerns. For more than two centuries, the\npolitical branches have resolved information disputes using the\nwide variety of means that the Constitution puts at their disposal.\nThe nature of such interactions would be transformed by judicial\nenforcement of either of the approaches suggested by the parties,\neroding a \u201c[d]eeply embedded traditional way[\u00a0] of conducting\ngovernment.\u201dYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co., 343\nU.\u00a0S., at 610 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).A balanced approach is necessary, one that takes\na \u201cconsiderable impression\u201d from \u201cthe practice of the government,\u201dMcCullochv.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); seeNoel Canning, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 524\u2013526, and \u201cresist[s]\u201d\nthe \u201cpressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to\nexceed the outer limits of its power,\u201dINSv.Chadha,462 U.S.\n919, 951 (1983). We therefore conclude that, in assessing\nwhether a subpoena directed at the President\u2019s personal information\nis \u201crelated to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of the\nCongress,\u201dWatkins, 354 U.\u00a0S., at 187, courts must\nperform a careful analysis that takes adequate account of the\nseparation of powers principles at stake, including both the\nsignificant legislative interests of Congress and the \u201cunique\nposition\u201d of the President,Clinton, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 698\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Several special considerations\ninform this analysis.First, courts should carefully assess whether\nthe asserted legislative purpose warrants the significant step of\ninvolving the President and his papers. \u201c \u2018[O]ccasion[s] for\nconstitutional confrontation between the two branches\u2019 should be\navoided whenever possible.\u201dCheneyv.United States Dist.\nCourt for D.\u00a0C.,542 U.S.\n367, 389\u2013390 (2004) (quotingNixon, 418 U.\u00a0S., at\n692). Congress may not rely on the President\u2019s information if other\nsources could reasonably provide Congress the information it needs\nin light of its particular legislative objective. The President\u2019s\nunique constitutional position means that Congress may not look to\nhim as a \u201ccase study\u201d for general legislation. Cf. 943 F.\u00a03d,\nat 662\u2013663, n. 67.Unlike in criminal proceedings, where \u201c[t]he\nvery integrity of the judicial system\u201d would be undermined without\n\u201cfull disclosure of all the facts,\u201dNixon, 418 U. S., at\n709, efforts to craft legislation involve predictive policy\njudgments that are \u201cnot hamper[ed] .\u00a0.\u00a0. in quite the\nsame way\u201d when every scrap of potentially relevant evidence is not\navailable,Cheney, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 384; seeSenate\nSelect Committee, 498 F. 2d, at 732. While we certainly\nrecognize Congress\u2019s important interests in obtaining information\nthrough appropriate inquiries, those interests are not sufficiently\npowerful to justify access to the President\u2019s personal papers when\nother sources could provide Congress the information it needs.Second, to narrow the scope of possible conflict\nbetween the branches, courts should insist on a subpoena no broader\nthan reasonably necessary to support Congress\u2019s legislative\nobjective. The specificity of the subpoena\u2019s request \u201cserves as an\nimportant safeguard against unnecessary intrusion into the\noperation of the Office of the President.\u201dCheney, 542\nU.\u00a0S., at 387.Third, courts should be attentive to the nature\nof the evidence offered by Congress to establish that a subpoena\nadvances a valid legislative purpose. The more detailed and\nsubstantial the evidence of Congress\u2019s legislative purpose, the\nbetter. SeeWatkins, 354 U.\u00a0S., at 201, 205 (preferring\nsuch evidence over \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cloosely worded\u201d evidence of\nCongress\u2019s purpose). That is particularly true when Congress\ncontemplates legislation that raises sensitive constitutional\nissues, such as legislation concerning the Presidency. In such\ncases, it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to conclude that a subpoena is designed\nto advance a valid legislative purpose unless Congress adequately\nidentifies its aims and explains why the President\u2019s information\nwill advance its consideration of the possible legislation.Id., at 205\u2013206, 214\u2013215.Fourth, courts should be careful to assess the\nburdens imposed on the President by a subpoena. We have held that\nburdens on the President\u2019s time and attention stemming from\njudicial process and litigation, without more, generally do not\ncross constitutional lines. SeeVance,ante,at\n12\u201314;Clinton, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 704\u2013705. But burdens\nimposed by a congressional subpoena should be carefully\nscrutinized, for they stem from a rival political branch that has\nan ongoing relationship with the President and incentives to use\nsubpoenas for institutional advantage.Other considerations may be pertinent as well;\none case every two centuries does not afford enough experience for\nan exhaustive list.When Congress seeks information \u201cneeded for\nintelligent legislative action,\u201d it \u201cunquestionably\u201d remains \u201cthe\nduty ofallcitizens to cooperate.\u201dWatkins, 354\nU.\u00a0S., at 187 (emphasis added). Congressional subpoenas for\ninformation from the President, however, implicate special concerns\nregarding the separation of powers. The courts below did not take\nadequate account of those concerns. The judgments of the Courts of\nAppeals for the D.\u00a0C. Circuit and the Second Circuit are\nvacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The Court of Appeals\ndirected a \u201climited\u201d remand for the District Court to consider\nwhether it was necessary to disclose certain \u201csensitive personal\ndetails\u201d (such as documents reflecting medical services received by\nemployees of the Trump business entities) and a \u201cfew\u201d documents\nthat might not relate to the committees\u2019 legislative purposes. 943\nF.3d 627, 667\u2013668, 675 (2019). The Court of Appeals ordered that\nall other documents be \u201cpromptly transmitted\u201d to the committees.Id., at 669.2By contrast, later that\nsummer, the Judiciarywascalled on to resolve whether\nPresident Jefferson could be issued a subpoenaduces tecumarising from Burr\u2019s criminal trial.
