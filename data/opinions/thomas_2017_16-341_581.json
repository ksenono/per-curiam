The patent venue statute, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400(b), provides that \u201c[a]ny civil action for\npatent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where\nthe defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of\ninfringement and has a regular and established place of business.\u201d\nInFourco Glass Co.v.Transmirra Products Corp., 353\nU.\u00a0S. 222, 226 (1957) , this Court concluded that for purposes\nof \u00a71400(b) a domestic corporation \u201cresides\u201d only in its State of\nincorporation.In reaching that conclusion, the Court rejected\nthe argument that \u00a71400(b) incorporates the broader definition of\ncorporate \u201cresidence\u201d contained in the general venue statute, 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(c). 353 U.\u00a0S., at 228. Congress has\nnot amended \u00a71400(b) since this Court construed it inFourco, but it has amended \u00a71391 twice. Section 1391 now\nprovides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d and \u201c[f]or\nall venue purposes,\u201d a corporation \u201cshall be deemed to reside, if a\ndefendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is\nsubject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction with respect to the\ncivil action in question.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71391(a), (c). The issue in this case\nis whether that definition supplants the definition announced inFourcoand allows a plaintiff to bring a patent infringement\nlawsuit against a corporation in any district in which the\ncorporation is subject to personal jurisdiction. We conclude that\nthe amendments to \u00a71391 did not modify the meaning of \u00a71400(b) as\ninterpreted byFourco. We therefore hold that a domestic\ncorporation \u201cresides\u201d only in its State of incorporation for\npurposes of the patent venue statute.IPetitioner, which is organized under Indiana\nlaw and headquartered in Indiana, manufactures flavored drink\nmixes.[1] Respondent, which is\norganized under Delaware law and has its principal place of\nbusiness in Illinois, is a competitor in the same market. As\nrelevant here, respondent sued petitioner in the District Court for\nthe District of Delaware, alleging that petitioner\u2019s products\ninfringed one of respondent\u2019s patents. Although petitioner is not\nregistered to conduct business in Delaware and has no meaningful\nlocal presence there, it does ship the al-legedly infringing\nproducts into the State.Petitioner moved to dismiss the case or transfer\nvenue to the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,\narguing that venue was improper in Delaware. See 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71406. CitingFourco\u2019s holding that a\ncorporation resides only in its State of incorporation for patent\ninfringement suits, petitioner argued that it did not \u201cresid[e]\u201d in\nDelaware under the first clause of \u00a71400(b). It further argued that\nit had no \u201cregular and established place of business\u201d in Delaware\nunder the second clause of \u00a71400(b). Relying on Circuit precedent,\nthe District Court rejected these arguments, 2015 WL 5613160 (D\nDel., Sept. 24, 2015), and the Federal Circuit denied a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus,In\u00a0re TC Heartland LLC, 821\nF.\u00a03d 1338 (2016). The Federal Circuit concluded that\nsubsequent statutory amendments had effectively amended \u00a71400(b) as\nconstrued inFourco, with the result that \u00a71391(c) now\nsupplies the definition of \u201cresides\u201d in \u00a71400(b). 821 F.\u00a03d,\nat 1341\u20131343. Under this logic, because the District of Delaware\ncould exercise personal jurisdiction over petitioner, petitioner\nresided in Delaware under \u00a71391(c) and, therefore, under \u00a71400(b).\nWe granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now\nreverse.IIAThe history of the relevant statutes provides\nimportant context for the issue in this case. The Judiciary Act of\n1789 permitted a plaintiff to file suit in a federal district court\nif the defendant was \u201can inhabitant\u201d of that district or could be\n\u201cfound\u201d for service of process in that district. Act of Sept. 24,\n1789, \u00a711, 1Stat. 79. The Act covered patent cases as well as other\ncivil suits.Stonite Products Co.v.Melvin Lloyd\nCo., 315 U.\u00a0S. 561, 563 (1942) . In 1887, Congress amended\nthe statute to permit suit only in the district of which the\ndefendant was an inhabitant or, in diversity cases, of which either\nthe plaintiff or defendant was an inhabitant. See Act of Mar. 3,\n1887, \u00a71, 24 Stat. 552; see alsoStonite,supra, at\n563\u2013564.This Court\u2019s decision inInre\nHohorst, 150 U.\u00a0S. 653 \u2013662 (1893), arguably suggested\nthat the 1887 Act did not apply to patent cases. As a result, while\nsome courts continued to apply the Act to patent cases, others\nrefused to do so and instead permitted plaintiffs to bring suit (in\nline with the pre-1887 regime) anywhere a defendant could be found\nfor service of process. SeeStonite,supra, at\n564\u2013565. In 1897, Congress resolved the confusion by enacting a\npatent specific venue statute. See Act of Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 395,\n29Stat. 695. In so doing, it \u201cplaced pat-ent infringement cases in\na class by themselves, outside the scope of general venue\nlegislation.\u201dBrunette Machine Works, Ltd.v.Kockum\nIndustries, Inc., 406 U.\u00a0S. 706, 713 (1972) . This new\nstatute (\u00a71400(b)\u2019s predecessor) permitted suit in the district of\nwhich the defendant was an \u201cinhabitant,\u201d or a district in which the\ndefendant both maintained a \u201cregular and established place of\nbusiness\u201d and committed an act of infringement. 29Stat. 695. At the\ntime, a corporation was understood to \u201cinhabit\u201donlythe\nState in which it was incorporated.Shawv.Quincy Mining\nCo., 145 U.\u00a0S. 444 \u2013450 (1892).The Court addressed the scope of \u00a71400(b)\u2019s\npredecessor inStonite. In that case, the two defendants\ninhabited different districts within a single State. The plaintiff\nsought to sue them both in the same district, invoking a then\ngoverning general venue statute that, if applicable, permitted it\nto do so. 315 U.\u00a0S., at 562\u2013563. This Court rejected the\nplaintiff\u2019s venue choice on the ground that the patent venue\nstatute constituted \u201cthe exclusive provision controlling venue in\npatent infringement proceedings\u201d and thus was not supplemented or\nmodified by the general venue provisions.Id.,at 563. In\nthe Court\u2019s view, the patent venue statute \u201cwas adopted to define\nthe exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce\npatent rights,\u201d a purpose that would be undermined by interpreting\nit \u201cto dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue\nof civil suits.\u201dId., at 565\u2013566. The Court thus held that\nthe patent venue statute \u201calone should control venue in patent\ninfringement proceedings.\u201dId.,at 566.In 1948, Congress recodified the patent venue\nstatute as \u00a71400(b). See Act of June 25, 1948, 62Stat. 936. The\nrecodified provision, which remains unaltered today, states that\n\u201c[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the\njudicial district where the defendant resides, or where the\ndefendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and\nestablished place of business.\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400(b)\n(1952 ed.). This version differs from the previous one in that it\nuses \u201cresides\u201d instead of \u201cinhabit[s].\u201d At the same time, Congress\nalso enacted the general venue statute, \u00a71391, which defined\n\u201cresidence\u201d for corporate defendants. That provision stated that\n\u201c[a] corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it\nis incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business,\nand such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of\nsuch corporation for venue purposes.\u201d \u00a71391(c) (1952 ed.).Following the 1948 legislation, courts reached\ndiffering conclusions regarding whether \u00a71400(b)\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cresides\u201d incorporated \u00a71391(c)\u2019s definition of \u201cresidence.\u201d SeeFourco, 353 U.\u00a0S., at 224, n.\u00a03 (listing cases).\nInFourco, this Court reviewed a decision of the Second\nCircuitholding that \u00a71391(c) defined residence for purposes of\n\u00a71400(b), \u201cjust as that definition is properly .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nincorporated into other sections of the venue chapter.\u201dTrans-mirra Prods. Corp.v.Fourco Glass Co., 233\nF.\u00a02d 885, 886 (1956). This Court squarely rejected that\ninterpretation, reaffirmingStonite\u2019s holding that \u00a71400(b)\n\u201cis the sole and exclusive provision controlling venue in patent\ninfringement actions, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not to be supplemented\nby .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u00a71391(c).\u201d 353 U.\u00a0S., at 229. The Court\nobserved that Congress enacted \u00a71400(b) as a standalone venue\nstatute and that nothing in the 1948 recodification evidenced an\nintent to alter that status. The fact that \u00a71391(c) by \u201cits terms\u201d\nembraced \u201call actions\u201d was not enough to overcome the fundamental\npoint that Congress designed \u00a71400(b) to be \u201ccomplete, independent\nand alone controlling in its sphere.\u201dId., at 228.The Court also concluded that \u201cresides\u201d in the\nrecodified version of \u00a71400(b) bore the same meaning as\n\u201cinhabit[s]\u201d in the pre-1948 version. Seeid., at 226\n(\u201c[T]he [w]ords \u2018inhabitant\u2019 and \u2018resident,\u2019 as respects venue, are\nsynonymous\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The substitution\nof \u201cresides\u201d for \u201cinhabit[s]\u201d thus did not suggest any alteration\nin the venue rules for corporations in patent cases. Accordingly,\n\u00a71400(b) continued to apply to domestic corporations in the same\nway it always had: They were subject to venue only in their States\nof incorporation. Seeibid.(The use of \u201cresides\u201d \u201cnegat[es]\nany intention to make corporations suable, in patent infringement\ncases, where they are merely \u2018doing business,\u2019 because those\nsynonymous words [\u201cinhabitant\u201d and \u201cresident\u201d] meandomicileand, in respect of corporations, mean the state of incorporation\nonly\u201d).BThis landscape remained effectively unchanged\nuntil 1988, when Congress amended the general venue statute,\n\u00a71391(c), to provide that \u201c[f]or purposes of venue under this\nchapter, a defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to\nreside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal\njurisdiction at the time the action is commenced.\u201d Judicial\nImprovements and Access to Justice Act, \u00a71013(a), 102Stat. 4669.\nThe Federal Circuit inVE Holding Corp.v.Johnson Gas\nAppliance Co., 917 F.\u00a02d 1574 (1990), announced its view\nof the effect of this amendment on the meaning of the patent venue\nstatute. The court reasoned that the phrase \u201c[f]or purposes of\nvenue under this chapter\u201d was \u201cexact and classic language of\nincorporation,\u201did., at 1579, and that \u00a71391(c) accord-ingly\nestablished the definition for all other venue statutes under the\nsame \u201cchapter.\u201dId.,at 1580. Because \u00a71400(b) fell within\nthe relevant chapter, the Federal Circuit concluded that \u00a71391(c),\n\u201con its face,\u201d \u201cclearly applies to \u00a71400(b), and thus redefines the\nmeaning of the term \u2018resides\u2019 in that section.\u201dId., at\n1578.FollowingVE Holding, no new developments\noccurred until Congress adopted the current version of \u00a71391 in\n2011 (again leaving \u00a71400(b) unaltered). See Federal Courts\nJurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011, \u00a7202, 125Stat.\n763. Section 1391(a) now provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise\nprovided by law,\u201d \u201cthis section shall govern the venue of all civil\nactions brought in district courts of the United States.\u201d And\n\u00a71391(c)(2), in turn, provides that, \u201c[f]or all venue purposes,\u201d\ncertain entities, \u201cwhether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to\nreside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such\ndefendant is subject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction with\nrespect to the civil action in question.\u201d In its decision below,\nthe Federal Circuit reaffirmedVE Holding, reasoning that\nthe 2011 amendments provided no basis to reconsider its prior\ndecision.IIIWe reverse the Federal Circuit. InFourco, this Court definitively and unambiguously held that\nthe word \u201creside[nce]\u201d in \u00a71400(b) has a particular meaning as\napplied to domestic[2]\ncorporations: It refers only to the State of incorporation.\nCongress has not amended \u00a71400(b) sinceFourco, and neither\nparty asks us to reconsider our holding in that case. Accordingly,\nthe only question we must answer is whether Congress changed the\nmeaning of \u00a71400(b) when it amended \u00a71391. When Congress intends to\neffect a change of that kind, it ordinarily provides a relatively\nclear indication of its intent in the text of the amended\nprovision. SeeUnited Statesv.Madigan, 300\nU.\u00a0S. 500, 506 (1937) (\u201c[T]he modification by implication of\nthe settled construction of an earlier and different section is not\nfavored\u201d); A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 331 (2012) (\u201cA\nclear, authoritative judicial holding on the meaning of a\nparticular provision should not be cast in doubt and subjected to\nchallenge whenever a related though not utterly inconsistent\nprovision is adopted in the same statute or even in an affiliated\nstatute\u201d).The current version of \u00a71391 does not contain\nany indication that Congress intended to alter the meaning of\n\u00a71400(b) as interpreted inFourco. Although the current\nversion of \u00a71391(c) provides a default rule that applies \u201c[f]or all\nvenue purposes,\u201d the version at issue inFourcosimilarly\nprovided a default rule that applied \u201cfor venue purposes.\u201d 353\nU.\u00a0S., at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this\ncontext, we do not see any material difference between the two\nphrasings. SeePure Oil Co.v.Suarez, 384 U.\u00a0S.\n202 \u2013205 (1966) (construing \u201c\u00a0\u2018for venue purposes\u2019\u00a0\u201d to\ncover \u201call venue statutes\u201d). Respondent argues that \u201c\u00a0\u2018all\nvenue purposes\u2019 means \u2018all venue purposes\u2019\u2014not \u2018all venue purposesexceptfor patentvenue.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Respondent 21. The\nplaintiffs inFourcoadvanced the same argument. See 353\nU.\u00a0S., at 228 (\u201cThe main thrust of respondents\u2019 argument is\nthat \u00a71391(c) is clear and unambiguous and that its terms include\nall actions\u2014including patent infringement actions\u201d). This Court was\nnot persuaded then, and the addition of the word \u201call\u201d to the\nalready comprehensive provision does not suggest that Congress\nintended for us to reconsider that conclusion.This particular argument is even weaker under\nthe current version of \u00a71391 than it was under the provision in\nplace at the time ofFourco, because the current provision\nincludes a saving clause expressly stating that it does not apply\nwhen \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d On its face, the version of\n\u00a71391(c) at issue inFourcoincluded no exceptions, yet this\nCourt still held that \u201cresides\u201d in \u00a71400(b) retained its original\nmeaning contrary to \u00a71391(c)\u2019s default definition.Fourco\u2019s\nholding rests on even firmer footing now that \u00a71391\u2019s saving clause\nexpressly contemplates that certain venue statutes may retain\ndefinitions of \u201cresides\u201d that conflict with its default definition.\nIn short, the saving clause makes explicit the qualification that\nthis Court previously found implicit in the statute. SeePure\nOil,supra,at 205 (interpreting earlier version of\n\u00a71391 to apply \u201cto all venue statutes using residence as a\ncriterion, at least in the absence of contrary restrictive\nindications in any such statute\u201d). Respondent suggests that the\nsaving clause in \u00a71391(a) does not apply to the definitional\nprovisions in \u00a71391(c), Brief for Respondent 31\u201332, but that\ninterpretation is belied by the text of \u00a71391(a), which makes clear\nthat the saving clause applies to the entire \u201csection.\u201d See\n\u00a71391(a)(1) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law\u2014 .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nthissectionshall govern the venue of all civil actions\u201d\n(emphasis added)).Finally, there is no indication that Congress in\n2011 ratified the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision inVE Holding.\nIf anything, the 2011 amendments undermine that decision\u2019s\nrationale. As petitioner points out,VE Holdingrelied\nheavily\u2014indeed, almost exclusively\u2014on Congress\u2019 decision in 1988 to\nreplace \u201cfor venue purposes\u201d with \u201c[f]or purposes of venueunder\nthis chapter\u201d (emphasis added) in \u00a71391(c). Congress deleted\n\u201cunder this chapter\u201d in 2011 and worded the current version of\n\u00a71391(c) almost identically to the original version of the statute.\nCompare \u00a71391(c) (2012 ed.) (\u201c[f]or all venue purposes\u201d) with\n\u00a71391(c) (1952 ed.) (\u201cfor venue purposes\u201d). In short, nothing in\nthe text suggests congressional approval ofVE Holding.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*As applied to domestic corporations,\n\u201creside[nce]\u201d in \u00a71400(b) refers only to the State of\nincorporation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.Notes1The complaint alleged\nthat petitioner is a corporation, and petitioner admitted this\nallegation in its answer. See App. 11a, 60a. Similarly, the\npetition for certiorari sought review on the question of\n\u201ccorporate\u201d residence. See Pet. for Cert. i. In their briefs before\nthis Court, how-ever, the parties suggest that petitioner is, in\nfact, an unincorporated entity. See Brief for Respondent 9,\nn.\u00a04 (the complaint\u2019s allegation was \u201capparently\ninaccurat[e]\u201d); Reply Brief 4. Because this case comes to us at the\npleading stage and has been litigated on the understanding that\npetitioner is a corporation, we confine our analysis to the proper\nvenue for corporations. We leave further consideration of the issue\nof petitioner\u2019s legal status to the courts below on\nremand.2The parties dispute the\nimplications of petitioner\u2019s argument for foreign corporations. We\ndo not here address that question, nor do we express any opinion on\nthis Court\u2019s holding inBrunette Machine Works, Ltd.v.Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.\u00a0S. 706 (1972)\n(determining proper venue for foreign corporation under then\nexisting statutory regime).",
