S. 1(1976)(per curiam). See Brief for William H. Sorrell et\u00a0al.\nin Nos. 04\u20131528 and 04\u20131530, pp. 15\u201328 (hereinafter Sorrell Brief);\nBrief for Vermont Public Interest Research Group et\u00a0al. in\nNos. 04\u20131528 and 04\u20131530, pp. 5\u201336 (hereinafter VPIRG Brief). Only\nas a backup argument, an afterthought almost, do respondents make a\nnaked plea for us to \u201crevisitBuckley.\u201d Sorrell Brief 28;\nVPIRG Brief 36. This is fairly incongruous, given that respondents\u2019\ndefense of Vermont\u2019s contribution limits rests squarely onBuckleyand later decisions that built onBuckley, and yet respondents fail to explain why it would\nbe appropriate to reexamine only one part of the holding inBuckley. More to the point, respondents fail to discuss\nthe doctrine ofstare decisisor the Court\u2019s cases\nelaborating on the circumstances in which it is appropriate to\nreconsider a prior constitutional decision. Indeed, only once in 99\npages of briefing from respondents do the words \u201cstare\ndecisis\u201d appear, and that reference is in connection withcontributionlimits. See Sorrell Brief 31. Such an\nincomplete presentation is reason enough to refuse respondents\u2019\ninvitation to reexamineBuckley. SeeUnited\nStatesv.International Business Machines Corp.,517 U. S. 843,\n856 (1996).Whether or not a case can be made for\nreexaminingBuckleyin whole or in part, what matters is\nthat respondents do not do so here, and so I think it unnecessary\nto reach the issue.",
