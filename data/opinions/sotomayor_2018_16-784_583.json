Those powers,\nreferred to as \u201cavoiding powers,\u201d are not without limits, however,\nas the Code sets out a number of exceptions. The operation of one\nsuch exception, the securities safe harbor, 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7546(e), is at issue in this case. Specifically, this Court is\nasked to determine how the safe harbor operates in the context of a\ntransfer that was executed via one or more transactions,e.g.,a transfer from A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D that was executed via\nB and C as intermediaries, such that the component parts of the\ntransfer include A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0B\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D. If a\ntrustee seeks to avoid the A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D transfer, and the\n\u00a7546(e) safe harbor is invoked as a defense, the question becomes:\nWhen determining whether the \u00a7546(e) securities safe harbor saves\nthe transfer from avoidance, should courts look to the transfer\nthat the trustee seeks to avoid (i.e.,A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D) to\ndetermine whether that transfer meets the safe-harbor criteria, or\nshould courts look also to any component parts of the overarching\ntransfer (i.e.,A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0B\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D)? The Court concludes\nthat the plain meaning of \u00a7546(e) dictates that the only relevant\ntransfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the\ntrustee seeks to avoid.IABecause the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor operates as a\nlimit to the general avoiding powers of a bankruptcy\ntrustee,[1] we begin with a\nreview of those powers. Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code affords\nbankruptcy trustees the authority to \u201cse[t] aside certain types of\ntransfers .\u00a0.\u00a0. and .\u00a0.\u00a0. recaptur[e] the value\nof those avoided transfers for the benefit of the estate.\u201d Tabb\n\u00a76.2, p. 474. These avoiding powers \u201chelp implement the core\nprinciples of bankruptcy.\u201dId.,\u00a76.1, at 468. For example,\nsome \u201cdeter the race of diligence of creditors to dismember the\ndebtor before bankruptcy\u201d and promote \u201cequality of distribution.\u201dUnion Bankv.Wolas, 502 U.\u00a0S. 151, 162 (1991)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tabb \u00a76.2. Others set\naside transfers that \u201cunfairly or improperly deplete\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. assets or .\u00a0.\u00a0. dilute the claims against\nthose assets.\u201d 5 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6548.01, p. 548\u201310 (16th ed.\n2017); see also Tabb \u00a76.2, at 475 (noting that some avoiding powers\nare designed \u201cto ensure that the debtor deals fairly with its\ncreditors\u201d).Sections 544 through 553 of the Code outline the\ncircumstances under which a trustee may pursue avoidance. See,e.g.,11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7544(a) (setting out\ncircumstances under which a trustee can avoid unrecorded liens and\nconveyances); \u00a7544(b) (detailing power to avoid based on rights\nthat unsecured creditors have under nonbankruptcy law); \u00a7545\n(setting out criteria that allow a trustee to avoid a statutory\nlien); \u00a7547 (detailing criteria for avoidance of so-called\n\u201cpreferential transfers\u201d). The particular avoidance provision at\nissue here is \u00a7548(a), which provides that a \u201ctrustee may avoid\u201d\ncertain fraudulent transfers \u201cof an interest of the debtor in\nproperty.\u201d \u00a7548(a)(1). Section 548(a)(1)(A) addresses so-called\n\u201cactually\u201d fraudulent transfers, which are \u201cmade .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwith actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which\nthe debtor was or became .\u00a0.\u00a0. indebted.\u201d Section\n548(a)(1)(B) addresses \u201cconstructively\u201d fraudulent transfers. SeeBFPv.Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.\u00a0S.\n531, 535 (1994) . As relevant to this case, the statute defines\nconstructive fraud in part as when a debtor:\u201c(B)(i) received less than a reasonably\nequivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation;\nand\u201c(ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such\ntransfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became\ninsolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation. 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7548(a)(1).If a transfer is avoided, \u00a7550 identifies the\nparties from whom the trustee may recover either the transferred\nproperty or the value of that property to return to the bankruptcy\nestate. Section 550(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201cto the\nextent that a transfer is avoided .\u00a0.\u00a0. the trustee may\nrecover .\u00a0.\u00a0. the property transferred, or, if the court\nso orders, the value of such property\u201d from \u201cthe initial transferee\nof such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was\nmade,\u201d or from \u201cany immediate or mediate transferee of such initial\ntransferee.\u201d \u00a7550(a).BThe Code sets out a number of limits on the\nexercise of these avoiding powers. See,e.g.,\u00a7546(a)\n(setting statute of limitations for avoidance actions);\n\u00a7\u00a7546(c)\u2013(d) (setting certain policy-based exceptions to avoiding\npowers); \u00a7548(a)(2) (setting limit to avoidance of \u201ca charitable\ncontribution to a qualified religious or charitable entity or\norganization\u201d). Central to this case is the securities safe harbor\nset forth in \u00a7546(e), which provides (as presently codified and in\nfull):\u201cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547,\n548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a\ntransfer that is a margin payment, as defined in section 101, 741,\nor 761 of this title, or settlement payment, as defined in section\n101 or 741 of this title, made by or to (or for the benefit\nof\u00a0) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant,\nstockbroker, financial institution, financial participant, or\nsecurities clearing agency, or that is a transfer made by or to (or\nfor the benefit of\u00a0) a commodity broker, forward contract\nmerchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial\nparticipant, or securities clearing agency, in connection with a\nsecurities contract, as defined in section 741(7), commodity\ncontract, as defined in section 761(4), or forward contract, that\nis made before the commencement of the case, except under section\n548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\u201dThe predecessor to this securities safe harbor,\nformerly codified at 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7764(c), was enacted in\n1978 against the backdrop of a district court decision in a case\ncalledSeligsonv.New York Produce Exchange, 394\nF.\u00a0Supp. 125 (SDNY 1975), which involved a transfer by a\nbankrupt commodity broker. See S. Rep. No. 95\u2013989, pp.\u00a08, 106\n(1978); see also Brubaker, Understanding the Scope of the \u00a7546(e)\nSecurities Safe Harbor Through the Concept of the \u201cTransfer\u201d Sought\nTo Be Avoided, 37 Bkrtcy. L. Letter 11\u201312 (July 2017). The\nbankruptcy trustee inSeligsonfiled suit seeking to avoid\nover $12 million in margin payments made by the commodity broker\ndebtor to a clearing association on the basis that the transfer was\nconstructively fraudulent. The clearing association attempted to\ndefend on the theory that it was a mere \u201cconduit\u201d for the\ntransmission of the margin payments. 394 F.\u00a0Supp., at 135. The\nDistrict Court found, however, triable issues of fact on that\nquestion and denied summary judgment, leaving the clearing\nassociation exposed to the risk of significant liability. Seeid.,at 135\u2013136. Following that decision, Congress enacted\nthe \u00a7764(c) safe harbor, providing that \u201cthe trustee may not avoid\na transfer that is a margin payment to or deposit with a commodity\nbroker or forward contract merchant or is a settlement payment made\nby a clearing organization.\u201d 92Stat. 2619, codified at 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7764(c) (repealed 1982).Congress amended the securities safe harbor\nexception over the years, each time expanding the categories of\ncovered transfers or entities. In 1982, Congress expanded the safe\nharbor to protect margin and settlement payments \u201cmade by or to a\ncommodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, or\nsecurities clearing agency.\u201d \u00a74, 96Stat. 236, codified at 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7546(d). Two years later Congress added\n\u201cfinancial institution\u201d to the list of protected entities. See\n\u00a7461(d), 98Stat. 377, codified at 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7546(e).[2] In 2005, Congress\nagain expanded the list of protected entities to include a\n\u201cfinancial participant\u201d (defined as an entity conducting certain\nhigh-value transactions). See \u00a7907(b), 119Stat. 181\u2013182; 11\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(22A). And, in 2006, Congress amended the\nprovision to cover transfers made in connection with securities\ncontracts, commodity contracts, and forward contracts. \u00a75(b)(1),\n120Stat. 2697\u20132698. The 2006 amendment also modified the statute to\nits current form by adding the new parenthetical phrase \u201c(or for\nthe benefit of\u00a0)\u201d after \u201cby or to,\u201d so that the safe harbor\nnow covers transfers made \u201cby or to (or for the benefit of\u00a0)\u201d\none of the covered entities.Id.,at 2697.CWith this background, we now turn to the facts\nof this case, which comes to this Court from the world of\ncompetitive harness racing (a form of horse racing). Harness racing\nis a closely regulated industry in Pennsylvania, and the\nCommonwealth requires a license to operate a racetrack. SeeBedford Downs Management Corp.v.State Harness Racing\nComm\u2019n, 592 Pa. 475, 485\u2013487, 926 A.\u00a02d 908, 914\u2013915\n(2007) (per curiam). The number of avail- able licenses is\nlimited, and in 2003 two companies, Valley View Downs, LP, and\nBedford Downs Management Corporation, were in competition for the\nlast harness-racing license in Pennsylvania.Valley View and Bedford Downs needed the\nharness-racing license to open a \u201c\u00a0\u2018racino,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which is a\nclever moniker for racetrack casino, \u201ca racing facility with slot\nmachines.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 8. Both companies were stopped\nbefore the finish line, because in 2005 the Pennsylvania State\nHarness Racing Commission denied both applications. The\nPennsylvania Supreme Court upheld those denials in 2007, but\nallowed the companies to reapply for the license. SeeBedford\nDowns, 592 Pa., at 478\u2013479, 926 A.\u00a02d, at 910.Instead of continuing to compete for the last\navailable harness-racing license, Valley View and Bedford Downs\nentered into an agreement to resolve their ongoing feud. Under that\nagreement, Bedford Downs withdrew as a competitor for the\nharness-racing license, and Valley View was to purchase all of\nBedford Downs\u2019 stock for $55 million after Valley View obtained the\nlicense.[3]With Bedford Downs out of the race, the\nPennsylvania Harness Racing Commission awarded Valley View the last\nharness-racing license. Valley View proceeded with the corporate\nacquisition required by the parties\u2019 agreement and arranged for the\nCayman Islands branch of Credit Suisse to finance the $55 million\npurchase price as part of a larger $850 million transaction. Credit\nSuisse wired the $55 million to Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania,\nwhich had agreed to serve as the third-party escrow agent for the\ntransaction. The Bedford Downs shareholders, including petitioner\nMerit Management Group, LP, deposited their stock certificates into\nescrow as well. At closing, Valley View received the Bedford Downs\nstock certificates, and in October 2007 Citizens Bank disbursed\n$47.5 million to the Bedford Downs shareholders, with $7.5 million\nremaining in escrow at Citizens Bank under the multiyear\nindemnification holdback period provided for in the parties\u2019\nagreement. Citizens Bank disbursed that $7.5 million installment to\nthe Bedford Downs shareholders in October 2010, after the holdback\nperiod ended. All told, Merit received approximately $16.5 million\nfrom the sale of its Bedford Downs stock to Valley View. Notably,\nthe closing statement for the transaction reflected Valley View as\nthe \u201cBuyer,\u201d the Bedford Downs shareholders as the \u201cSellers,\u201d and\n$55 million as the \u201cPurchase Price.\u201d App. 30.In the end, Valley View never got to open its\nracino. Although it had secured the last harness-racing license, it\nwas unable to secure a separate gaming license for the operation of\nthe slot machines in the time set out in its financing package.\nValley View and its parent company, Centaur, LLC, thereafter filed\nfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed a\nreorganization plan and appointed respondent FTI Consulting, Inc.,\nto serve as trustee of the Centaur litigation trust.FTI filed suit against Merit in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois, seeking to avoid the $16.5 million transfer\nfrom Valley View to Merit for the sale of Bedford Downs\u2019 stock. The\ncomplaint alleged that the transfer was constructively fraudulent\nunder \u00a7548(a)(1)(B) of the Code because Valley View was insolvent\nwhen it purchased Bedford Downs and \u201csignificantly overpaid\u201d for\nthe Bedford Downs stock.[4]\nMerit moved for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(c), contending that the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor\nbarred FTI from avoiding the Valley View-to-Merit transfer.\nAccording to Merit, the safe harbor applied because the transfer\nwas a \u201csettlement payment .\u00a0.\u00a0. made by or to (or for the\nbenefit of\u00a0)\u201d a covered \u201cfinancial institution\u201d\u2014here, Credit\nSuisse and Citizens Bank.The District Court granted the Rule 12(c)\nmotion, reasoning that the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor applied because the\nfinancial institutions transferred or received funds in connection\nwith a \u201csettlement payment\u201d or \u201csecurities contract.\u201d See 541\nB.\u00a0R. 850, 858 (ND Ill. 2015).[5] The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed,\nholding that the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor did not protect transfers in\nwhich financial institutions served as mere conduits. See 830\nF.\u00a03d 690, 691 (2016). This Court granted certiorari to\nresolve a conflict among the circuit courts as to the proper\napplication of the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor.[6] 581 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).IIThe question before this Court is whether the\ntransfer between Valley View and Merit implicates the safe harbor\nexception because the transfer was \u201cmade by or to (or for the\nbenefit of\u00a0) a .\u00a0.\u00a0. financial institution.\u201d\n\u00a7546(e). The parties and the lower courts dedicate much of their\nattention to the definition of the words \u201cby or to (or for the\nbenefit of\u00a0)\u201d as used in \u00a7546(e), and to the question whether\nthere is a requirement that the \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or other\ncovered entity have a beneficial interest in or dominion and\ncontrol over the transferred property in order to qualify for safe\nharbor protection. In our view, those inquiries put the proverbial\ncart before the horse. Before a court can determine whether a\ntransfer was made by or to or for the benefit of a covered entity,\nthe court must first identify the relevant transfer to test in that\ninquiry. At bottom, that is the issue the parties dispute in this\ncase.On one side, Merit posits that the Court should\nlook not only to the Valley View-to-Merit end-to-end transfer, but\nalso to all its component parts. Here, those component parts\ninclude one transaction by Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank\n(i.e.,the transmission of the $16.5 million from Credit\nSuisse to escrow at Citizens Bank), and two transactions by\nCitizens Bank to Merit (i.e.,the transmission of $16.5\nmillion over two installments by Citizens Bank as escrow agent to\nMerit). Because those component parts include transactions by and\nto financial institutions, Merit contends that \u00a7546(e) bars\navoidance.FTI, by contrast, maintains that the only\nrelevant transfer for purposes of the \u00a7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry\nis the overarching transfer between Valley View and Merit of $16.5\nmillion for purchase of the stock, which is the transfer that the\ntrustee seeks to avoid under \u00a7548(a)(1)(B). Because that transfer\nwas not made by, to, or for the benefit of a financial institution,\nFTI contends that the safe harbor has no application.The Court agrees with FTI. The language of\n\u00a7546(e), the specific context in which that language is used, and\nthe broader statutory structure all support the conclusion that the\nrelevant transfer for purposes of the \u00a7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry\nis the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under\none of the substantive avoidance provisions.AOur analysis begins with the text of \u00a7546(e),\nand we look to both \u201cthe language itself [and] the specific context\nin which that language is used .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dRobinsonv.Shell Oil Co., 519 U.\u00a0S. 337, 341\n(1997) . The pertinent language provides:\u201cNotwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547,\n548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a\ntransfer that is a .\u00a0.\u00a0. settlement payment\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. made by or to (or for the benefit of\u00a0) a\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial institution .\u00a0.\u00a0. or that is a\ntransfer made by or to (or for the benefit of\u00a0) a\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. financial institution .\u00a0.\u00a0. in connection\nwith a securities contract .\u00a0.\u00a0. , except under section\n548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\u201dThe very first clause\u2014\u201cNotwithstanding sections\n544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title\u201d\u2014already\nbegins to answer the question. It indicates that \u00a7546(e) operates\nas an exception to the avoiding powers afforded to the trustee\nunder the substantive avoidance provisions. See A. Scalia & B.\nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 126 (2012)\n(\u201cA dependent phrase that begins withnotwithstandingindicates that the main clause that it introduces or follows\nderogates from the provision to which it refers\u201d). That is, when\nfaced with a transfer that is otherwise avoidable, \u00a7546(e) provides\na safe harbor notwithstanding that avoiding power. From the outset,\ntherefore, the text makes clear that the starting point for the\n\u00a7546(e) inquiry is the substantive avoiding power under the\nprovisions expressly listed in the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause and,\nconsequently, the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid as an\nexercise of those powers.Then again in the very last clause\u2014\u201cexcept under\nsection 548(a)(1)(A) of this title\u201d\u2014the text reminds us that the\nfocus of the inquiry is the transfer that the trustee seeks to\navoid. It does so by creating an exception to the exception,\nproviding that \u201cthe trustee may not avoid a transfer\u201d that meets\nthe covered transaction and entity criteria of the safe harbor,\n\u201cexcept\u201d for an actually fraudulent transfer under \u00a7548(a)(1)(A).\n11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7546(e). By referring back to a specific type\nof transfer that falls within the avoiding power, Congress signaled\nthat the excep- tion applies to the overarching transfer that the\ntrustee seeks to avoid, not any component part of that\ntransfer.Reinforcing that reading of the safe-harbor\nprovision, the section heading for \u00a7546\u2014within which the securities\nsafe harbor is found\u2014is: \u201cLimitations on avoiding powers.\u201d Although\nsection headings cannot limit the plain meaning of a statutory\ntext, seeFlorida Dept. of Revenuev.Piccadilly\nCafeterias, Inc., 554 U.\u00a0S. 33, 47 (2008) , \u201cthey supply\ncues\u201d as to what Congress intended, seeYatesv.United\nStates, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10). In\nthis case, the relevant section heading demonstrates the close\nconnection between the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid and\nthe transfer that is exempted from that avoiding power pursuant to\nthe safe harbor.The rest of the statutory text confirms what the\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d and \u201cexcept\u201d clauses and the section heading\nbegin to suggest. The safe harbor provides that \u201cthe trustee may\nnot avoid\u201d certain transfers. \u00a7546(e). Naturally, that text invites\nscrutiny of the transfers that \u201cthe trustee may avoid,\u201d the\nparallel language used in the substantive avoiding powers\nprovisions. See \u00a7544(a) (providing that \u201cthe trustee\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. may avoid\u201d transfers falling under that provision);\n\u00a7545 (providing that \u201c[t]he trustee may avoid\u201d certain statutory\nliens); \u00a7547(b) (providing that \u201cthe trustee may avoid\u201d certain\npreferential transfers); \u00a7548(a)(1) (providing that \u201c[t]he trustee\nmay avoid\u201d certain fraudulent transfers). And if any doubt\nremained, the language that follows dispels that doubt: The\ntransfer that the \u201cthe trustee may not avoid\u201d is specified to be \u201ca\ntransfer thatis\u201d either a \u201csettlement payment\u201d or made \u201cin\nconnection with a securities contract.\u201d \u00a7546(e) (emphasis added).\nNot a transfer that involves. Not a transfer that comprises. But a\ntransfer that is a securities transaction covered under \u00a7546(e).\nThe provision explicitly equates the transfer that the trustee may\notherwise avoid with the transfer that, under the safe harbor, the\ntrustee may not avoid. In other words, to qualify for protection\nunder the securities safe harbor, \u00a7546(e) provides that the\notherwise avoidable transfer itself be a transfer that meets the\nsafe-harbor criteria.Thus, the statutory language and the context in\nwhich it is used all point to the transfer that the trustee seeks\nto avoid as the relevant transfer for consideration of the \u00a7546(e)\nsafe-harbor criteria.BThe statutory structure also reinforces our\nreading of \u00a7546(e). SeeHallv.United States, 566\nU.\u00a0S. 506, 516 (2012) (looking to statutory structure in\ninterpreting the Bankruptcy Code). As the Seventh Circuit aptly put\nit, the Code \u201ccreates both a system for avoiding transfers and a\nsafe harbor from avoidance\u2014logically these are two sides of the\nsame coin.\u201d 830 F.\u00a03d, at 694; see alsoFidelity Financial\nServices, Inc.v.Fink, 522 U.\u00a0S. 211, 217 (1998)\n(\u201cSection 546 of the Code puts certain limits on the avoidance\npowers set forth elsewhere\u201d). Given that structure, it is only\nlogical to view the pertinent transfer under \u00a7546(e) as the same\ntransfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to one of its\navoiding powers.As noted in Part I\u2013A,supra, the\nsubstantive avoidance provisions in Chapter 5 of the Code set out\nin detail the criteria that must be met for a transfer to fall\nwithin the ambit of the avoiding powers. These provisions, as Merit\nadmits, \u201cfocus mostly on the characteristics of the transfer that\nmay be avoided.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. The trustee, charged with\nexercising those avoiding powers, must establish to the\nsatisfaction of a court that the transfer it seeks to set aside\nmeets the characteristics set out under the substantive avoidance\nprovisions. Thus, the trustee is not free to define the transfer\nthat it seeks to avoid in any way it chooses. Instead, that\ntransfer is necessarily defined by the carefully set out criteria\nin the Code. As FTI itself recognizes, its power as trustee to\ndefine the transfer is not absolute because \u201cthe transfer\nidentified must sat- isfy the terms of the avoidance provision the\ntrustee invokes.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23.Accordingly, after a trustee files an avoidance\naction identifying the transfer it seeks to set aside, a defendant\nin that action is free to argue that the trustee failed to properly\nidentify an avoidable transfer under the Code, including any\navailable arguments concerning the role of component parts of the\ntransfer. If a trustee properly identifies an avoidable transfer,\nhowever, the court has no reason to examine the relevance of\ncomponent parts when considering a limit to the avoiding power,\nwhere that limit is defined by reference to an otherwise avoidable\ntransfer, as is the case with \u00a7546(e), see Part II\u2013A,supra.In the instant case, FTI identified the purchase\nof Bedford Downs\u2019 stock by Valley View from Merit as the transfer\nthat it sought to avoid. Merit does not contend that FTI improperly\nidentified the Valley View-to-Merit transfer as the transfer to be\navoided, focusing instead on whether FTI can \u201cignore\u201d the component\nparts at the safe-harbor inquiry. Absent that argument, however,\nthe Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank component parts are simply\nirrelevant to the analysis under \u00a7546(e). The focus must remain on\nthe transfer the trustee sought to avoid.IIIAThe primary argument Merit advances that is\nmoored in the statutory text concerns the 2006 addition of the\nparenthetical \u201c(or for the benefit of\u00a0)\u201d to \u00a7546(e). Merit\ncontends that in adding the phrase \u201cor for the benefit of\u201d to the\nrequirement that a transfer be \u201cmade by or to\u201d a protected entity,\nCongress meant to abrogate the 1998 decision of the Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit inIn re Munford, Inc., 98\nF.3d 604, 610 (1996) (per curiam), which held that the\n\u00a7546(e) safe harbor was inapplicable to transfers in which a\nfinancial institution acted only as an intermediary. Congress\nabrogatedMunford, Merit reasons, by use of the disjunctive\n\u201cor,\u201d so that even if a beneficial interest,i.e.,a\ntransfer \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d a financial institution or other\ncovered entity, is sufficient to trigger safe harbor protection, it\nis not necessary for the financial institution to have a beneficial\ninterest in the transfer for the safe harbor to apply. Merit thus\nargues that a transaction \u201cby or to\u201d a financial institution such\nas Credit Suisse or Citizens Bank would meet the requirements of\n\u00a7546(e), even if the financial institution is acting as an\nintermediary without a beneficial interest in the transfer.Merit points to nothing in the text or\nlegislative history that corroborates the proposition that Congress\nsought to overruleMunfordin its 2006 amendment. There is a\nsimpler explanation for Congress\u2019 addition of this language that is\nrooted in the text of the statute as a whole and consistent with\nthe interpretation of \u00a7546(e) the Court adopts. A number of the\nsubstantive avoidance provisions include that language, thus giving\na trustee the power to avoid a transfer that was made to \u201cor for\nthe benefit of\u201d certain actors. See \u00a7547(b)(1) (avoiding power with\nrespect to preferential transfers \u201cto or for the benefit of a\ncreditor\u201d); \u00a7548(a)(1) (avoiding power with respect to certain\nfraudulent transfers \u201cincluding any transfer to or for the benefit\nof an insider .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\u201d). By adding the same language\nto the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor, Congress ensured that the scope of the\nsafe harbor matched the scope of the avoiding powers. For example,\na trustee seeking to avoid a preferential transfer under \u00a7547 that\nwas made \u201cfor the benefit of a creditor,\u201d where that creditor is a\ncovered entity under \u00a7546(e), cannot now escape application of the\n\u00a7546(e) safe harbor just because the transfer was not \u201cmade by or\nto\u201d that entity.Nothing in the amendment therefore changed the\nfocus of the \u00a7546(e) safe-harbor inquiry on the transfer that is\notherwise avoidable under the substantive avoiding powers. If\nanything, by tracking language already included in the substantive\navoidance provisions, the amendment reinforces the connection\nbetween the inquiry under \u00a7546(e) and the otherwise avoidable\ntransfer that the trustee seeks to set aside.Merit next attempts to bolster its reading of\nthe safe harbor by reference to the inclusion of securities\nclearing agencies as covered entities under \u00a7546(e). Because a\nsecurities clearing agency is defined as,inter alia, an\nintermediary in payments or deliveries made in connection with\nsecurities transactions, see 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778c(23)(A) and\n11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(48) (defining \u201csecurities clearing\nagency\u201d by reference to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), Merit\nargues that the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor must be read to protect\nintermediaries without reference to any beneficial interest in the\ntransfer. The contrary interpretation, Merit contends, \u201cwould run\nafoul of the canon disfavoring an interpretation of a statute that\nrenders a provision ineffectual or superfluous.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 25.Putting aside the question whether a securities\nclearing agency always acts as an intermediary without a beneficial\ninterest in a challenged transfer\u2014a question that the District\nCourt inSeligsonfound presented triable issues of fact in\nthat case\u2014the reading of the statute the Court adopts here does not\nyield any superfluity. Reading \u00a7546(e) to provide that the relevant\ntransfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the\ntrustee seeks to avoid under a substantive avoiding power, the\nquestion then becomes whether that transfer was \u201cmade by or to (or\nfor the benefit of\u00a0)\u201d a covered entity, including a securities\nclearing agency. If the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid\nwas made \u201cby\u201d or \u201cto\u201d a securities clearing agency (as it was inSeligson), then \u00a7546(e) will bar avoidance, and it will do\nso without regard to whether the entity acted only as an\nintermediary. The safe harbor will, in addition, bar avoidance if\nthe transfer was made \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d that securities clearing\nagency, even if it was not made \u201cby\u201d or \u201cto\u201d that entity. This\nreading gives full effect to the text of \u00a7546(e).BIn a final attempt to support its proposed\ninterpretation of \u00a7546(e), Merit turns to what it perceives was\nCongress\u2019 purpose in enacting the safe harbor. Specifically, Merit\ncontends that the broad language of \u00a7546(e) shows that Congress\ntook a \u201ccomprehensive approach to securities and commodities\ntransactions\u201d that \u201cwas prophylactic, not surgical,\u201d and meant to\n\u201cadvanc[e] the interests of parties in the finality of\ntransactions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 41\u201343. Given that purported\nbroad purpose, it would be incongruous, according to Merit, to read\nthe safe harbor such that its application \u201cwould depend on the\nidentity of the investor and the manner in which it held its\ninvestment\u201d rather than \u201cthe nature of the transaction generally.\u201dId.,at 33. Moreover, Merit posits that Congress\u2019 concern\nwas plainly broader than the risk that is posed by the imposition\nof avoidance liability on a securities industry entity because\nCongress provided a safe harbor not only for transactions \u201cto\u201d\nthose entities (thus protecting the entities from direct financial\nliability), but also \u201cby\u201d these entities to non-covered entities.\nSee Reply Brief 10\u201314. And, according to Merit, \u201c[t]here is no\nreason to believe that Congress was troubled by the possibility\nthat transfersbyan industry hub could be unwound but yet\nwas unconcerned about trustees\u2019 pursuit of transfers madethroughindustry hubs.\u201dId.,at 12\u201313 (emphasis in\noriginal).Even if this were the type of case in which the\nCourt would consider statutory purpose, see,e.g., Watsonv.Philip Morris Cos., 551 U.\u00a0S. 142 \u2013152 (2007), here\nMerit fails to support its purposivist arguments. In fact, its\nperceived purpose is actually contradicted by the plain language of\nthe safe harbor. Because, of course, here we do have a good reason\nto believe that Congress was concerned about transfers \u201cbyan industry hub\u201d specifically: The safe harbor saves from avoidance\ncertain securities transactions \u201cmade by or to (or for the benefit\nof\u00a0)\u201d covered entities. See \u00a7546(e). Transfers \u201cthrough\u201d a\ncovered entity, conversely, appear nowhere in the statute. And\nalthough Merit complains that, absent its reading of the safe\nharbor, protection will turn \u201con the identity of the investor and\nthe manner in which it held its investment,\u201d that is nothing more\nthan an attack on the text of the statute, which protects only\ncertain transactions \u201cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\u00a0)\u201d\ncertain covered entities.For these reasons, we need not deviate from the\nplain meaning of the language used in \u00a7546(e).IVFor the reasons stated, we conclude that the\nrelevant transfer for purposes of the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor is the\nsame transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to its\nsubstantive avoiding powers. Applying that understanding of the\nsafe-harbor provision to this case yields a straightforward result.\nFTI, the trustee, sought to avoid the $16.5 million Valley\nView-to-Merit transfer. FTI did not seek to avoid the component\ntransactions by which that overarching transfer was executed. As\nsuch, when determining whether the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor saves the\ntransfer from avoidance liability,i.e.,whether it was\n\u201cmade by or to (or for the benefit of\u00a0) a .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfinancial institution,\u201d the Court must look to the overarching\ntransfer from Valley View to Merit to evaluate whether it meets the\nsafe-harbor criteria. Because the parties do not contend that\neither Valley View or Merit is a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or other\ncovered entity, the transfer falls outside of the \u00a7546(e) safe\nharbor. The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is therefore affirmed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1Avoiding powers may be\nexercised by debtors, trustees, or creditors\u2019 committees, depending\non the circumstances of the case. See generally C. Tabb, Law of\nBankruptcy \u00a76.1 (4th ed. 2016) (Tabb). Because this case concerns\nan avoidance action brought by a trustee, we refer throughout to\nthe trustee in discussing the avoiding power and avoidance action.\nThe resolution of this case is not dependent on the identity of the\nactor exercising the avoiding power.2The term \u201cfinancial\ninstitution\u201d is defined as: \u201c(A) a Federal reserve bank, or an\nentity that is a commercial or savings bank, industrial savings\nbank, savings and loan association, trust company,\nfederally-insured credit union, or receiver, liquidating agent, or\nconservator for such entity and, when any such Federal reserve\nbank, receiver, liquidating agent, conservator or entity is acting\nas agent or custodian for a customer (whether or not a \u2018customer\u2019,\nas defined in section 741) in connection with a securities contract\n(as defined in section 741) such customer; or \u201c(B) in connection\nwith a securities contract (as defined in section 741) an\ninvestment company registered under the Investment Company Act of\n1940.\u201d 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(22). The parties here do not\ncontend that either the debtor or petitioner in this case qualified\nas a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d by virtue of its status as a\n\u201ccustomer\u201d under \u00a7101(22)(A). Petitioner Merit Management Group,\nLP, discussed this definition only in footnotes and did not argue\nthat it somehow dictates the outcome in this case. See Brief for\nPetitioner 45, n.\u00a014; Reply Brief 14, n.\u00a06. We therefore\ndo not address what impact, if any, \u00a7101(22)(A) would have in the\napplication of the \u00a7546(e) safe harbor.3A separate provision of\nthe agreement providing that Bedford Downs would sell land to\nValley View for $20 million is not at issue in this\ncase.4In its complaint, FTI\nalso sought to avoid the transfer under \u00a7544(b). See App. 20\u201321.\nThe District Court did not address the claim, see 541 B.\u00a0R.\n850, 852\u2013853, n.\u00a01 (ND Ill. 2015), and neither did the Court\nof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.5The parties do not ask\nthis Court to determine whether the transaction at issue in this\ncase qualifies as a transfer that is a \u201csettlement payment\u201d or made\nin connection with a \u201csecurities contract\u201d as those terms are used\nin \u00a7546(e), nor is that determination necessary for resolution of\nthe question presented.6CompareIn re Quebecor\nWorld (USA) Inc., 719 F.\u00a03d 94, 99 (CA2 2013) (finding the\nsafe harbor applicable where covered entity was intermediary);In re QSI Holdings, Inc., 571 F.\u00a03d 545, 551 (CA6 2009)\n(same);Contemporary Indus.
