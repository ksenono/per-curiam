ORTIZ, PETITIONERv.UNITED\nSTATESon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the armed forces[June 22, 2018]Justice Thomas, concurring.I join the Court\u2019s opinion in full, which\npersuasively explains why petitioner\u2019s statutory and constitutional\narguments lack merit. I also agree that the statute giving this\nCourt appellate jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Court\nof Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71259, complies with Article III of the Constitution. I write\nseparately to explain why that conclusion is consistent with the\nFounders\u2019 understanding of judicial power\u2014specifically, the\ndistinction they drew between public and private rights.[1]IArticle III vests \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States\u201d in this Court and any inferior courts that Congress\nchooses to establish. \u00a71. The judicial power includes the power to\nresolve the specific types of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies\u201d listed in\n\u00a72. Article III divides this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over those cases\ninto two categories: \u201coriginal Jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cappellate\nJurisdiction.\u201d This Court has original jurisdiction in cases\naffecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and\ncases in which a State is a party. This Court has appellate\njurisdiction \u201c[i]n all the other Cases before mentioned\u201d in \u00a72.\nBecause all agree that the CAAF decides \u201cother Cases\u201d that are not\nreserved for this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, we can review its\ndecisions only under our appellate jurisdiction.The text of Article III imposes two important\nlimits on this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. First, as mentioned,\nthis Court can review only the \u201cother Cases\u201d that are \u201cbefore\nmentioned\u201d\u2014i.e.,the subject matters of cases listed in \u00a72\nthat are not reserved for its original jurisdiction. Second, this\nCourt\u2019s \u201cappellate Jurisdiction\u201d cannot be \u201coriginal.\u201d As Chief\nJustice Marshall explained, \u201cthe essential criterion of appellate\njurisdiction\u201d is that \u201cit revises and corrects the proceedings in a\ncause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\u201dMarburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 175 (1803). Thus,\nthis Court cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction unless it is\nreviewing an already completed exercise of \u201cjudicial power.\u201dIn\nre Sanborn, 148 U.\u00a0S. 222, 224 (1893); see alsoThe\nAlicia, 7 Wall. 571, 573 (1869) (\u201cAn appellate jurisdiction\nnecessarily implies some judicial determination, some judgment,\ndecree, or order of an inferior tribunal, from which an appeal has\nbeen taken\u201d); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States \u00a71755, p.\u00a0627 (1833) (explaining that this Court\ncan review only decisions \u201cby one clothed with judicial authority,\nand acting in a judicial capacity\u201d).Other than these two limits, the text of Article\nIII imposes no other self-executing constraints on this Court\u2019s\nappellate jurisdiction. Most notably, it does not require appeals\nto come from any specific type of tribunal, such as an Article III\ncourt. As Justice Story explained, \u201cThe appellate power is not\nlimited by the terms of the third article to any particular\ncourts.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It is thecase, then, and notthecourt, that gives the jurisdiction. If the\njudicial power extends to the case, it will be in vain to search in\nthe letter of the constitution for any qualification as to the\ntribunal.\u201dMartinv.Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304,\n338 (1816). Hamilton made the same point years earlier: \u201cThe\nConstitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the\nSupreme Court in all the enumerated cases .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0,\nwithout a single expression to confine its operation to the\ninferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals\nfrom which it is to be made, are alone contemplated.\u201d The\nFederalist No.\u00a082, pp.\u00a0493\u2013494 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961);\nsee alsoid.,No.\u00a081, at\u00a0489 (A. Hamilton)\n(rejecting a \u201ctechnical interpretation\u201d of the word \u201cappellate\u201d and\ndefining it to mean \u201cnothing more than the power of one tribunal to\nreview the proceedings of another\u201d). This Court has relied on the\nlack of tribunal-specific limits in Article III to exercise\nappellate jurisdiction over several types of non-Article III\ncourts, including state courts, seeMartin,supra, at\n338, and territorial courts, seeUnited Statesv.Coe, 155 U.\u00a0S. 76, 85\u201386 (1894);Wellness Int\u2019l\nNetwork, Ltd.v.Sharif, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___\u2013___,\nn.\u00a02 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7\u20138,\nn.\u00a02) (discussingAmerican Ins. Co.v.356 Bales of\nCotton, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828)). In short, this Court\u2019s\nappellate jurisdiction requires the exercise ofajudicial\npower, not necessarily \u201c[t]hejudicial Power of the\nUnited States\u201d that Article III vests exclusively in the federal\ncourts, \u00a71 (emphasis added).The Founders\u2019 understanding of judicial power\nwas heavily influenced by the well-known distinction between public\nand private rights.

The three classic private rights\u2014life, liberty,\nand property\u2014are \u201c\u00a0\u2018unalienable\u2019\u00a0\u201d and\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018absolute,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as they are \u201cnot dependent upon the will\nof the government.\u201dIbid.The Founders linked the\ndisposition of private rights with the exercise of judicial power.\nSeeid.,at ___ (slip op., at 10). They considered \u201cthe\npower to act conclusively against [private] rights [as] the core of\nthe judicial power.\u201dIbid.A disposition of private rights did not amount\nto an exercise of judicial power, however, unless it also satisfied\n\u201csome basic procedural requirements.\u201d Nelson 574. Stated\ndifferently, the disposition had to \u201cassume such a form that the\njudicial power is capable of acting on it.\u201dOsbornv.Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 819 (1824). \u201c[T]hat\nform generally required the presence (actual or constructive) of\nadverse parties who had been given some opportunity to be heard\nbefore the court rendered a final judgment that bound them.\u201d Nelson\n574. Once a dispute took this form, judicial power is exercised by\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018determin[ing] all differences according to the established\nlaw.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWellness,supra, at ___ (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (slip op., at 6) (quoting J. Locke, Second Treatise of\nCivil Government \u00a7125, p.\u00a063 (J. Gough ed. 1947)).IIASo understood, the CAAF exercises a judicial\npower. As I explained inWellness, military courts\nadjudicate core private rights to life, liberty, and property. See\n575 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 6\u20137).\nThat these courts adjudicate core private rights does not\ncontradict the Vesting Clause of Article III, which permits only\nfederal courts to exercise \u201cthe judicial Power of the United\nStates.\u201d Like other provisions of the Constitution, this language\nmust be read against \u201ccommonly accepted background understandings\nand interpretative principles in place when the Constitution was\nwritten,\u201d including the principle that general constitutional rules\ncould apply \u201cdifferently to civil than to military entities.\u201d\nMascott, Who Are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d? 70 Stan. L. Rev.\n443, 480\u2013483 (2018) (citing Nelson 576); see alsoNorthern\nPipeline Constr. Co.v.Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458\nU.\u00a0S. 50, 64 (1982) (plurality opinion) (explaining that\ninter- preting Article III to exclude military courts \u201csimply\nacknowledge[s] that the literal command of Art. III .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nmust be interpreted in light of .\u00a0.\u00a0. historical context\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and of the structural imperatives of the\nConstitution as a whole\u201d). Based on the \u201cconstellation of\nconstitutional provisions that [indicate] Congress has the power to\nprovide for the adjudication of disputes among the Armed Forces it\ncreates,\u201d our precedents have long construed the Vesting Clause of\nArticle III to extend \u201conly tocivilianjudicial power.\u201dWellness, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)\n(slip op., at 8) (citingDynesv.Hoover, 20 How. 65,\n78\u201379 (1858)). In other words, the powers that the Constitution\ngives Congress over the military are \u201cso exceptional\u201d that they are\nthought to include the power to create courts that can exercise a\njudicial power outside the confines of Article III.Northern\nPipeline,supra,at 64. Thus, military courts are better\nthought of as an \u201cexception\u201d or \u201ccarve-out\u201d from the Vesting Clause\nof Article III, rather than an entity that does not implicate the\nVesting Clause because it does not exercise judicial power in the\nfirst place. SeeWellness,supra, at ___\u2013___ (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 6\u20138).No party in this case challenges the legitimacy\nof the historical exception for military courts. And for good\nreason: \u201cAt the time of the Framing, .\u00a0.\u00a0. it was already\ncommon for nations to organize military tribunals that stood apart\nfrom the ordinary civilian courts, and the United States itself had\ndone so.\u201d Nelson 576. As the Court explains, military courts\npredate the Constitution, were well-known to the Founders, were\nauthorized by the First Congress, and are expressly contemplated by\nthe Fifth Amendment.Ante,at 9. The crucial point for\npresent purposes, however, is that military courts are considered\nexempt from the structural requirements of Article III \u201cbecause of\nother provisions of the Constitution, not because of the definition\nof judicial power.\u201dWellness, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 8) (citing Nelson 576). They\nplainly fall within that definition.Military courts \u201chave long been understood to\nexercise \u2018judicial\u2019 power\u201d because they \u201cact upon core private\nrights to person and property.\u201dId.,at 576. \u201c[C]lothed with\njudicial powers,\u201d these courts decide \u201cquestions of the most\nmomentous description, affecting .\u00a0.\u00a0. even life itself.\u201d\nW. De Hart, Observations on Military Law 14 (1859); see also 11 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 19, 21 (1864) (explaining that military courts are\n\u201cjudicial\u201d because they \u201cpass upon the most sacred questions of\nhuman rights .\u00a0.\u00a0. which, in the very nature of things,\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. must be adjudgedaccording to law\u201d). Here,\nfor example, the CAAF adjudicated the legality of petitioner\u2019s\nchild-pornography convictions and his sentence of two years\nconfinement\u2014a classic deprivation of liberty, seeObergefellv.Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 4\u20136). \u201cThe passing of judgment on the\nlife and liberty of those convicted by the government in a military\ntrial surely falls within the judicial power.\u201d Willis, The\nConstitution, the United States Court of Military Appeals and the\nFuture, 57 Mil. L. Rev. 27, 84 (1972). This Court has acknowledged\nthat military courts adjudicate core private rights, as it has\nrepeatedly held that the prosecution ofnonservicemembers in\nthese courts would violate Article III. SeeNorthern\nPipeline,supra, at 66, n.\u00a017 (plurality opinion);e.g., United States ex rel. Tothv.Quarles, 350\nU.\u00a0S. 11 (1955) (former servicemembers);Reidv.Covert, 354 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1957) (spouses of\nservicemembers).[2]In addition to adjudicating private rights, the\nCAAF\u2019s cases \u201cassume such a form that the judicial power is capable\nof acting on [them].\u201dOsborn, 9 Wheat., at 819. The CAAF\nadjudicates cases involving \u201cadverse parties who ha[ve] been given\nsome opportunity to be heard.\u201d Nelson 574. It has independent\nauthority to \u201cprescribe\u201d its own \u201crules of procedure,\u201d 10\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7944, which provide for briefing, oral argument,\nand other procedures that mirror a federal court of appeals. See\ngenerally CAAF Rules of Practice and Proc. (2017). The CAAF also\ndecides cases \u201c\u00a0\u2018according to the established law.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWellness, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)\n(slip op., at 6). It can act \u201conly with respect to matters of law,\u201d\n\u00a7867(c), and its civilian judges decide cases by independently\ninterpreting the Constitution, the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice, and other federal laws. Lastly, the CAAF renders \u201cfinal\njudgment[s] that b[ind] [the parties].\u201d Nelson 574. Its judgments\nare \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d as soon as they are published and are\n\u201cbinding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of\nthe United States.\u201d \u00a7876. The Executive Branch has no statutory\nauthority to review or modify the CAAF\u2019s decisions.[3] In short, when it comes to the CAAF,\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he whole proceeding from its inception is\njudicial.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRunklev.United States, 122\nU.\u00a0S. 543, 558 (1887) (quoting 11 Op. Atty. Gen., at\n21).[4]BProfessor Bamzai contends that the CAAF\nexercises an executive, not a judicial, power. He notes that this\nCourt has described the CAAF as an \u201cExecutive Branch entity,\u201dEdmondv.United States, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651, 664\n(1997), and he cites commentators who describe military courts as\n\u201cinstrumentalities of the executive power\u201d because they help the\nPresident maintain discipline over the Armed Forces, W. Winthrop,\nMilitary Law and Precedents 49 (2d ed. 1920); G. Davis, Military\nLaw of the United States 15 (2d ed. 1909). Professor Bamzai also\ncompares the CAAF to administrative agencies, which he contends\nexercise executive power. If agencies exercised core judicial\npower, he notes, they would be acting unconstitutionally because\nthey do not enjoy the structural protections of Article III. SeeArlingtonv.FCC, 569 U.\u00a0S. 290, 304, n.\u00a04\n(2013).These arguments miss the mark. While the CAAF is\nin the Executive Branch and its purpose is to help the President\nmaintain troop discipline, those facts do not change thenatureof the power that it exercises. See Brigadier General\nS.\u00a0T. Ansell\u2019s Brief Filed in Support of His Office Opinion\n(Dec. 11, 1917), reprinted in Hearings on S.\u00a064 before the\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, 66th\nCong., 1st Sess., 71, 76 (1919). And it is the nature of the power,\nnot the branch exercising it, that controls our appellate\njurisdiction:\u201cThe controlling question is whether the\nfunction to be exercised .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a judicial function\n.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. We must not \u2018be misled by a name, but look\nto the substance and intent of the proceeding.\u2019United\nStatesv.Ritchie, 17 How. 525, 534 [(1855)]. \u2018It is not\nimportant .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether such a proceeding was originally\nbegun by an administrative or executive determination, if when it\ncomes to the court, whether legislative or constitutional, it calls\nfor the exercise of only the judicial power.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFederal\nRadio Comm\u2019nv.Nelson Brothers Bond & Mortgage Co.\n(Station WIBO), 289 U.\u00a0S. 266, 277\u2013278 (1933) (some\ncitations omitted).As explained, the CAAF exercises a judicial\npower because it adjudicates private rights. That the Constitution\npermits this Executive Branch entity to exercise a particular\njudicial power\u2014due to the political branches\u2019 expansive\nconstitutional powers over the military\u2014does not change the\nanalysis.Professor Bamzai\u2019s analogy to administrative\nagencies is flawed. Professor Bamzai assumes that, when\nadministrative agencies adjudicate private rights, they are not\nexercising judicial power. But they are. SeeB&B Hardware,\nInc.v.Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11\u201312). In\nfact, they are unconstitutionally exercising \u201c[t]he judicial Power\nof the United States,\u201d as agencies are not Article III courts and\ndo not \u201cenjoy a unique, textually based\u201d carve-out from the Vesting\nClause of Article III.Wellness, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___\n(opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 14). The CAAF does enjoy such\na carveout, as I explained inWellness. But both it and\nadministrative agencies exercise a judicial power when they\nadjudicate private rights. Contrary to the premise underlying\nProfessor Bamzai\u2019s argument, questions implicating the separation\nof powers cannot be answered by arguing, in circular fashion, that\nwhatever the Executive Branch does is necessarily an exercise of\nexecutive power.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Because the CAAF exercises a judicial power,\nthe statute giving this Court appellate jurisdiction over its\ndecisions does not violate Article III. For these reasons, and the\nreasons given by the Court, I concur.Notes1I express no view on any\nother arguments that were not raised by the parties oramicusin this case, including any arguments based on\nArticle II of the Constitution.2Servicemembers consent to\nmilitary jurisdiction when they enlist. While this consent might\nallow military courts to adjudicate a servicemember\u2019s private\nrights, it does not transform the nature of the power that the\nmilitary courts exercise, or somehow transform the servicemember\u2019s\nprivate right to life, liberty, or property into a public right.\nSeeWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd.v.Sharif, 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 6, 14).3Unlike the CAAF\u2019s\ndecisions, court-martial proceedings are not final until they are\napproved by the convening authority. See 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7876. But the CAAF does not review court-martial proceedings untilafterthey have been approved and have been reviewed by an\nintermediate Court of Criminal Appeals. See \u00a7867(c). Because \u201cthe\n[CAAF] reviews court-martial convictions after executive branch\nreview ends,\u201d the \u201c[r]eview of its decisions in the Supreme Court\nof the United States, by certiorari, .\u00a0.\u00a0. poses no\nfinality problems\u201d under Article III. Pfander, Article I Tribunals,\nArticle III Courts, and the Judicial Power of the United States,\n118 Harv. L. Rev. 643, 717, n.\u00a0327 (2004).4Most of the statutes\ncited above are unique to the CAAF\u2014the court whose decision we are\nreviewing and, thus, the only one that matters for purposes of our\nappellate jurisdiction. I express no view on whether this Court\ncould directly review the CAAF, absent these statutes. And I\nexpress no view on whether this Court could directly review the\ndecisions of other military courts, such as courts-martial or\nmilitary commissions. Cf.id.,at 723, n.\u00a0358\n(suggesting that this Court could not directly review\ncourts-martial and military commissions because their proceedings\nare \u201csummary\u201d and \u201ccreate no record to support writ of error\nreview\u201d); Choper & Yoo, Wartime Process: A Dialogue on\nCongressional Power to Remove Issues from the Federal Courts, 95\nCal. L. Rev. 1243, 1283 (2007) (suggesting that the adjudication of\nthe rights of enemy aliens by law-of-war military commissions might\nbe better understood as exercising the President\u2019s power to conduct\nwar, not judicial power). And, of course, this Court\u2019s appellate\njurisdiction does not allow it to directly review decisions of the\nExecutive Branch that do not \u201cassume such a form that the judicial\npower is capable of acting on [them].\u201dOsbornv.Bank of\nUnited States, 9 Wheat. 738, 819 (1824).",
