S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-1114GARY BRADFORD CONE, PETITIONERv.RICKY\nBELL, WARDENon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit[April 28, 2009]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, dissenting.The Court affirms Gary Cone\u2019s\nconviction for beating an elderly couple to death with a blunt\nobject. In so doing, the majority correctly rejects Cone\u2019s argument\nthat his guilty verdict was secured in violation of his rights\nunderBradyv.Maryland,373 U. S. 83(1963). The\nmajority declines, however, to decide whether the same evidence\nthat was insufficient underBradyto overturn his\nconviction provides a basis for overturning his death sentence. The\nmajority instead remands this question to the District Court for\nfurther consideration because it finds that the Court of Appeals\nengaged in a \u201csummary treatment\u201d of Cone\u2019sBradysentencing claim. Seeante, at 25\u201327.I respectfully dissent. The Court of Appeals\u2019\nallegedly \u201csummary treatment\u201d of Cone\u2019s sentencing claim does not\njustify a remand to the District Court. Cone has failed to\nestablish \u201c\u00a0\u2018a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\nbeen disclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing]\nproceeding would have been different,\u2019\u00a0\u201dKylesv.Whitley,514 U. S. 419, 435\n(1995) (quotingUnited Statesv.Bagley,473 U. S. 667, 682\n(1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.)). As a result, I would affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.[Footnote 1]IThis case arises\nfrom a crime spree 28 years ago that began with Cone\u2019s robbery of a\njewelry store in Memphis, Tennessee, and concluded with his robbery\nof a drugstore in Pompano Beach, Florida. Along the way, Cone shot\na police officer and a bystander while trying to escape the first\nrobbery, attempted to shoot another man in a failed carjacking\nattempt, unsuccessfully tried to force his way into a woman\u2019s\napartment at gunpoint, and murdered 93-year-old Shipley Todd and\nhis 79-year-old wife, Cleopatra. When he was tried on two counts of\nfirst-degree murder in 1982, Cone\u2019s sole defense was that he did\nnot have the requisite intent to commit first-degree murder because\nhe was in the grip of a chronic amphetamine psychosis. The jury\nrejected the defense and convicted Cone of both murders.At sentencing,\nthe Tennessee jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that four\nstatutory aggravating factors applied to Cone\u2019s offense: (1) Cone\nhad been convicted of one or more previous felonies involving the\nuse or threat of violence; (2) he had knowingly created a great\nrisk of death to two or more persons other than the victim during\nhis act of murder; (3) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious\nor cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind; and (4)\nthe murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding a lawful\narrest. Tr. 2151\u20132152 (Apr. 23, 1982); see alsoStatev.Cone, 665 S.\u00a0W. 2d 87, 94\u201396 (Tenn. 1984). Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a739\u20132-203(i) (1982).[Footnote\n2] Cone argued to the jury at sentencing that his \u201ccapacity \u2026\nto appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his\nconduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired\nas a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was\ninsufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which\nsubstantially affected his judgment.\u201d See \u00a739\u20132-203(j)(8). But the\njury found that neither this, nor any other mitigating factor,\noutweighed the aggravating factors. The jury, as required by\nTennessee law, unanimously sentenced Cone to death. See\n\u00a739\u20132-203(g).For almost three decades,\nCone\u2019s case has traveled through the Tennessee and federal courts.\nThis Court has twice reversed decisions from the Court of Appeals\nthat invalidated Cone\u2019s conviction and sentence. SeeBellv.Cone,535 U. S. 685(2002);Bellv.Cone,543 U. S. 447(2005)(per curiam). On remand from this Court\u2019s latest decision,\nthe Court of Appeals directly considered whether a handful of\npolice reports, law enforcement bulletins, and notes that were\nallegedly withheld from Cone\u2019s trial attorneys could have changed\nthe result of Cone\u2019s trial or sentencing. And, for the second time,\nthe Court of Appeals held that there was not a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable\nprobability\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the evidence would have altered the jury\u2019s\nconclusion \u201cthat Cone\u2019s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific\nintent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability\nsufficient to avoid the death sentence.\u201d 492 F.\u00a03d 743, 757\n(CA6 2007). The Court of Appeals, therefore, held that neither\nCone\u2019s conviction nor his sentence was invalid. Seeibid.;Conev.Bell, 243 F.\u00a03d 961, 968 (CA6 2001).\nWe should affirm the Court of Appeals and put an end to this\nlitigation.IIAccording to the\nmajority, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming Cone\u2019s death\nsentence is too \u201csummary,\u201dante, at 25, and the facts are\nsuch that, on further examination, Cone \u201cmight\u201d be able to\ndemonstrate that it is \u201cpossible\u201d that the contested evidence would\nhave persuaded the jury to spare his life,ante,at 25\u201326.\nOn this reasoning, the majority remands the case directly to the\nDistrict Court for \u201cfull consideration [of] the merits of Cone\u2019s\n[sentencing] claim.\u201dAnte,at 27. I disagree on all\ncounts. Remanding the sentencing issue to the District Court is an\n\u201cunusual step\u201d for this Court to take.Housev.Bell,547\nU. S. 518, 557 (2006) (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). Furthermore, in this case, it is a\nstep that is legally and factually unjustified. There is not\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\u2019\u00a0\u201dKyles, 514 U. S., at 433\u2013434\n(quotingBagley, 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun,\nJ.)).AThe majority\u2019s\ncriticism of the Court of Appeals\u2019 allegedly \u201csummary treatment\u201d of\nthe sentencing question is misplaced. Before the Court of Appeals,\nCone dedicated eight pages of his opening brief to arguing that the\nimplicated evidence was material to his guilt or innocence, but\nspent only one paragraph arguing its materiality to his death\nsentence. See Brief for Appellant in No. 99\u20135279 (CA6), pp. 40\u201348.\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 focus on the guilt phase, rather than the\nsentencing phase, simply followed Cone\u2019s lead. See 492 F. 3d, at\n755 (\u201cIn his most recent brief, claiming that his receiving the\nwithheld evidence would have resulted in a different sentence, Cone\nhas made only conclusory arguments\u201d).[Footnote 3] There is nothing defective about a judicial\ndecision that summarily rejects an abbreviated legal argument,\nespecially where, as here, the burden of proving the materiality of\nthe contested evidence was on Cone.[Footnote 4]BIn remanding this\nmatter to the District Court, the majority makes two critical\nerrors\u2014one legal and one factual\u2014that leave the false impression\nthat Cone\u2019sBradyclaim has a chance of success. First,\nthe majority states that \u201c[i]t ispossiblethat the\nsuppressed evidence\u201d may have convinced the jury that Cone\u2019s\nsubstance abuse played a mitigating role in his crime and \u201c[t]he\nevidencemightalso have rebutted the State\u2019s suggestion\u201d\nthat Cone\u2019s experts were inaccurately depicting the depth of his\ndrug-induced impairment.Ante, at 26 (emphasis added); see\nalsoante,at 26\u201327 (remanding \u201c[b]ecause the evidence\nsuppressed at Cone\u2019s trialmay well have beenmaterial to\nthe jury\u2019s assessment of the proper punishment in this case\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But, as the majority implicitly acknowledges,\nseeante, at 26, n.\u00a019, this is not the correct legal\ntest for evaluating aBradyclaim: \u201cThe mere possibility\nthat an item of undisclosed informationmighthave helped\nthe defense, ormighthave affected the outcome of the\ntrial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional\nsense.\u201dUnited Statesv.Agurs,427 U. S. 97, 109\u2013110\n(1976) (emphasis added).Rather,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this Court has made clear that the legal standard\nfor adjudicating such a claim is whether there is a \u201creasonable\nprobability\u201d that the jury would have been persuaded by the\nallegedly withheld evidence.Kyles,supra, at\n435;Bagley,supra, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun,\nJ.). It simply is not sufficient, therefore, to claim that \u201cthere\nis a reasonablepossibilitythat \u2026 testimony might have\nproduced a different result \u2026\u00a0. [P]etitioner\u2019s burden is to\nestablish a reasonableprobabilityof a different result.\u201dStricklerv.Greene,527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999) (emphasis in\noriginal). To satisfy the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard, Cone\nmust show that \u201cthe favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to\nput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine\nconfidence\u201d in the jury\u2019s sentencing determination.Kyles,supra, at 435. The Court must view the record \u201cas a\nwhole,\u201dSawyerv.Whitley,505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (Stevens,\nJ., concurring in judgment), and determine whether the absence of\nthe disclosure prevented Cone from receiving \u201c\u00a0\u2018a trial\nresulting in a [sentence] worthy of confidence.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStrickler,supra, at 290 (quotingKyles,\n514 U. S., at 434).In the context of this case,\nfor Cone to establish \u201c\u00a0\u2018a reasonable probability that, had\nthe evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\n[sentencing] proceeding would have been different,\u2019\u00a0\u201did., at 435, he must not only demonstrate that the\nwithheld evidence would have established that he was substantially\nimpaired as a result of drug abuse or withdrawal; Cone also must\nestablish that the addition of the allegedly withheld evidence\nultimately would have led the jury to conclude that any mitigating\nfactors (including substantial impairment) outweighed all of the\nestablished aggravating factors. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a739\u20132-203(g).[Footnote\n5]Second, the majority\nincorrectly claims that to prevail on hisBradyclaim,\nCone must demonstrate simply that the withheld evidence supported\nthe inference that he \u201cwas impaired by his use of drugs around the\ntime his crimes were committed.\u201d Seeante, at 21. This is\nfactually inaccurate because there was already significant evidence\nof Cone\u2019s drug use at trial. To establish that the allegedly\nwithheld evidence would reasonably have had any impact on his case,\nCone must instead show that the evidence would have supported his\nclaim ofsubstantialmental impairment from drug\nuse.There was extensive evidence\nat trial that supported the inference that Cone was not only a\nlongstanding drug user, but that he was in fact using drugs at the\ntime of his crimes. The State itself presented significant evidence\non this point. For example, it presented proof that officers found\nmarijuana cigarette butts, empty drug vials, and loose syringes in\nthe car that Cone abandoned immediately after the jewelry store\nrobbery. Tr. 1505\u20131509 (Apr. 19, 1982). The State also did not\nchallenge testimony from Cone\u2019s mother that Cone used drugs.Id., at 1647, 1648\u20131653 (Apr. 20, 1982). And, most\ntellingly, the State introduced evidence that Cone was abusing\nthree drugs\u2014cocaine, Dilaudid, and Demerol\u2014at the time of his\narrest and was suffering \u201cslight withdrawal symptoms\u201d from them.Id., at 1915\u20131916, 1920 (Apr. 22, 1982). As the Court of\nAppeals explained, \u201c[i]t would not have been news to the jurors,\nthat Cone was a \u2018drug user.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 492 F.\u00a03d, at\n757.[Footnote 6]In contrast, whatwascontested by the State during trial was Cone\u2019s defense that his\ndrug use was so significant that it caused him to suffer from\nextreme amphetamine psychosis at the time of the murders. One of\nCone\u2019s expert witnesses, a neuropharmacologist, testified that by\nthe summer of 1980, when the crimes occurred, Cone was ingesting\n\u201cferociously large doses\u201d of drugs and that his increasing\ntolerance and use of amphetamines caused a chronic amphetamine\npsychosis. Tr. 1736\u20131737, 1744\u20131747, 1758\u20131759 (Apr. 21, 1982). The\nexpert further testified that if a person with chronic amphetamine\npsychosis were to go into withdrawal, he could suffer extreme mood\nswings, \u201ca crashing depression,\u201d and a state of weakness so severe\nthat \u201che could barely lift himself.\u201dId., at 1857\u20131859. In\nthis expert\u2019s view, these symptoms could cause a person to \u201close\nhis mind.\u201dId., at 1859.The State contradicted that\ntestimony with significant evidence that Cone did not act like\nsomeone who was \u201cout of his mind\u201d during the commission of his\ncrimes. Rather, the State argued, Cone behaved rationally during\nhis initial Tennessee robbery, his subsequent escape, his flight\nfrom Tennessee to Florida after the Todd murders, his Florida\nrobbery, and his subsequent arrest. See,e.g.,id.,at 2074\u20132084 (Apr. 22, 1982). To substantiate this\nargument, the State called FBI Special Agent Eugene Flynn to the\nstand. Agent Flynn testified that, when captured, Cone coherently\ndetailed his travel from Tennessee to Florida, explained his\nefforts to evade detection by shaving his beard and buying new\nclothes, and initiated negotiations for a plea bargain.Id., at 1918\u20131921. The State also presented testimony from\na friend of Cone\u2019s, Ilene Blankman, that she saw no indication that\nCone was under the influence of drugs or severe withdrawal in the\ndays immediately following the murder of the Todds.Id.,at 1875\u20131876, 1882\u20131883 (Apr. 21, 1982).Viewing the record as a whole,\nthen, it is apparent that the contested issue at trial and\nsentencing was not whether Cone used drugs, but rather the quantity\nof Cone\u2019s drug use and its effect on his mental state. Only if the\nevidence allegedly withheld from Cone was relevant tothisquestion whether Cone suffered from extreme amphetamine psychosis\nor other substantial impairment would the evidence have been\nexculpatory for purposes ofBrady. See Order Denying\nMotion for Evidentiary Hearing and Order of Partial Dismissal,Conev.Bell, No. 97\u20132312\u2013M1/A (WD Tenn., May 15,\n1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n. 9 (explaining that \u201cthe\nissue at trial was not whether Cone had ever abused any drugs (he\nclearly had), but whether he was out of his mind on amphetamines at\nthe time of the murders\u201d); Tr. 2115\u20132116 (Apr. 23,\n1982).IIIWith the legal\nand factual issues correctly framed, it becomes clear that Cone\ncannot establish a reasonable probability that admission of the\nevidence\u2014viewed either individually or cumulatively\u2014would have\ncaused the jury to alter his sentence.A1Cone first argues\nthat he was improperly denied police reports that included witness\nstatements regarding Cone\u2019s behavior around the time of his crime\nspree. The first statement was given by a convenience store\nemployee, Robert McKinney, who saw Cone the day before he robbed\nthe Tennessee jewelry store. When asked whether Cone appeared \u201cto\nbe drunk or high on anything,\u201d McKinney answered, \u201c[w]ell he did,\nhe acted real weird \u2026 he just wandered around the store.\u201d App. 49.\nBut McKinney subsequently clarified that Cone \u201cdidn\u2019t sound drunk\u201d\nand that the reason Cone attracted his attention was because he\n\u201cwasn\u2019t acting like a regular customer\u201d; he was \u201cjust kinda\nwandering\u201d around the store. Motion to Expand the Record in No.\n97\u20132312\u2013M1 (WD Tenn.), Exh. 2, pp.\u00a03, 4. Contrary to the\nmajority\u2019s assertion, this interview is not convincing evidence\n\u201cthat Cone appeared to be \u2018drunk or high\u2019\u00a0\u201d when McKinney saw\nhim.Ante, at 21. McKinney\u2019s clarification that he had\ncharacterized Cone\u2019s behavior as \u201cweird\u201d because Cone appeared to\nbe killing time rather than acting like a normal shopper undermines\nthe implication of McKinney\u2019s earlier statement that Cone looked\n\u201cweird\u201d because he might have been drunk or on drugs. Thus, there\nis little chance that McKinney\u2019s statement would have provided any\nsignificant additional evidence that Cone was using drugs, let\nalone provide sentence-changing evidence that he was substantially\nimpaired due to amphetamine psychosis.The second\nstatement was given by Charles and Debbie Slaughter, who both\nwitnessed Cone fleeing from police after the jewelry store robbery\nand reportedly told police that he looked \u201cwild eyed.\u201d App. 50.\nCone had just robbed a jewelry store, shot a police officer and a\nbystander, and was still fleeing from police when seen by the\nSlaughters. It is thus unlikely that their observation of a \u201cwild\neyed\u201d man would have been interpreted by the jury to mean that Cone\n\u201cwas suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis at the time of\nthe crimes,\u201dante, at 21, n.\u00a016, rather than to mean\nthat Cone looked like a man on the run.The third statement is\ncontained in a police report authored by an officer who helped\napprehend Cone after the Florida drugstore robbery. He reported\nthat he saw a suspect \u201cat the rear of Sambos restaurant. Subject\nwas observed to be looking about in a frenzied manner and also\nappeared to be looking for a place to run.\u201d App. 53. Nothing in\nthis police report either connects Cone to drug use or appears\notherwise capable of altering the jury\u2019s understanding of Cone\u2019s\nmental state at the time of the crimes. It certainly makes perfect\nsense that Cone was \u201clooking about in a frenzied manner,\u201dibid.;he had just robbed a drugstore and was about to\nengage in a gun battle with police in order to evade arrest. The\npolice officer\u2019s description of Cone\u2019s appearance under these\ncircumstances thus does not \u201cundermine confidence\u201d in Cone\u2019s\nsentence.Kyles, 514 U. S., at 435.2The next category\nof documents that Cone relies upon to establish hisBradyclaim are police bulletins. Some of the bulletins were sent by\nMemphis Police Sergeant Roby to neighboring jurisdictions on the\nday of the Todd murders and the day after. The bulletins sought\nCone\u2019s apprehension and alternatively described him as a \u201cdrug\nuser\u201d or a \u201cheavy drug user.\u201d App. 55\u201358. Cone asserts that he\ncould have used these bulletins to impeach Sergeant Roby\u2019s trial\ntestimony that the sergeant did not see any track marks when\nvisiting Cone in jail a week later. Tr. 1939 (Apr. 22, 1982).\nCone\u2019s reasoning is faulty for two key reasons. First, Sergeant\nRoby never testified that Cone was not a drug user. His only trial\ntestimony on this point was simply that he observed no \u201cneedle\nmarks\u201d on Cone\u2019s arm when taking hair samples from him a few days\nafter Cone\u2019s apprehension.Ibid.Second, the bulletins\nestablish only \u201cthat the police were initially cautious regarding\nthe characteristics of a person who had committed several heinous\ncrimes.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n. 9. The bulletins would not\nhave tended to prove that the fugitive Cone was, in fact, a heavy\ndrug user\u2014let alone \u201cout of his mind\u201d or otherwise substantially\nimpaired due to amphetamine psychosis\u2014at the time of his\ncrimes.[Footnote 7]3Cone also argues\nthat material was withheld that could have been used to impeach\nIlene Blankman\u2019s testimony that Cone did not appear to be high or\nin withdrawal when she helped him obtain a Florida driver\u2019s license\nduring his efforts to evade arrest in Florida. Tr. 1875\u20131882 (Apr.\n21, 1982). But he again fails to meet the standard for exculpatory\nevidence set byBrady.Cone first points\nto police notes of a pre-trial interview with Blankman, which did\nnot reflect the statement she gave at trial that she saw no track\nmarks on Cone\u2019s arm. App. 72\u201373. But Blankman was questioned at\ntrial about her failure to initially disclose this fact to police,\nTr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982), so the jury was fully aware of the\nomission. Disclosure of the original copy of the police notes thus\ncould not have had any material effect on the jury\u2019s deliberations.\nMoreover, the missing notes also recorded a damning statement by\nBlankman that Cone \u201cnever used drugs around\u201d her and she \u201cnever saw\nCone with drug paraphernalia.\u201d App. 73. Thus, it is difficult to\naccept Cone\u2019s argument that he would have benefited from the\nintroduction of notes from Blackman\u2019s pretrial interview. If\nanything, these police notes would have undermined his mitigation\nargument.Cone next relies on a report\nthat describes a woman\u2019s confrontation with the prosecution team\nand Blankman at a restaurant during trial. During the encounter,\nthe woman accused Blankman of lying on the stand in order to frame\nCone for the murders.Id.,at 74\u201375. The report indicates\nthat the prosecutors politely declined the woman\u2019s numerous\nattempts to discuss the merits of the case and that Blankman said\nnothing.Id.,at 75. Nothing about this encounter raises\ndoubts about Blankman\u2019s credibility.Last, Cone points to\n\u201ccorrespondence in the district attorney\u2019s files suggest[ing] that\nthe prosecution had been unusually solicitous of [Blankman\u2019s]\ntestimony.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 45. But the correspondence was\ncompletely innocuous. One of the notes, sent in response to\nBlankman\u2019s request for a copy of her prior statement, expressed to\nBlankman that her \u201ccooperation in this particular matter is\nappreciated.\u201d App. 76. The prosecutor then sent a letter to confirm\nthat Blankman would testify at trial.Id., at 77. And\nfinally, after trial, the prosecutor sent a note to inform Blankman\nof the verdict and indicate that they \u201ccertainly appreciate[d]\n[her] cooperation with [them] in the trial of Gary Bradford Cone.\u201dId.,at 78. There is nothing about these notes that\n\u201ctend[s] to prove any fact that is both favorable to Cone and\nmaterial to his guilt or punishment.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n116a.BViewing the\nrecord as a whole, Cone has not come close to demonstrating that\nthere is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the withheld evidence,\nanalyzed individually or cumulatively, would have changed the\nresult of his sentencing. Much of the impeachment evidence\nidentified by Cone is of no probative value whatsoever. The police\nbulletins do not contradict any of the trial testimony; the\nrestaurant encounter was innocuous; and the correspondence sent by\nprosecutors to Blankman does not undermine her testimony or call\nCone\u2019s mental state into doubt. If the remaining evidence has any\nvalue to Cone, it is marginal at best. There was testimony that\nBlankman did not initially tell police that Cone lacked track\nmarks. See Tr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982). McKinney clarified in his\nstatement that Cone\u2019s activity in the store was consistent with a\nperson killing time, not the use of drugs or alcohol. And the\nbehavior described by the Slaughters and the Florida police officer\nis more naturally attributable to the circumstances of Cone\u2019s\nflight from the police than to any inference that Cone was \u201cout of\nhis mind\u201d or otherwise substantially impaired due to amphetamine\npsychosis.Countering the\ntrivial value of the allegedBradymaterial is the clear\nand overwhelming evidence that during Cone\u2019s crime spree, he was\nneither sufficiently insane to avoid a conviction of murder nor\nsubstantially impaired by his drug use or withdrawal-related\npsychosis. There was substantial evidence that Cone carefully\nplanned the jewelry store robbery and was calm in carrying it out,\nTr. at 974\u2013976, 1014 (Apr. 16, 1982), 1350\u20131352 (Apr. 17, 1982),\n1501 (Apr. 19, 1982), 2075 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he successfully\neluded police after engaging them in a shootout,id., at\n1053\u20131064 (Apr. 16, 1982); that, after hiding overnight, he\nconcocted a ruse to try to gain illegal entry to a residence,id., at 1205\u20131208 (Apr. 17, 1982); that he murdered the\nTodds after they declined to cooperate with his efforts to further\nelude police,id., at 1681 (Apr. 20, 1982); that he took\nsteps to change his appearance at the Todd residence and then\nsuccessfully fled to Florida,id., at 1918\u20131919 (Apr. 22,\n1982); that he arrived in Florida exhibiting no signs of drug use\nor severe withdrawal,id., at 1875\u20131882 (Apr. 21, 1982);\nthat he obtained false identification in a further effort to avoid\napprehension,id., at 1881\u20131882, and that he denied any\nmemory lapses and described undergoing only minor drug withdrawal\nwhen police arrested him,id., at 1919\u20131920 (Apr. 22,\n1982). Given this wealth of evidence, there is no \u201creasonable\nprobability\u201d that the jury would have found that Cone was entitled\nto the substantial impairment mitigator had the evidence he seeks\nbeen made available to him.And even if Cone could have\npresented this evidence to the jury at sentencing and established\nan entitlement to this mitigator, he still has not demonstrated a\nreasonable probability that it would have outweighed all of the\naggravating factors supporting the jury\u2019s death sentence. Seeid.,at 2151\u20132154 (Apr. 23, 1982). In its decision on\ndirect appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court was well aware of the\nevidence regarding the \u201cdegree and extent of [Cone\u2019s] drug abuse.\u201dCone, 665 S.\u00a0W. 2d, at 90. As part of its required\nindependent review of whether the mitigation evidence was\nsufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating factors, see\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u20132-205, the Tennessee court nevertheless\nconcluded that the sentence was \u201cnot in any way disproportionate\nunder all of the circumstances, including the brutal murders of two\nelderly defenseless persons by an escaping armed robber who had\nterrorized a residential neighborhood for twenty-four hours.\u201d 665\nS.\u00a0W. 2d, at 95\u201396. None of Cone\u2019s proffered evidence places\nthat conclusion, made by both the jury and the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt, \u201cin such a different light as to undermine confidence\u201d in\nCone\u2019s sentence.Kyles, 514 U. S., at 435; see alsoStrickler, 527 U. S., at 296.IVThis Court should\nnot vacate and remand lower court decisions based on nothing more\nthan the vague suspicion that error might be present, or because\nthe court below could have been more clear. This is especially so\nwhere, as here, the record before the Court is adequate to evaluate\nCone\u2019sBradyclaims with respect to both the guilt and\nsentencing phases of his trial. The Court\u2019s willingness to return\nthe sentencing issue to the District Court without any firm\nconviction that an error was committed by the Court of Appeals is\ninconsistent with our established practice and disrespectful to the\nlower courts that have considered this case. Worse still, the\ninevitable result will be years of additional delay in the\nexecution of a death sentence lawfully imposed by a Tennessee jury.\nBecause I would affirm the judgment below, I respectfully\ndissent.Footnote\n1Because I would affirm on the\nbasis of the Court of Appeals\u2019 alternative holding below, I do not\nreach the issues of procedural default resolved by the majority.\nSeeUnited Statesv.Atlantic Research Corp.,551 U. S. 128,\n141, n. 8 (2007);Ayottev.Planned Parenthood of\nNorthern New Eng.,546 U. S. 320, 332\n(2006);Ardestaniv.INS,502 U. S. 129, 139\n(1991).Footnote\n2The Tennessee Supreme Court\nlater concluded that the record in Cone\u2019s case was doubtful as to\nevidence supporting the second circumstance given the lapse in time\nbetween the initial events of the escape and the Todd murders.Cone, 665 S.\u00a0W. 2d, at 95. The court, however,\ndetermined that the existence of the other three factors rendered\nany possible error in this factor harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.Ibid.Footnote\n3The assertion by the\nmajority,ante, at 26, n.\u00a019, and Justice Alito,ante, at 8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\npart), that the Court of Appeals did not address the merits of the\nsentencing issue at all is flatly wrong. See 492 F.\u00a03d, at 757\n(rejecting Cone\u2019sBradyclaim because the proffered\nevidence would not have altered the jury\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat Cone\u2019s\nprior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to murder his\nvictimsand did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to\navoid the death sentence\u201d (emphasis added)).Footnote\n4The majority does not attempt\nto justify its remand by contending that it is necessary because\nthe record is insufficient to decide the claim. Nor could it\npersuasively contend a remand is necessary so that the District\nCourt can hold an evidentiary hearing. Such a hearing would shed no\nadditional light on the trial proceedings or the relative\nimpeachment value of the withheld documents. Cone himself agrees\nthat \u201cthis Court should resolve the merits of [his]Bradyclaim.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 24; see also Brief for\nRespondent 26\u201327.Footnote\n5The majority\nasserts that the standard under Tennessee law for demonstrating\nmental defect or intoxication as a mitigating factor at sentencing\nis \u201cfar lesser\u201d than the standard for demonstrating insanity in the\nguilt phase of a criminal trial.Ante, at 25. But the\nmitigating factor still requires a showing that Cone\u2019s mental\ncapacity was \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d as a result of mental defect.\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u20132-203(j)(8). In any event, the only authority\ncited by the majority for its assertion that the standard is \u201cfar\u201d\nlesser than that for insanity is Justice Stevens\u2019 lone dissent in a\nprior appeal in this case.Ante, at 25.Footnote 6Although\nthere were two occasions during closing arguments where prosecutors\nintimated that Cone was not a drug user, see Tr. 2014\u20132015, 2068\n(Apr. 22, 1982), the State\u2019s argument otherwise consistently\nfocused on the real issue in the case: that Cone was not so\nsignificantly affected by his drug use around the time of his\ncrimes that he was \u201cout of his mind\u201d or \u201cdrug crazy\u201d during the\ncritical days of August 1980. Seeid., at 2023\u20132024,\n2071\u20132084. The majority\u2019s focus on two brief excerpts from the\nState\u2019s closing argument fails to faithfully view the record \u201cas a\nwhole\u201d for purposes of aBradyanalysis. SeeSawyerv.Whitley,505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (Stevens,\nJ., concurring in judgment); see alsoStricklerv.Greene,527 U. S. 263, 290\u2013291 (1999) (finding\nno reasonable probability of a different result even when\nprosecutor\u2019s closing argument relied on testimony that could have\nbeen impeached by withheld material).Footnote 7Alert\nbulletins sent by the FBI similarly identified Cone as a \u201cbelieved\nheavy drug user\u201d or a \u201cdrug user.\u201d App. 62\u201370. Cone argues that\nthese bulletins could have been used to impeach FBI Agent Flynn\u2019s\ntestimony about Cone\u2019s arrest in Florida. The bulletins would not\nhave constituted material impeachment evidence, however, for the\nsecond reason identified above. In addition, the bulletins would\nnot have contradicted any of FBI Agent Flynn\u2019s testimony; he in\nfact stated at trial that Cone reported using three drugs and was\nundergoing mild drug withdrawal when he was captured in Florida.\nTr. 1915\u20131916 (Apr. 22, 1982).",
