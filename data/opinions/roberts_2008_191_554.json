ROTHGERY, PETITIONERv.GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXASon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2008]Chief Justice Roberts, with whom\nJustice Scalia joins, concurring.Justice Thomas\u2019s analysis of the\npresent issue is compelling, but I believe the result here is\ncontrolled byBrewerv.Williams,430 U. S. 387(1977),\nandMichiganv.Jackson,475 U. S. 625(1986). A\nsufficient case has not been made for revisiting those precedents,\nand accordingly I join the Court\u2019s opinion.I also join Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence, which\ncorrectly distinguishes between the time the right to counsel\nattaches and the circumstances under which counsel must be\nprovided.",
