S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-322NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTILITY DIS- TRICT\nNUMBER ONE, APPELLANTv.ERIC H. HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY\nGENERAL, et\u00a0al.on appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia[June 22, 2009]Justice Thomas, concurring in the\njudgment in part and dissenting in part.This appeal presents two\nquestions: first, whether appellant is entitled to bail out from\ncoverage under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA); and second,\nwhether the preclearance requirement of \u00a75 of the VRA is\nunconstitutional. Because the Court\u2019s statutory decision does not\nprovide appellant with full relief, I conclude that it is\ninappropriate to apply the constitutional avoidance doctrine in\nthis case. I would therefore decide the constitutional issue\npresented and hold that \u00a75 exceeds Congress\u2019 power to enforce the\nFifteenth Amendment.IThe doctrine of constitutional\navoidance factors heavily in the Court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\nis eligible for bailout as a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d under \u00a74(a) of\nthe VRA. Seeante, at 11. Regardless of the Court\u2019s\nresolution of the statutory question, I am in full agreement that\nthis case raises serious questions concerning the constitutionality\nof \u00a75 of the VRA. But, unlike the Court, I do not believe that the\ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance is applicable here. The\nultimate relief sought in this case is not bailout eligibility\u2014it\nis bailout itself. See First Amended Complaint in No. 06\u20131384\n(DDC), p.\u00a08, Record, Doc. 83 (\u201cPlaintiff requests the Court to\ndeclare that the district has met the bail-out requirements of \u00a74\nof the [VRA] and that the preclearance requirements of \u00a75 \u2026 no\nlonger apply to the district; or, in the alternative, that \u00a75 of\nthe Act as applied to the district is an unconstitutional\noverextension of Congress\u2019s enforcement power to remedy past\nviolations of the Fifteenth Amendment\u201d).Eligibility for bailout turns on\nthe statutory question addressed by the Court\u2014the proper definition\nof \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the bailout clauses of \u00a74(a) of the\nVRA. Entitlement to bailout, however, requires a covered \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d to submit substantial evidence indicating that it is\nnot engaging in \u201cdiscrimination in voting on account of race,\u201d see\n42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973b(a)(3). The Court properly declines to give\nappellant bailout because appellant has not yet proved its\ncompliance with the statutory requirements for such relief. See\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)\u2013(3). In fact, the record below shows that appellant\u2019s\nfactual entitlement to bailout is a vigorously contested issue.\nSee,e.g., NAACP\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\nin No. 06\u20131384 (DDC), pp.\u00a0490\u2013492, Record, Doc. 100; Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s Statement of Uncontested Material Facts in No. 06\u20131384\n(DDC), \u00b6\u00b619, 59, Record, Doc. 98. Given its resolution of the\nstatutory question, the Court has thus correctly remanded the case\nfor resolution of appellant\u2019s factual entitlement to bailout. Seeante, at 16.But because the Court is not in a position to\naward appellant bailout, adjudication of the constitutionality of\n\u00a75, in my view, cannot be avoided. \u201cTraditionally, the avoidance\ncanon was not a doctrine under which courts read statutes to avoid\nmere constitutional doubts. Instead, it commanded courts, when\nfaced with two plausible constructions of a statute\u2014one\nconstitutional and the other unconstitutional\u2014to choose the\nconstitutional reading.\u201dClarkv.Martinez,543 U. S. 371,\n395 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting). To the extent that\nconstitutional avoidance is a worthwhile tool of statutory\nconstruction, it is because it allows a court to dispose of an\nentire case on grounds that do not require the court to pass on a\nstatute\u2019s constitutionality. SeeAshwanderv.TVA,297 U.\nS. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Court will\nnot pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented\nby the record, if there is also some other ground upon which the\ncase may be disposed of\u201d); see also,e.g.,Mayor of\nPhiladelphiav.Educational Equality League,415 U. S. 605, 629\n(1974). The doctrine \u201cavoids decision of constitutional questions\nwhere possible, and it permits one lawsuit, rather than two, to\nresolve the entire controversy.\u201d C. Wright, The Law of Federal\nCourts \u00a719, p. 104 (4th ed. 1983). Absent a determination that\nappellant is not just eligible for bailout, but is entitled to it,\nthis case will not have been entirely disposed of on a\nnonconstitutional ground. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[I]f the Court\nwere to give us bailout \u2026 the Court might choose on its own not to\nreach the constitutional issues because we would receive relief\u201d).\nInvocation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is therefore\ninappropriate in this case.The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is\nalso unavailable here because an interpretation of \u00a74(a) that\nmerely makes more political subdivisionseligiblefor\nbailout does not render \u00a75 constitutional and the Court notably\ndoes not suggest otherwise. SeeClark,supra, at\n396 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Bailout eligibility is a distant\nprospect for most covered jurisdictions. To obtain bailout a\ncovered jurisdiction must satisfy numerous objective criteria. It\nmust show that during the previous 10 years: (A) no \u201ctest or device\nhas been used within such State or political subdivision for the\npurpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to\nvote on account of race or color\u201d; (B) \u201cno final judgment of any\ncourt of the United States \u2026 has determined that denials or\nabridgments of the right to vote on account of race or color have\noccurred anywhere in the territory of\u201d the covered jurisdiction;\n(C) \u201cno Federal examiners or observers \u2026 have been assigned to\u201d the\ncovered jurisdiction; (D) the covered jurisdiction has fully\ncomplied with \u00a75; and (E) \u201cthe Attorney General has not interposed\nany objection (that has not been overturned by a final judgment of\na court) and no declaratory judgment has been denied under [\u00a75].\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(A)\u2013(E). The jurisdiction also has the burden of\npresenting \u201cevidence of minority participation, including evidence\nof the levels of minority group registration and voting, changes in\nsuch levels over time, and disparities between minority-group and\nnon-minority-group participation.\u201d \u00a71973b(a)(2).These extensive requirements may be difficult\nto satisfy, see Brief for Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue asAmicus Curiae20\u201326, but at least they are objective. The\ncovered jurisdiction seeking bailout must also meet subjective\ncriteria: it must \u201c(i) have eliminated voting procedures and\nmethods of election which inhibit or dilute equal access to the\nelectoral process; (ii) have engaged in constructive efforts to\neliminate intimidation and harassment of persons exercising rights\nprotected [under the Act]; and (iii) have engaged in other\nconstructive efforts, such as expanded opportunity for convenient\nregistration and voting for every person of voting age and the\nappointment of minority persons as election officials throughout\nthe jurisdiction and at all stages of the election and registration\nprocess.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(i)\u2013(iii).As a result, a covered jurisdiction meeting\neach of the objective conditions could nonetheless be denied\nbailout because it has not, in the subjective view of the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia, engaged in\nsufficiently \u201cconstructive efforts\u201d to expand voting opportunities,\n\u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(iii). Congress, of course, has complete authority\nto set the terms of bailout. But its promise of a bailout\nopportunity has, in the great majority of cases, turned out to be\nno more than a mirage. As the Court notes, only a handful \u201cof the\nmore than 12,000 covered political subdivisions \u2026 have successfully\nbailed out of the Act.\u201dAnte, at 16;[Footnote 1] see Williamson, The 1982 Amendments\nto the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analysis of the Revised\nBailout Provisions, 62 Wash. U.\u00a0L.\u00a0Q. 1, 42 (1984)\n(explaining that \u201cthe conditions for termination of coverage have\nbeen made so restrictive that bailout will continue to be\nimpossible for most jurisdictions\u201d). Accordingly, bailout\neligibility does not eliminate the issue of \u00a75\u2019s\nconstitutionality.IIThe Court quite properly alerts\nCongress that \u00a75 tests the outer boundaries of its Fifteenth\nAmendment enforcement authority and may not be constitutional. Seeante, at 7\u20139. And, although I respect the Court\u2019s careful\napproach to this weighty issue, I nevertheless believe it is\nnecessary to definitively resolve that important question. For the\nreasons set forth below, I conclude that the lack of current\nevidence of intentional discrimination with respect to voting\nrenders \u00a75 unconstitutional. The provision can no longer be\njustified as an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of the\nFifteenth Amendment.A\u201cThe government of the United\nStates is one of delegated powers alone. Its authority is defined\nand limited by the Constitution. All powers not granted to it by\nthat instrument are reserved to the States or the people.\u201dUnited Statesv.Cruikshank,92 U. S. 542, 551 (1876);\nsee alsoU. S. Term Limits, Inc.v.Thornton,514 U. S. 779,\n848 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting). In the specific area of voting\nrights, this Court has consistently recognized that the\nConstitution gives the States primary authority over the\nstructuring of electoral systems. See,e.g.,Whitev.Weiser,412 U. S. 783, 795\n(1973);Burnsv.Richardson,384 U. S. 73, 84\u201385\n(1966). \u201cNo function is more essential to the separate and\nindependent existence of the States and their governments than the\npower to determine within the limits of the Constitution the\nqualifications of their own voters for state, county, and municipal\noffices and the nature of their own machinery for filling local\npublic offices.\u201dOregonv.Mitchell,400 U. S. 112, 125\n(1970) (opinion of Black, J.).State autonomy with respect to\nthe machinery of self-government defines the States as sovereign\nentities rather than mere provincial outposts subject to every\ndictate of a central governing authority. See U. S. Const., Amdt.\n10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to\nthe States respectively, or to the people\u201d); see alsoAldenv.Maine,527 U. S. 706, 713\n(1999). In the main, the \u201cFramers of the Constitution intended the\nStates to keep for themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment,\nthe power to regulate elections.\u201dGregoryv.Ashcroft,501 U. S. 452, 461\u2013462\n(1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).To be sure, state authority over local\nelections is not absolute under the Constitution. The Fifteenth\nAmendment guarantees that the \u201cright of citizens of the United\nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States\nor by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of\nservitude,\u201d \u00a71, and it grants Congress the authority to \u201cenforce\u201d\nthese rights \u201cby appropriate legislation,\u201d \u00a72. The Fifteenth\nAmendment thus renders unconstitutional any federal or state law\nthat would limit a citizen\u2019s access to the ballot on one of the\nthree bases enumerated in the Amendment. SeeMobilev.Bolden,446 U. S. 55, 65 (1980) (plurality\nopinion) (the Fifteenth Amendment guards against \u201cpurposefully\ndiscriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to\nvote\u201d). Nonetheless, because States still retain sovereign\nauthority over their election systems, any measure enacted in\nfurtherance of the Fifteenth Amendment must be closely examined to\nensure that its encroachment on state authority in this area is\nlimited to the appropriate enforcement of this ban on\ndiscrimination.There is certainly no question that the VRA\ninitially \u201cwas passed pursuant to Congress\u2019 authority under the\nFifteenth Amendment.\u201dLopezv.Monterey County,525 U. S. 266,\n282 (1999). For example, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4(a) seek to implement the\nFifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive command by creating a private\ncause of action to enforce \u00a71 of the Fifteenth Amendment, see\n\u00a71973(a), and by banning discriminatory tests and devices in\ncovered jurisdictions, see \u00a71973b(a); see alsoCity of\nLockhartv.United States,460 U. S. 125, 139\n(1983) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(explaining that \u00a72 reflects Congress\u2019 determination \u201cthat voting\ndiscrimination was a nationwide problem\u201d that called for a \u201cgeneral\nprohibition of discriminatory practices\u201d). Other provisions of the\nVRA also directly enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. See \u00a71973h\n(elimination of poll taxes that effectively deny certain racial\ngroups the right to vote); \u00a71973i(a) (\u201cNo person acting under color\nof law shall fail or refuse to permit any person to vote who is\nentitled to vote \u2026 or willfully fail or refuse to tabulate, count,\nand report such person\u2019s vote\u201d).Section 5, however, was enacted for a\ndifferent purpose: to prevent covered jurisdictions from\ncircumventing the direct prohibitions imposed by provisions such as\n\u00a7\u00a72 and 4(a). SeeRenov.Bossier Parish School\nBd.,520 U. S.\n471, 477 (1997) (explaining that \u00a7\u00a72 and 5 \u201ccombat different\nevils\u201d and \u201cimpose very different duties upon the States\u201d). Section\n5 \u201cwas a response to a common practice in some jurisdictions of\nstaying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new\ndiscriminatory voting laws as soon as the old ones had been struck\ndown. That practice had been possible because each new law remained\nin effect until the Justice Department or private plaintiffs were\nable to sustain the burden of proving that the new law, too, was\ndiscriminatory.\u201dBeerv.United States,425 U. S. 130, 140\n(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).The rebellion against the enfranchisement of\nblacks in the wake of ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment\nillustrated the need for increased federal intervention to protect\nthe right to vote. Almost immediately following Reconstruction,\nblacks attempting to vote were met with coordinated intimidation\nand violence. See,e.g., L. McDonald, A Voting Rights\nOdyssey: Black Enfranchisement in Georgia 34 (2003) (\u201cBy 1872, the\nlegislative and executive branches of state government \u2026 were once\nagain firmly in the control of white Democrats, who resorted to a\nvariety of tactics, including fraud, intimidation, and violence, to\ntake away the vote from blacks, despite ratification of the\nFifteenth Amendment in 1870 \u2026\u201d).[Footnote 2] A soon-to-be victorious mayoral candidate in\nWilmington, North Carolina, for example, urged white voters in an\n1898 election-eve speech: \u201cGo to the polls tomorrow and if you find\nthe negro out voting, tell him to leave the polls, and if he\nrefuses kill him; shoot him down in his tracks.\u201d S. Tolnay & E.\nBeck, A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern Lynchings,\n1882\u20131930, p.\u00a067 (1995).This campaign of violence eventually was\nsupplemented, and in part replaced, by more subtle methods\nengineered to deny blacks the right to vote. SeeSouth\nCarolinav.Katzenbach,383 U. S. 301, 310\u2013312\n(1966). Literacy tests were particularly effective: \u201cas of 1890 in\n\u2026 States [with literacy tests], more than two-thirds of the adult\nNegroes were illiterate while less than one-quarter of the adult\nwhites were unable to read or write,\u201did., at 311, because\n\u201c[p]rior to the Civil War, most of the slave States made it a crime\nto teach Negroes how to read or write,\u201d see alsoid., at\n311, n.\u00a010.[Footnote 3]\nCompounding the tests\u2019 discriminatory impact on blacks, alternative\nvoter qualification laws such as \u201cgrandfather clauses, property\nqualifications, [and] \u2018good character\u2019 tests\u201d were enacted to\nprotect those whites who were unable to pass the literacy tests.Id., at 311; see alsoLopez,supra,at\n297 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201cLiteracy tests were unfairly\nadministered; whites were given easy questions, and blacks were\ngiven more difficult questions, such as the number of bubbles in a\nsoap bar, the news contained in a copy of thePeking\nDaily, the meaning of obscure passages in state constitutions,\nand the definition of terms such ashabeas corpus\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).The Court had declared many of these \u201ctests\nand devices\u201d unconstitutional, seeKatzenbach,supra, at 311\u2013312, but case-by-case eradication was\nwoefully inadequate to ensure that the franchise extended to all\ncitizens regardless of race, seeid., at 328. As a result,\nenforcement efforts before the enactment of \u00a75 had rendered the\nright to vote illusory for blacks in the Jim Crow South. Despite\nthe Civil War\u2019s bloody purchase of the Fifteenth Amendment, \u201cthe\nreality remained far from the promise.\u201dRicev.Cayetano,528 U. S. 495, 512\u2013513\n(2000); see also R. Wardlaw, Negro Suffrage in Georgia, 1867\u20131930,\np.\u00a034 (Phelps-Stokes Fellowship Studies, No.\u00a011, 1932)\n(\u201cSouthern States were setting out to accomplish an effective\nnullification of the war measures of Congress\u201d).Thus, by 1965, Congress had every reason to\nconclude that States with a history of disenfranchising voters\nbased on race would continue to do all they could to evade the\nconstitutional ban on voting discrimination. By that time,\nrace-based voting discrimination had \u201cinfected the electoral\nprocess in parts of our country for nearly a century.\u201dKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Moreover, the massive scale\nof disenfranchisement efforts made case-by-case enforcement of the\nFifteenth Amendment impossible, if not Sisyphean. Seeid.,at 309 (\u201cCongress concluded that the unsuccessful remedies which it\nhad prescribed in the past would have to be replaced by sterner and\nmore elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment\u201d);Rice,supra,\nat 513 (\u201cProgress was slow, particularly when litigation had to\nproceed case by case, district by district, sometimes voter by\nvoter\u201d); Thernstrom, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act: By Now, a\nMurky Mess, 5 Geo. J.\u00a0L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y 41, 44 (2007) (\u201cIn\n1965, it was perfectly reasonable to believe thatanymove\naffecting black enfranchisement in the Deep South was deeply\nsuspect. And only such a punitive measure [as \u00a75] had any hope of\nforcing the South to let blacks vote\u201d (emphasis in original)).It was against this backdrop of \u201chistorical\nexperience\u201d that \u00a75 was first enacted and upheld against a\nconstitutional challenge. SeeKatzenbach,supra,\nat 308. As theKatzenbachCourt explained, \u00a75, which\napplied to those States and political subdivisions that had\nemployed discriminatory tests and devices in the previous\nPresidential election, see 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973b(b), directly\ntargeted the \u201cinsidious and pervasive evil which had been\nperpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and\ningenious defiance of the Constitution.\u201d 383 U. S., at 309; see\nalsoid., at 329 (\u201cCongress began work with reliable\nevidence of actual voting discrimination in a great majority of the\nStates and political subdivisions affected by the new remedies of\nthe Act\u201d). According to the Court, it was appropriate to radically\ninterfere with control over local elections only in those\njurisdictions with a history of discriminatory disenfranchisement\nas those were \u201cthe geographic areas where immediate action seemed\nnecessary.\u201dId., at 328. The Court believed it was thus\n\u201cpermissible to impose the new remedies\u201d on the jurisdictions\ncovered under \u00a74(b) \u201cat least in the absence of proof that they\nha[d] been free of substantial voting discrimination in recent\nyears.\u201dId., at 330.In upholding \u00a75 inKatzenbach, the\nCourt nonetheless noted that the provision was an \u201cuncommon\nexercise of congressional power\u201d that would not have been\n\u201cappropriate\u201d absent the \u201cexceptional conditions\u201d and \u201cunique\ncircumstances\u201d present in the targeted jurisdictions at that\nparticular time.Id.,at 334\u2013335. In reaching its\ndecision, the Court thus refused to simply accept Congress\u2019\nrepresentation that the extreme measure was necessary to enforce\nthe Fifteenth Amendment; rather, it closely reviewed the record\ncompiled by Congress to ensure that \u00a75 was\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018appropriate\u2019\u00a0\u201d antievasion legislation. Seeid.,at 308. In so doing, the Court highlighted\nevidence showing that black voter registration rates ran\napproximately 50 percentage points lower than white voter\nregistration in several States. Seeid.,at 313. It also\nnoted that the registration rate for blacks in Alabama \u201crose only\nfrom 14.2% to 19.4% between 1958 and 1964; in Louisiana it barely\ninched ahead from 31.7% to 31.8% between 1956 and 1965; and in\nMississippi it increased only from 4.4% to 6.4% between 1954 and\n1964.\u201dIbid.The Court further observed that voter turnout\nlevels in covered jurisdictions had been at least 12% below the\nnational average in the 1964 Presidential election. Seeid., at 329\u2013330.The statistical evidence confirmed Congress\u2019\njudgment that \u201cthe extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules\nof various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting\ndiscrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees\u201d was\nworking and could not be defeated through case-by-case enforcement\nof the Fifteenth Amendment.Id.,at 335. This record also\nclearly supported Congress\u2019 predictive judgment that such \u201cStates\nmight try similar maneuvers in the future in order to evade the\nremedies for voting discrimination contained in the Act itself.\u201dIbid.These stark statistics\u2014in conjunction with the\nunrelenting use of discriminatory tests and practices that denied\nblacks the right to vote\u2014constituted sufficient proof of \u201cactual\nvoting discrimination\u201d to uphold the preclearance requirement\nimposed by \u00a75 on the covered jurisdictions as an appropriate\nexercise of congressional power under the Fifteenth Amendment.Id.,at 330. It was only \u201c[u]nder the compulsion of these\nunique circumstances [that] Congress responded in a permissibly\ndecisive manner.\u201dId., at 335.BSeveral important principles\nemerge fromKatzenbachand the decisions that followed it.\nFirst, \u00a75 prohibits more state voting practices than those\nnecessarily encompassed by the explicit prohibition on intentional\ndiscrimination found in the text of the Fifteenth Amendment. The\nexplicit command of the Fifteenth Amendment is a prohibition on\nstate practices that in fact deny individuals the right to vote \u201con\naccount of\u201d race, color, or previous servitude. In contrast, \u00a75 is\nthe quintessential prophylaxis; it \u201cgoes beyond the prohibition of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment by suspendingallchanges to state\nelection law\u2014however innocuous\u2014until they have been precleared by\nfederal authorities in Washington, D.\u00a0C.\u201dAnte, at 7.\nThe Court has freely acknowledged that such legislation is\npreventative, upholding it based on the view that the\nReconstruction Amendments give Congress the power \u201cboth to remedy\nand todeterviolation of rights guaranteed thereunder by\nprohibiting asomewhat broaderswath of conduct, including\nthat which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment\u2019s text.\u201dKimelv.Florida Bd. of Regents,528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000)\n(emphasis added).Second, because it sweeps more\nbroadly than the substantive command of the Fifteenth Amendment, \u00a75\npushes the outer boundaries of Congress\u2019 Fifteenth Amendment\nenforcement authority. SeeMillerv.Johnson,515 U. S. 900,\n926 (1995) (detailing the \u201cfederalism costs exacted by \u00a75\u201d);Presleyv.Etowah County Comm\u2019n,502 U. S. 491, 500\u2013501\n(1992) (describing \u00a75 as \u201can extraordinary departure from the\ntraditional course of relations between the States and the Federal\nGovernment\u201d);City of Romev.United States,446 U. S. 156,\n200 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe preclearance requirement\nboth intrudes on the prerogatives of state and local governments\nand abridges the voting rights of all citizens in States covered\nunder the Act\u201d);Lopez, 525 U. S., at 293 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cSection 5 is a unique requirement that exacts\nsignificant federalism costs\u201d);ante, at 7 (\u201c[Section] 5,\nwhich authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state\nand local policymaking, imposes substantial federalism costs\u00a0\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).Indeed, \u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement is \u201cone\nof the most extraordinary remedial provisions in an Act noted for\nits broad remedies. Even the Department of Justice has described it\nas a \u2018substantial departure \u2026 from ordinary concepts of our federal\nsystem\u2019; its encroachment on state sovereignty is significant and\nundeniable.\u201dUnited Statesv.Sheffield Bd. of\nComm\u2019rs,435 U.\nS. 110, 141 (1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (footnote\nomitted). This \u201cencroachment is especially troubling because it\ndestroys local control of the means of self-government, one of the\ncentral values of our polity.\u201dCity of Rome,supra, at 201 (Powell, J., dissenting). More than 40 years\nafter its enactment, this intrusion has become increasingly\ndifficult to justify.Third, to accommodate the tension between the\nconstitutional imperatives of the Fifteenth and Tenth Amendments\u2014a\nbalance between allowing the Federal Government to patrol state\nvoting practices for discrimination and preserving the States\u2019\nsignificant interest in self-determination\u2014the constitutionality of\n\u00a75 has always depended on the proven existence of intentional\ndiscrimination so extensive that elimination of it through\ncase-by-case enforcement would be impossible. SeeKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308 (\u201cBefore enacting the\nmeasure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial\ndiscrimination in voting\u201d);Katzenbachv.Morgan,384 U. S. 641,\n667 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cCongress made a detailed\ninvestigation of various state practices that had been used to\ndeprive Negroes of the franchise\u201d). \u201cThere can be no remedy without\na wrong. Essential to our holdings in [South Carolinav.]KatzenbachandCity of Romewas our conclusion\nthat Congress was remedying the effects of priorintentionalracial discrimination. In both cases, we\nrequired Congress to have some evidence that the jurisdiction\nburdened with preclearance obligations had actually engaged in such\nintentional discrimination.\u201dLopez,supra, at\n294\u2013295 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).The Court has never deviated from this\nunderstanding. We have explained that prophylactic legislation\ndesigned to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments must \u201cidentify\nconduct transgressing the \u2026 substantive provisions\u201d it seeks to\nenforce and be tailored \u201cto remedying or preventing such conduct.\u201dFlorida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.v.College Savings Bank,527 U. S. 627, 639\n(1999). Congress must establish a \u201chistory and pattern\u201d of\nconstitutional violations to establish the need for \u00a75 by\njustifying a remedy that pushes the limits of its constitutional\nauthority.Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.v.Garrett,531 U. S. 356, 368\n(2001). As a result, for \u00a75 to withstand renewed constitutional\nscrutiny, there must be a demonstrated connection between the\n\u201cremedial measures\u201d chosen and the \u201cevil presented\u201d in the record\nmade by Congress when it renewed the Act.City of Boernev.Flores,521 U. S. 507, 530\n(1997). \u201cStrong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an\nunwarranted response to another, lesser one.\u201dIbid.CThe extensive pattern of\ndiscrimination that led the Court to previously uphold \u00a75 as\nenforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no longer exists. Covered\njurisdictions are not now engaged in a systematic campaign to deny\nblack citizens access to the ballot through intimidation and\nviolence. And the days of \u201cgrandfather clauses, property\nqualifications, \u2018good character\u2019 tests, and the requirement that\nregistrants \u2018understand\u2019 or \u2018interpret\u2019 certain matter,\u201dKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 311, are gone. There is thus\ncurrently no concerted effort in these jurisdictions to engage in\nthe \u201cunremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution,\u201did., at 309, that served as the constitutional basis for\nupholding the \u201cuncommon exercise of congressional power\u201d embodied\nin \u00a75,id.,at 334.The lack of sufficient evidence\nthat the covered jurisdictions currently engage in the type of\ndiscrimination that underlay the enactment of \u00a75 undermines any\nbasis for retaining it. Punishment for long past sins is not a\nlegitimate basis for imposing a forward-looking preventative\nmeasure that has already served its purpose. Those supporting \u00a75\u2019s\nreenactment argue that without it these jurisdictions would return\nto the racially discriminatory practices of 30 and 40 years ago.\nBut there is no evidence that public officials stand ready, if\ngiven the chance, to again engage in concerted acts of violence,\nterror, and subterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting.\nWithout such evidence, the charge can only be premised on outdated\nassumptions about racial attitudes in the covered jurisdictions.\nAdmitting that a prophylactic law as broad as \u00a75 is no longer\nconstitutionally justified based on current evidence of\ndiscrimination is not a sign of defeat. It is an acknowledgment of\nvictory.The current statistical evidence confirms that\nthe emergency that prompted the enactment of \u00a75 has long since\npassed. By 2006, the voter registration rates for blacks in\nAlabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi had jumped to 71.8%, 66.9%, and\n72.2%, respectively. See App. to Brief for Southeastern Legal\nFoundation asAmicus Curiae6a\u20137a (hereinafter SLF Brief).\nTherefore, in contrast to theKatzenbachCourt\u2019s finding\nthat the \u201cregistration of voting-age whites ran roughly 50\npercentage points or more ahead of Negro registration\u201d in these\nStates in 1964, see 383 U. S., at 313, since that time this\ndisparity has nearly vanished. In 2006, the disparity was only 3\npercentage points in Alabama, 8 percentage points in Louisiana, and\nin Mississippi, black voter registration actually exceeded white\nvoter registration by 1.5 percentage points. See App. to SLF Brief\n6a\u20137a. In addition, blacks in these three covered States also have\nhigher registration numbers than the registration rate for whites\nin noncovered states. See E. Blum & L. Campbell, Assessment of\nVoting Rights Progress in Jurisdictions Covered Under Section Five\nof the Voting Rights Act 3\u20136 (American Enterprise Institute, 2006);\nsee also S.\u00a0Rep. No. 109\u2013295, p.\u00a011 (2006) (noting that\n\u201cpresently in seven of the covered States, African-Americans are\nregistered at a rate higher than the national average\u201d; in two\nmore, black registration in the 2004 election was \u201cidentical to the\nnational average\u201d; and in \u201cCalifornia, Georgia, Mississippi, North\nCarolina, and Texas, black registration and turnout in the 2004\nelection \u2026 was higher than that for whites\u201d).Indeed, when reenacting \u00a75 in 2006, Congress\nevidently understood that the emergency conditions which prompted\n\u00a75\u2019s original enactment no longer exist. See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, p.\u00a012 (2006) (\u201cThe record reveals that many of the\nfirst generation barriers to minority voter registration and voter\nturnout that were in place prior to the VRA have been eliminated\u201d).\nInstead of relying on the kind of evidence that theKatzenbachCourt had found so persuasive, Congress instead\nbased reenactment on evidence of what it termed \u201csecond generation\nbarriers constructed to prevent minority voters from fully\nparticipating in the electoral process.\u201d \u00a72(b)(2), 120 Stat. 577.\nBut such evidence is not probative of the type of purposeful\ndiscrimination that prompted Congress to enact \u00a75 in 1965. For\nexample, Congress relied upon evidence of racially polarized voting\nwithin the covered jurisdictions. But racially polarized voting is\nnot evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, seeBolden,446 U. S. 55, is not state action, seeJamesv.Bowman,190 U. S. 127, 136\n(1903), and is not a problem unique to the South, see Katz,\nAisenbrey, Baldwin, Cheuse, & Weisbrodt, Documenting\nDiscrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of The\nVoting Rights Act Since 1982, 39 U. Mich. J.\u00a0L. Reform 643,\n665 (2006). The other evidence relied on by Congress, such as \u00a75\nenforcement actions, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 lawsuits, and federal examiner and\nobserver coverage, also bears no resemblance to the record\ninitially supporting \u00a75, and is plainly insufficient to sustain\nsuch an extraordinary remedy. See SLF Brief 18\u201335. In sum, evidence\nof \u201csecond generation barriers\u201d cannot compare to the prevalent and\npervasive voting discrimination of the 1960\u2019s.This is not to say that voter discrimination\nis extinct. Indeed, the District Court singled out a handful of\nexamples of allegedly discriminatory voting practices from the\nrecord made by Congress. See,e.g.,Northwest Austin\nMunicipal Util. Dist. No. Onev.Mukasey,573 F.\nSupp. 2d. 221, 252\u2013254, 256\u2013262 (DDC 2008). But the existence of\ndiscrete and isolated incidents of interference with the right to\nvote has never been sufficient justification for the imposition of\n\u00a75\u2019s extraordinary requirements. From its inception, the statute\nwas promoted as a measure needed to neutralize a coordinated and\nunrelenting campaign to deny an entire race access to the ballot.\nSeeCity of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 526 (concluding thatKatzenbachconfronted a \u201cwidespread and persisting\ndeprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country\u2019s\nhistory of racial discrimination\u201d). Perfect compliance with the\nFifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive command is not now\u2014nor has it\never been\u2014the yardstick for determining whether Congress has the\npower to employ broad prophylactic legislation to enforce that\nAmendment. The burden remains with Congress to prove that the\nextreme circumstances warranting \u00a75\u2019s enactment persist today. A\nrecord of scattered infringement of the right to vote is not a\nconstitutionally acceptable substitute.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In 1870, the\nFifteenth Amendment was ratified in order to guarantee that no\ncitizen would be denied the right to vote based on race, color, or\nprevious condition of servitude. Congress passed \u00a75 of the VRA in\n1965 because that promise had remained unfulfilled for far too\nlong. But now\u2014more than 40 years later\u2013\u2013the violence, intimidation,\nand subterfuge that led Congress to pass \u00a75 and this Court to\nuphold it no longer remains. An acknowledgment of \u00a75\u2019s\nunconstitutionality represents a fulfillment of the Fifteenth\nAmendment\u2019s promise of full enfranchisement and honors the success\nachieved by the VRA.Footnote\n1All 17 covered jurisdictions\nthat have been awarded bailout are from Virginia, seeante, at 15\u201316, and all 17 were represented by the same\nattorney\u2014a former lawyer in the Voting Rights Section of the\nDepartment of Justice, see Hebert, An Assessment of the Bailout\nProvisions of the Voting Rights Act, in Voting Rights Act\nReauthorization of 2006, p.\u00a0257, n.\u00a01 (A. Henderson ed.\n2007). Whatever the reason for this anomaly, it only underscores\nhow little relationship there is between the existence of bailout\nand the constitutionality of \u00a75.Footnote\n2See also S.\u00a0Rep.
