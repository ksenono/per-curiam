    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 16\u20135294_________________JAMES E. McWILLIAMS, PETITIONERv.JEFFERSON S. DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS,\net\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit[June 19, 2017]Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice,\nJustice Thomas, and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.We granted review in this case to decide a\nstraightforward legal question on which the lower courts are\ndivided: whether our decision inAkev.Oklahoma,470\nU.\u00a0S. 68 (1985) , clearly established that an indigent\ndefendant whose mental health will be a significant factor at trial\nis entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert who is a\nmember of the defense team instead of a neutral expert who is\navailable to assist both the prosecution and the defense.[1]The answer to that question is plain:Akedid not clearly establish that a defendant is entitled to an expert\nwho is a member of the defense team. Indeed, \u201cAkeappears to\nhave been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this point,\nthus leaving the issue open for future consideration.\u201d W. LaFave,\nCriminal Law \u00a78.2(d), p. 449 (5th ed. 2010) (LaFave). Accordingly,\nthe proper disposition of this case is to affirm the judgment\nbelow.The Court avoids that outcome by means of a most\nunseemly maneuver. The Court declines to decide the question on\nwhich we granted review and thus leaves in place conflicting lower\ncourt decisions regarding the meaning of a 32-year-old\nprecedent.[2] That is bad\nenough. But to make matters worse, the Court achieves this\nunfortunate result by deciding a separate questionon which we\nexpressly declined review.And the Court decides that\nfact-bound question without giving Alabama a fair opportunity to\nbrief the issue.IUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), federal habeas relief cannot be\nawarded on a claim that a state court decided on the merits unless\nthe state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1). That standard, by design, is\n\u201cdifficult to meet.\u201dWhitev.Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S.\n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It requires habeas petitioners to \u201cshow that the state\ncourt\u2019s ruling on the claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. was so lacking in\njustification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded\ndisagreement.\u201dHarringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S.\n86, 103 (2011) . Put another way, \u201c[w]hen reviewing state criminal\nconvictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to\nafford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only\nwhen there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\u201dWoodsv.Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4\u20135).InAke,we held that a defendant must be\nprovided \u201caccess to a competent psychiatrist\u201d in two circumstances:\nfirst, \u201cwhen [the] defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that\nhis sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor\nat trial,\u201d and, second, at the sentencing phase of a capital trial,\n\u201cwhen the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant\u2019s\nfuture dangerousness.\u201d 470 U.\u00a0S., at 83.The question that we agreed to review concerns\nthe type of expert that must be provided. DidAkeclearly\nestablish that a defendant in the two situations just noted must be\nprovided with the services of an expert who functions solely as a\ndedicated member of the defense team as opposed to a neutral expert\nwho examines the defendant, reports his or her conclusions to the\ncourt and the parties, and is available to assist and testify for\nboth sides? DidAkespeak with such clarity that it ruled\nout \u201cany possibility for fairminded disagreement\u201d?Harrington,supra, at 103. The answer is \u201cno.\u201dAkeprovides no clear guidance one way or the other.AIt is certainly true that there is language inAkethat points toward the position that a defense-team\npsychiatrist should be provided. Explaining the need for the\nappointment of a psychiatric expert,Akenoted that a\npsychiatrist can \u201cassist in preparing the cross-examination of a\nState\u2019s psychiatric witnesses\u201d and would \u201cknow the probative\nquestions to ask of the opposing party\u2019s psychiatrists and how to\ninterpret their answers.\u201d 470 U.\u00a0S., at 82, 80. And whenAkediscussed expert assistance during capital sentencing,\nthe Court said that it is important for a defendant to \u201coffer a\nwell-informed expert\u2019s opposing view\u201d in the form of \u201cresponsive\npsychiatric testimony.\u201dId.,at 84.Akealso\nexplained that factfinding is improved when evidence is offered by\n\u201cpsychiatrists for each party.\u201dId., at 81. While it is\npossible for a neutral expert to provide these services, in our\nadversary system they are customarily performed by an expert\nworking exclusively for one of the parties.Other language inAke, however, points at\nleast as strongly in the opposite direction.Akewas clear\nthat an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to\n\u201cchoose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nreceive funds to hire his own.\u201dId., at 83. Instead, the\nCourt held only that a defendant is entitled to have \u201caccess\u201d to\n\u201cone competent psychiatrist\u201d chosen by the trial judge.Id.,\nat 83, 79.These limitations are at odds with the\ndefense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as \u201cthe norm\nin our adversarial system.\u201d Reply Brief 3. As McWilliams explains,\n\u201cother litigants of means\u201d screen experts to find one whose\ntentative views are favorable, and they often hire both consulting\nand testifying experts.Id., at 2\u20133. But theAkeCourt was clear that it was not holding \u201cthat a State must purchase\nfor the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier\ncounterpart might buy.\u201d 470 U.\u00a0S., at 77. On the contrary,Akeexpressly stated that a State need only provide for a\nsingle psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge. Thus,Akedoes not give the defense the right to interview\npotential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable\npreliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert. And if the\ncourt-appointed expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the\ndefendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness,Akerequires the defense team to live with the expert\u2019s\nunfavorable conclusions. As McWilliams concedes, when the only\nexpert available to indigent defendants is one selected by the\ntrial court, these defendants \u201cface a risk that their expert will\nultimately be unwilling or unableto offer testimony that will\nadvance their cause.\u201d Reply Brief 3.Akealso acknowledged that one of our\nprior cases,United Statesex\u00a0rel. Smithv.Baldi, 344 U.\u00a0S. 561 (1953) ,\u201csupport[ed] the\nproposition\u201d that due process is satisfied if a defendant merely\nhas access to a psychiatrist \u201cnot beholden to the prosecution.\u201d 470\nU.\u00a0S., at 85. WhileAkealso declared thatBaldidid not limit the Court \u201cin considering whether fundamental\nfairness today requires a different result,\u201d 470 U.\u00a0S., at 85,Akedid not explicitly overruleBaldi, and ultimately\nits treatment of that case was \u201cmost ambiguous,\u201d LaFave \u00a78.2, at\n450, n. 124.It is also significant that theAkeCourt\nhad no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment\nof a defense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake\nwas denied the assistance ofanypsychiatrist\u2014neutral or\notherwise\u2014for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of\nthe offense or his mental state as it related to capital\nsentencing. 470 U.\u00a0S., at 71\u201373 (state experts who examined\nAke and testified he was dangerous evaluated him only in connection\nwith his competency to stand trial). As Ake\u2019s counsel explained at\nargument, the Court could rule in his client\u2019s favor without\naccepting his client\u2019s \u201cprimary submission\u201d that due process\nrequires the appointment of a defense-team expert. Tr. of Oral Arg.\nin No. 83\u20135424 p. 21 (arguing that Ake\u2019s rights were violated even\nunderBaldi).In short,Akeis ambiguous, perhaps\n\u201cdeliberately\u201d so. LaFave \u00a78.2(d), at 449; seeibid.(\u201c[C]omments supporting a move in either direction appear\nthroughout the majority opinion in the case\u201d). If the Justices who\njoined Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion for the Court had agreed that\nadefense-team expert must be appointed, it would have been a simple\nmatter for the Court to say so expressly. Justice Marshall\ndemonstrated this a few years later when he dissented from the\ndenial of certiorari in a case that presented the very issue that\nthe Court now dodges.Granvielv.Texas, 495\nU.\u00a0S. 963 (1990) . There, Justice Marshall stated\nunambiguously that \u201cAkemandates the provision of a\npsychiatrist who will be part of the defense team and serve the\ndefendant\u2019s interests in the context of our adversarial system.\u201dIbid.If all the Justices who joined the opinion of the\nCourt inAkehad shared this view, there is no obvious\nreason for the absence of the sort of clear statement that Justice\nMarshall would later provide when he wrote only for himself. The\nopinion inAkehas all the hallmarks of a compromise.The Court\u2019s actions in the aftermath ofAkelend support to this conclusion. The Court repeatedly\ndenied certiorari in cases that would have permitted it to resolve\nthis question or others left open byAke. See,e.g.,Norrisv.Starr, 513 U.\u00a0S. 995 (1994) ;Vickersv.Arizona, 497 U.\u00a0S. 1033 (1990) ;Brownv.Dodd, 484 U.\u00a0S. 874 (1987) ;Johnsonv.Oklahoma, 484 U.\u00a0S. 878 (1987) ;Granviel,supra, at 963. And in many of these cases\n(Vickers,Dodd,Johnson, andGranviel),\nJustice Marshall dissented. The most reason-able conclusion to draw\nfrom the Court\u2019s silence is that the exact type of expert required\nbyAkehas remained \u201can open question in our jurisprudence.\u201dCareyv.Musladin, 549 U.\u00a0S. 70, 76 (2006) .BWhen the lower courts have \u201cdiverged widely\u201d\nin assessing whether our precedents dictate a legal rule, that is a\nsign that the rule is not clearly established,ibid., and\nthat is the situation here. At the time the Alabama court addressed\nMcWilliams\u2019sAkeclaim on the merits, some courts had held\nthatAkerequires the appointment of a defense-team expert.\nSee,e.g.,Smithv.McCormick, 914 F.\u00a02d\n1153, 1156\u20131160 (CA9 1990);United Statesv.Sloan,\n776 F.\u00a02d 926, 929 (CA10 1985). But others disagreed. The\nFifth Circuit had held that a defense-team expert is not required.Granvielv.Lynaugh, 881 F.\u00a02d 185, 191\u2013192\n(1989), cert. denied, 495 U.\u00a0S. 963 (1990) . And the Oklahoma\ncourtsin Ake itselfalso interpreted our holding this way.Akev.State, 778 P.\u00a02d 460, 465 (Okla. Crim.\nApp. 1989) (\u201c[D]ue process does not entitle [Ake] to a state-funded\npsychiatric expert to support his claim; rather,due process\nrequires that he have access to a compe-tent and impartial\npsychiatrist\u201d). So had at least seven other state high courts.Williev.State, 585 So.\u00a02d 660, 671 (Miss.\n1991);Statev.Hix, 38 Ohio St. 3d 129, 131\u2013132, 527\nN.\u00a0E. 2d 784, 787 (1988);Dunnv.State, 291\nArk. 131, 132\u2013134, 722 S.\u00a0W. 2d 595, 595\u2013596 (1987);Statev.Indvik, 382 N.\u00a0W. 2d 623, 625\u2013626 (N.\nD. 1986);Palmerv.State, 486 N.\u00a0E. 2d 477,\n481\u2013482 (Ind. 1985);Statev.Smith, 217 Mont. 453,\n457\u2013460, 705 P.\u00a02d 1110, 1113\u20131114 (1985);Statev.Hoopii, 68 Haw. 246, 248\u2013251, 710 P. 2d 1193, 1195\u20131196\n(1985).Other courts struggled to reach agreement on the\nquestion. Two Eleventh Circuit panels held that a neutral expert\nsuffices, seeMagwoodv.Smith, 791 F.\u00a02d 1438,\n1443 (1986) (Akesatisfied where neutral, court-appointed\nexperts examined the defendant and testified);Clisbyv.Jones, 907 F.\u00a02d 1047, 1050 (1990) (per curiam)\n(\u201cThe state provided a duly qualified psychiatrist not beholden to\nthe prosecution and, therefore, met its obligation underAke\u201d), reh\u2019g en banc, 960 F.\u00a02d 925, 928\u2013934 (1992)\n(rejectingAkeclaim on other grounds). But another Eleventh\nCircuit panel disagreed.Cowleyv.Stricklin, 929\nF.\u00a02d 640, 644 (1991) (holding that due process requires more\nthan a neutral expert). A Sixth Circuit panel held thatAkedoes not require appointment of a defense-team expert.Kordenbrockv.Scroggy, 889 F.\u00a02d 69, 75 (1989).\nAnd when the Sixth Circuit reviewed that decision en banc, its\nholding was fractured, but 7 of the 13 judges expressed the view\nthatAkerequires only a neutral, court-appointed\nexpert.[3] 919 F.\u00a02d 1091,\n1110, 1117\u20131120, 1131\u20131132 (1990).Ake\u2019s ambiguity has been noted time and\nagain by commentators. See,e.g., LaFave \u00a78.2(d), at 449\n(Akeappears to be \u201cdeliberately ambiguous\u201d); Mosteller, The\nSixth Amendment Right to Fairness: The Touchstone of Effectiveness\nand Pragmatism, 45 Tex.

Pet. for Cert. i. The first was the legal\nquestion discussed above; the second raised an issue that is tied\nto the specific facts of McWilliams\u2019s case: whether the neutral\nexpert appointed in this case failed to provide the assistance thatAkerequires because he \u201cdistributed his report to all\nparties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review\nvoluminous medical and psychological records.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.\nOur Rules and practice disfavor questions of this nature, see this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 10, and we denied review. Heeding our decision, the\nparties briefed the first question but scarcely mentioned anything\nrelated to the second.The Court, however, feels no similar obligation\nto abide by the Rules. The Court refuses to decide the legal\nquestion on which we granted review and instead decides the\nquestion on which review was denied. The Court holds that \u201cAlabama\nhere did not meet evenAke\u2019s most basic requirements.\u201dAnte, at 14. In support of this conclusion, the Court states\nthat neither Dr. Goff (the expert appointed by the trial judge) nor\nany other expert provided assistance in understanding and\nevaluating medical reports and records, preparing a legal strategy,\npresenting evidence, or preparing to cross-examine witnesses.Ibid.The Court does not question Dr. Goff\u2019s qualifications\nor his objectivity. Instead, the crux of the Court\u2019s complaint is\nthat Dr. Goff merely submitted his report and did not provide\nfurther assistance to the defense.Ibid.But as far as the\nrecord shows, Dr. Goff was never asked and never refused to provide\nassistance to McWilliams. He did not provide the assistance that\nthe Court finds essential because his report was not given to the\nparties until two days before sentencing, and arrangements were not\nmade for him to provide the assistance during that brief interlude.\nThus, the question that the Court decides is precisely the questionon which we denied review: namely, whether Dr. Goff\u2019s\nassistance was deficient because he \u201cdistributed his report to all\nparties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review\nvoluminous medical and psychological records.\u201d Pet. for Cert. iOur Rules instruct litigants that we will\nconsider only the questions on which review was granted and\n\u201csubsidiary question fairly included therein.\u201d This Court\u2019s Rule\n14.1(a);Yeev.Escondido, 503 U.\u00a0S. 519, 535\n(1992) (The Court will consider an \u201cunpresented question\u201d only in\n\u201cthe most exceptional cases\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nsee also this Court\u2019s Rule 24.1(a) (parties may not change the\nsubstance of the question presented once granted). And we have not\nhesitated to enforce these Rules when petitioners who \u201cpersuaded us\nto grant certiorari\u201d on one question instead \u201cchose to rely on a\ndifferent argument in their merits briefing.\u201dVisa, Inc.v.Osborn, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (dismissing cases as improvidently granted on this\nground).These Rules exist for good reasons. Among other\nthings, they give the parties notice of the question to be decided\nand ensure that we receive adversarial briefing, seeYee,supra, at 536, which in turns helps the Court reach sound\ndecisions. But in this case, the Court feels free to dis-regard our\nRules and long-established practice. If McWilliams, after inducing\nus to grant certiorari on the first question presented, had decided\nto ignore that question and instead brief a fact-specific\nalternative theory, we would have dismissed the case as\nimprovidently granted. We do not tolerate this sort of\nbait-and-switch tactic from litigants, and we should not engage in\nit ourselves.The Court\u2019s approach is acutely unfair to\nAlabama. The State surely believed that it did not need to brief\nthe second question presented in McWilliams\u2019s petition. The State\nvigorously opposed review of that question, calling it \u201can\ninvitation to conduct factbound error correction,\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 13, and we denied review. It will come as a nasty\nsurprise to Alabama that the Court has ruled against it on the very\nquestion we declined to review\u2014and without giving the State a fair\nchance to respond.[4]It is worth remembering that today\u2019s ruling\nrequires the Court to conclude that the state court\u2019s treatment of\nMcWilliams\u2019sAkeclaim \u201cwas so lacking in justification that\nthere was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201dHarrington, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 103. This \u201cstandard is\ndifficult to meet,\u201did., at 102, and Alabama would surely\nhave appreciated the opportunity to contest whether McWilliams has\nmet it. Denying Alabama that chance does not show \u201c[a] proper\nrespect for AEDPA\u2019s high bar for habeas relief,\u201d which counsels\nrestraint in \u201cdisturbing the State\u2019s significant interest in repose\nfor concluded litigation, denying society the right to punish some\nadmitted offenders, and intruding on state sovereignty to a degree\nmatched by few exercises of federal authority.\u201dVirginiav.LeBlanc,ante,at 5 (per curiam) (alterations\nand internal quotation marks omitted).It is debatable whether the Court has even\nanswered question two correctly (and, of course, meaningful\nbriefing by the parties would have allowed the Court to answer the\nquestion with more confidence).[5] But the fundamental point is that the Court should not\nhave addressed this question at all.IIIHaving completed an arduous detour around the\nquestion that we agreed to decide, the majority encounters an\ninconvenient roadblock: The Court of Appeals has already determined\nthat any error of the sort the majority identifies today was\nharmless. So the majority relies on the thinnest of reasons to\nrequire the Eleventh Circuit to redo its analysis. That conclusion\nis unwarranted, and nothing in the majority opinion prevents the\nCourt of Appeals from reaching the same result on remand.The majority claims that the Court of Appeals\ndid not \u201cspecifically consider whether access to the type of\nmeaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the\ndefense thatAkerequires would have mattered.\u201dAnte,\nat 15. But the Court of Appeals concluded that, even if Dr. Goff\u2019s\nperformance did not satisfyAke, the error did not have a\nsubstantial and injurious effect on the outcome of the sentencing\nproceeding.McWilliamsv.Commissioner,Ala. Dept.\nof Corrections, 634 Fed. Appx. 698, 706\u2013707 (CA11 2015) (per\ncuriam). Thus, the Court of Appeals specifically addressed the\nvery question that the majority instructs it to consider on\nremand.If the majority disagrees with the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision on that question, it should explain its reasons,\nbut the majority is unwilling to tackle that matter and instead\nrecites that \u201cwe are a court of review, not first view.\u201dAnte, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\u2019s\ninvocation of this oft-used formulation is utterly inapt because\nthe Eleventh Circuit has already reviewed the question of harmless\nerror. Moreover, unlike the question that the majority does decide,\nthe harmless-error issue was at least briefed in a meaningful way\nby the parties. Brief for Petitioner 41\u201346; Brief for Respondents\n52\u201356; Reply Brief 14\u201316.Had the Court confronted the harmless-error\nissue, it would have found it difficult to reject the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 conclusion that anyAkeerror here was harmless. In\n1984, McWilliams \u201craped, robbed, and murdered Patricia Vallery\nReynolds.\u201dMcWilliamsv.State, 640 So.\u00a02d 982,\n986 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nReynolds was a clerk at a convenience store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Ibid.McWilliams robbed the store, brutally raped Reynolds\nin a back room, then left her on the floor to die after shooting\nher six times execution style with a .38 caliber pistol.Ibid.After McWilliams was apprehended, he bragged to other\njail inmates about what he had done.Id., at 987. The jury\nneeded less than an hour of deliberation to find him guilty, and it\nrecommended the death penalty by a 10-to-2 vote the following day.Id., at 986.Agreeing with the jury\u2019s nonbinding\nrecommendation, the trial court imposed the death penalty based on\nthree aggravating circumstances. McWilliams had prior violent\nfelony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree rape.\nApp. 182a\u2013183a. He murdered Reynolds in the course of committing a\nrobbery and rape.Id., at 183a. And his crime \u201cwas\nespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d: He executed the only\npotential eyewitness to his robbery, and his conduct during and\nafter the crime showed an \u201cobvious lack of regard or compassion for\nthe life and human dignity of the victim.\u201dId.,at 184a.\nBalanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams\u2019s claim\nthat he was psychotic and suffered from organic brain\ndysfunction\u2014the mitigating evidence that Dr. Goff\u2019s report\nsupposedly would have supported. But the sentencing court concluded\nthat this evidence \u201cdid not rise to the level of a mitigating\ncircumstance,\u201d in part because of the extensive evidence that\nMcWilliams was feigning symptoms.Id.,at 188a. And in any\nevent, the sentencing court found that \u201cthe aggravating\ncircumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating\ncircumstance.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added).The majority hints that the sentencing court\u2019s\nweighing might have been different if McWilliams had been afforded\nmore time to work with Dr. Goff to prepare a mitigation\npresentation and to introduce Dr. Goff\u2019s testimony at the\nsentencing hearing. But there is little basis for this belief. The\ndefense would have faced potential rebuttal testimony from three\ndoctors who evaluated McWilliams and firmly concluded that\nMcWilliams\u2019s mental state did not reduce his responsibility for his\nactions. Certified Trial Record 1545 (Dr. Yumul) (McWilliams \u201cwas\nresponsible and free of mental illness at the time of the alleged\noffense\u201d);id., at 1546 (Dr. Nagi) (McWilliams \u201cwas not\nsuffering from a mental illness\u201d at the time of the crime and\n\u201c[t]here see[m] to be no mitigating circumstances involved in [his]\ncase\u201d);ibid.(Dr. Bryant) (finding no \u201cevidence of\npsychiatric symptoms of other illness that would provide a basis\nfor mitigating factors at the time of the alleged crime\u201d). One of\nthese psychiatrists also concluded that McWilliams was \u201cgrossly\nexaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness\u201d\nand that he \u201cobviously\u201d did so \u201cto evade criminal prosecution.\u201dIbid.(Dr. Nagi). Even Dr. Goff found it \u201cquite obvious\u201d\nthat McWilliams\u2019s \u201csymptoms of psychiatric disturbance [were] quite\nexaggerated and, perhaps, feigned.\u201dId., at 1635. In light\nof all this, the defense would have faced an uphill battle in\nconvincing the sentencing judge that, despite McWilliams\u2019s\nconsistent malingering, his mental health was so impaired that it\nconstituted a mitigating circumstance and that it outweighed the\nthree aggravators the State proved. If the sentencing judge had\nthought that there was a possibility that hearing from Dr. Goff\nwould change his evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors,\nhe could have granted a continuance and called for Dr. Goff to\nappear. But he did not do so.The majority also ignores the fact that\nMcWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of\nthe sentencing proceeding would have been different if he had been\ngiven more expert assistance. In state postconviction proceedings,\nMcWilliams argued that he was denied effective assistance of\ncounsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have\nfully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.\nMcWilliams called an expert, Dr. Woods, who offered the opinion\nthat McWilliams suffered from bipolar disorder at the time of the\ncrime and testified that McWilliams\u2019s exaggeration of symptoms was\nnot inconsistent with psychiatric problems. But Dr. Woods also\nacknowledged that McWilliams \u201ctr[ied] to malinger for purposes of\nmaking himself look worse than he is,\u201d agreed that this malingering\ncould have been done for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty,\nand declined to say that McWilliams\u2019s disorder explains why he\nraped and murdered Reynolds. Postconviction Tr. 1002\u20131005,\n1022\u20131023. Dr. Woods even endorsed Dr. Goff\u2019s conclusion that\nMcWilliams \u201cexaggerated certain aspects of his impairment.\u201dId.,at 955 (\u201cI think Dr. Goff did an excellent job of\nattempting to separate out what were in fact exaggerations and what\nwas real impairment\u201d). The State introduced a psychologist of its\nown (Dr. Kirkland) who strenuously disagreed with Dr. Woods\u2019s\ndiagnosis and concluded that nothing \u201cindicate[s] that Mr.\nMcWilliams was mentally impaired on the night of the offense.\u201dId.,at 1088. At the end of a lengthy hearing in which both\nexperts addressed the malingering issue (see,e.g.,id., at 935\u2013943, 955, 964\u2013966, 1076\u20131077), the state\npostconviction court found that \u201cMcWilliams\u2019s claims based upon the\ntestimony of Dr. Woods are without merit.\u201dId., at 1810. It\ncredited the \u201cconsensus opinion\u201d reached by the three neutral state\npsychiatrists, who observed and evaluated McWilliams for over a\nmonth before his trial and concluded that he \u201cdid not suffer from a\nmental illness.\u201dId., at 1812. It expressly found that \u201cboth\nthe credibility of Dr. Woods and the reliability of his findings\nare questionable.\u201dId., at 1814. And even if Dr. Woods\u2019s\ndiagnosis was accurate, the court stated, it \u201c[would] not find that\na failure to present\u201d evidence of this sort \u201cmade a difference in\nthe outcome.\u201dId., 1815.[6] The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,McWilliamsv.State, 897 So. 2d 437 (2004), and the\nAlabama Supreme Court denied review. I see no ground for disturbing\nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision on harmless error.[7]*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The Court\u2019s decision represents an inexcusable\ndeparture from sound practice. I would affirm the judgment below,\nand I therefore respectfully dissent.Notes1The question was worded\nas follows: \u201cWhen this Court held inAkethat an indigent\ndefendant is entitled to meaningful expert assistance for the\n\u2018evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,\u2019 did it\nclearly establish that the expert should be independent of the\nprosecution?\u201d2Defending its approach,\nthe Court says that it had no need to decide the \u201csweeping\u201d\nquestion on which review was granted \u201cwhen a narrow one will do.\u201dAnte,at 14. Narrow holdings have their place, but here: (1)\nWe denied review of the narrow question; (2) the question decided\nis not just narrow, it is the sort of factbound question as to\nwhich review is disfavored, see this Court\u2019s Rule 10; (3) the\nnarrow question is not fairly included in the question presented,\nsee this Court\u2019s Rule 14(a); (4) deciding the case on this narrow\nground leaves in place the conflict in the lower courts that\nsupported the grant of certiorari; and (5) the parties were not\ngiven notice of this possible disposition, and the Court was thus\ndeprived of the benefit of full briefing and argument on the\nissue.3The Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nexperience, standing alone, is a telling reflection ofAke\u2019s\nambiguity. Years afterKordenbrock, a Sixth Circuit panel\nheld thatAkerequires a defense expert.Powellv.Collins, 332 F.\u00a03d 376, 392 (2003). A later panel\ndisagreed.Smithv.Mitchell, 348 F.\u00a03d 177,\n207\u2013208, and n.\u00a010 (2003). A different panel concluded three\nyears later that the Circuit had \u201cextend[ed]Ake\u201d to require\na defense expert.Carterv.Mitchell, 443 F.\u00a03d\n517, 526 (2003). A later panel insisted that \u201cAkedoes not\nentitle [defendants] to .\u00a0.\u00a0. an [independent\npsychiatric] expert,\u201d but to \u201ca \u2018friend of the court\u2019 appointment.\u201dWogenstahlv.Mitchell, 668 F.\u00a03d 307, 340\n(2012). The Sixth Circuit ultimately concluded thatAkedid\nnot itself clearly compel an answer to this question for AEDPA\npurposes.Millerv.Colson, 694 F.\u00a03d 691, 698\n(2012) (\u201c[O]ur own internal conflict about the scope ofAkeevidences the reasonableness of the state court\ndecision\u201d).4The Court is incorrect in\nsuggesting that Alabama \u201cdevoted an entire section of its merits\nbrief\u201d to the question that the Court decides.Ante,at 14.\nIn the section to which the Court refers, Alabama argued that even\nif McWilliams was entitled to relief underAketo a partisan\nexpert, no relief was warranted because he \u201chad a consulting expert\nthat did not report to the State,\u201di.e.\u201ca psychologist\nemployed at the University of Alabama,\u201d and because the trial court\nordered every form of testing that the defense requested. Brief for\nRespondents 50\u201352. Exactly six sentences of the State\u2019s briefing in\nthis section,id.,at 52, touch on the services provided by\nDr. Goff and the trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance. The State\u2019s\ninclusion of this fleeting discussion cannot justify a decision\nbased on a question on which relief was denied.5The Court never even\nrecites the applicable standard: whether the Alabama courts erred\nbeyond fairminded disagreement in rejecting McWilliams\u2019s claim\nunderAkev.Oklahoma,470 U.\u00a0S. 68 (1985) .Harringtonv.Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011)\n. This bar is difficult for a habeas petitioner to hurdle, and it\nis far from clear that McWilliams has done so. The Court says that\nDr. Goff did not play the roleAkerequires of an expert\nbecause he only examined McWilliams and reported his findings to\nthe trial court.Ante,at\u00a015. Butthat is exactly\nwhat the trial court (at McWilliams\u2019s request) ordered him to\ndo. Cert. Trial Record 1615, 1616. The Court briskly concludes\nthat Dr. Goff did not assist the defense in understanding his\nreport prior to the hearing or testify for McWilliams at the\njudicial sentencing hearing.Ante,at 14\u201315. But the Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals found \u201cno indication in the record that\n[McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain\nhis findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to\ndiscuss his findings.\u201dMcWilliamsv.State, 640\nSo.\u00a02d 982, 991 (1991). And the Eleventh Circuit saw no reason\nwhy McWilliams\u2019s defense team could not have been in contact with\nDr. Goff while he was preparing the report.McWilliamsv.Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 634 Fed. Appx. 698,\n706\u2013707 (2015) (per curiam).6Dr. Goff was notably\nabsent from the postconviction proceeding. McWilliams\u2019s failure to\ncall him as a witness there creates a \u201cvoid in the record\u201d that\nprevents McWilliams from carrying his burden of showing \u201chow\nadditional time with Dr. Goff (and his report) would have benefited\nthe defense.\u201d 634 Fed. Appx., at 712 (Jordan, J., concurring). It\nalso suggests that, to McWilliams\u2019s postconviction counsel, Dr.\nGoff\u00a0\u2019s diagnosis and the opportunity to present it to the\nsentencer was not as important as McWilliams suggests.7McWilliams\u2019s entitlement\nto relief underAkeis questionable for an additional\nreason.Akeheld that the right to a psychiatric expert at\ncapital sentencing comes into play \u201cwhen the State presents\npsychiatric evidence of the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness.\u201d 470\nU.\u00a0S., at 83\u201384, 86. Here, the State did not introduce such\nevidence because future dangerousness was not an aggravator under\nAlabama law. See App. 182a\u2013184a. As lower courts have noted, we\nhave never held that a capital defendant is entitled to the\nassistance of a psychiatric expert at sentencing where future\ndangerousness is not in issue and the State does not introduce\npsychiatric evidence to prove it. See,e.g.,Revillav.Gibson, 283 F.\u00a03d 1203, 1220\u20131221 (CA10 2002)\n(\u201cAkeheld only that an indigent capital defendant must,\nupon request,\u00a0be provided an expert for the penalty phase when\nthe State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant\u2019s future\ndangerousness\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));Ramdassv.Angelone, 187 F.\u00a03d 396, 409 (CA4 1999) (\u201cAkeprovides a right to assistance of a mental health expert only if\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. , in arguing future dangerousness in the sentencing\nphase, the prosecution used expert psychiatric testimony\u201d);Goodwinv.Johnson, 132 F.\u00a03d 162, 189 (CA5\n1997), as amended Jan. 15, 1998 (\u201cAkeonly creates an\nentitlement to the assistance of a psychiatrist during sentencing\nwhen the state offers psychiatric evidence of the defendant\u2019s\nfuture dangerousness\u201d (emphasis deleted)).",
