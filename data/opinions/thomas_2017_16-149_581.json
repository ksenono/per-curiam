A statute that confers on an executive agency the\npower to enter into contracts that pre-empt state law\u2014such as the\nFederal Employee Health Benefits Act of 1959, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a78902\u2014might unlawfully delegate legislative power to the President\ninsofar as the statute fails sufficiently to constrain the\nPresident\u2019s contracting discretion. SeeDepartment of\nTransportationv.Association of American Railroads, 575\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 11\u201322); see alsoWhitmanv.American\nTrucking Assns.,Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 472 (2001) .\nRespondent, however, failed to make that argument. The Court\ntherefore appropriately leaves that issue to be decided, if at all,\non remand.",
