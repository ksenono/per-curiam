BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.,\nPETITIONERSv.AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF POLITICAL\nCONSULTANTS, INC., et al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit[July 6, 2020]Justice Kavanaugh announced the judgment of\nthe Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice and\nJustice Alito join, and in which Justice Thomas joins as to Parts I\nand II.Americans passionately disagree about many\nthings. But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls.\nThe Federal Government receives a staggering number of complaints\nabout robocalls\u20143.7 million complaints in 2019 alone. The States\nlikewise field a constant barrage of complaints.For nearly 30 years, the people\u2019s\nrepresentatives in Congress have been fighting back. As relevant\nhere, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, known as the\nTCPA, generally prohibits robocalls to cell phones and home phones.\nBut a 2015 amendment to the TCPA allows robocalls that are made to\ncollect debts owed to or guaranteed by the Federal Government,\nincluding robocalls made to collect many student loan and mortgage\ndebts.This case concerns robocalls to cell phones.\nPlaintiffs in this case are political and nonprofit organizations\nthat want to make political robocalls to cell phones. Invoking the\nFirst Amendment, they argue that the 2015 government-debt exception\nunconstitutionally favors debt-collection speech over political and\nother speech. As relief from that unconstitutional law, they urge\nus to invalidate the entire 1991 robocall restriction, rather than\nsimply invalidating the 2015 government-debt exception.Six Members of the Court today conclude that\nCongress has impermissibly favored debt-collection speech over\npolitical and other speech, in violation of the First Amendment.\nSeeinfra, at 6\u20139;post, at 1\u20132 (Sotomayor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment);post, at 1, 3 (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Applying\ntraditional severability principles, seven Members of the Court\nconclude that the entire 1991 robocall restriction should not be\ninvalidated, but rather that the 2015 government-debt exception\nmust be invalidated and severed from the remainder of the statute.\nSeeinfra, at 10\u201325;post, at 2 (Sotomayor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment);post, at 11\u201312 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting\nin part). As a result, plaintiffs still may not make political\nrobocalls to cell phones, but their speech is now treated equally\nwith debt-collection speech. The judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court\nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.IAIn 1991, Congress passed and President George H.\nW. Bush signed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The Act\nresponded to a torrent of vociferous consumer complaints about\nintrusive robocalls. A growing number of telemarketers were using\nequipment that could automatically dial a telephone number and\ndeliver an artificial or prerecorded voice message. At the time,\nmore than 300,000 solicitors called more than 18 million Americans\nevery day. TCPA, \u00a72, \u00b6\u00b63, 6, 105Stat. 2394, note following 47\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227. Consumers were \u201coutraged\u201d and considered\nrobocalls an invasion of privacy \u201cregardless of the content or the\ninitiator of the message.\u201d \u00b6\u00b66, 10.A leading Senate sponsor of the TCPA captured\nthe zeitgeist in 1991, describing robocalls as \u201cthe scourge of\nmodern civilization. They wake us up in the morning; they interrupt\nour dinner at night; they force the sick and elderly out of bed;\nthey hound us until we want to rip the telephone right out of the\nwall.\u201d 137 Cong. Rec. 30821 (1991).In enacting the TCPA, Congress found that\nbanning robocalls was \u201cthe only effective means of protecting\ntelephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.\u201d TCPA\n\u00a72, \u00b612. To that end, the TCPA imposed various restrictions on the\nuse of automated telephone equipment. \u00a73(a), 105Stat. 2395. As\nrelevant here, one restriction prohibited \u201cany call (other than a\ncall made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express\nconsent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing\nsystem or an artificial or prerecorded voice\u201d to \u201cany telephone\nnumber assigned to a paging service,cellular telephone\nservice, specialized mobile radio service, or other radio\ncommon carrier service, or any service for which the called party\nis charged for the call.\u201dId., at 2395\u20132396 (emphasis\nadded). That provision is codified in \u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of Title\n47 of the U.\u00a0S. Code.In plain English, the TCPA prohibited almost all\nrobocalls to cell phones.[1]Twenty-four years later, in 2015, Congress\npassed and President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act. In\naddition to making other unrelated changes to the U.\u00a0S. Code,\nthat Act amended the TCPA\u2019s restriction on robocalls to cell\nphones. It stated:\u201c(a) In General.\u2014Section 227(b) of the\nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. 227(b)) is\namended\u2014(1) in paragraph (1)\u2014(A) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by inserting\n\u2018, unless such call is made solely to collect a debt owed to or\nguaranteed by the United States\u2019 after \u2018charged for the\ncall.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 129Stat. 588.[2]In other words, Congress carved out a new\ngovernment-debt exception to the general robocall restriction.The TCPA imposes tough penalties for violating\nthe robocall restriction. Private parties can sue to recover up to\n$1,500 per violation or three times their actual monetary losses,\nwhich can add up quickly in a class action. \u00a7227(b)(3). States may\nbring civil actions against robocallers on behalf of their\ncitizens. \u00a7227(g)(1). And the Federal Communications Commission can\nseek forfeiture penalties for willful or repeated violations of the\nstatute. \u00a7503(b).BPlaintiffs in this case are the American\nAssociation of Political Consultants and three other organizations\nthat participate in the political system. Plaintiffs and their\nmembers make calls to citizens to discuss candidates and issues,\nsolicit donations, conduct polls, and get out the vote. Plaintiffs\nbelieve that their political outreach would be more effective and\nefficient if they could make robocalls to cell phones.[3] But because plaintiffs are not in\nthe business of collecting government debt, \u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii)\nprohibits them from making those robocalls.Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action\nagainst the U.\u00a0S. Attorney General and the FCC, claiming that\n\u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii) violated the First Amendment. The U.\u00a0S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina\ndetermined that the robocall restriction with the government-debt\nexception was a content-based speech regulation, thereby triggering\nstrict scrutiny. But the court concluded that the law survived\nstrict scrutiny, even with the content-based exception, because of\nthe Government\u2019s compelling interest in collecting debt.The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit vacated the judgment.American Assn. of Political\nConsultants, Inc.v.FCC, 923 F.3d 159 (2019). The Court\nof Appeals agreed with the District Court that the robocall\nrestriction with the government-debt exception was a content-based\nspeech restriction. But the court held that the law could not\nwithstand strict scrutiny and was therefore unconstitutional. The\nCourt of Appeals then applied traditional severability principles\nand concluded that the government-debt exception was severable from\nthe underlying robocall restriction. The Court of Appeals therefore\ninvalidated the government-debt exception and severed it from the\nrobocall restriction.The Government petitioned for a writ of\ncertiorari because the Court of Appeals invalidated part of a\nfederal statute\u2014namely, the government-debt exception. Plaintiffs\nsupported the petition, arguing from the other direction that the\nCourt of Appeals did not go far enough in providing relief and\nshould have invalidated the entire 1991 robocall restriction rather\nthan simply invalidating the 2015 government-debt exception. We\ngranted certiorari. 589 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2020).IIRatified in 1791, the First Amendment provides\nthat Congress shall make no law \u201cabridging the freedom of speech.\u201d\nAbove \u201call else, the First Amendment means that government\u201d\ngenerally \u201chas no power to restrict expression because of its\nmessage, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u201dPolice\nDept. of Chicagov.Mosley,408 U.S.\n92, 95 (1972).The Court\u2019s precedents allow the government to\n\u201cconstitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner\nregulations\u201d on speech, but the precedents restrict the government\nfrom discriminating \u201cin the regulation of expression on the basis\nof the content of that expression.\u201dHudgensv.NLRB,424 U.S.\n507, 520 (1976). Content-based laws are subject to strict\nscrutiny. SeeReedv.Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155,\n163\u2013164 (2015). By contrast, content-neutral laws are subject to a\nlower level of scrutiny.Id., at 166.Section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) generally bars\nrobocalls to cell phones. Since the 2015 amendment, the law has\nexempted robocalls to collect government debt. The initial First\nAmendment question is whether the robocall restriction, with the\ngovernment-debt exception, is content-based. The answer is yes.As relevant here, a law is content-based if \u201ca\nregulation of speech \u2018on its face\u2019 draws distinctions based on the\nmessage a speaker conveys.\u201dReed,576 U.\u00a0S., at 163.\nThat description applies to a law that \u201csingles out specific\nsubject matter for differential treatment.\u201dId., at 169. For\nexample, \u201ca law banning the use of sound trucks for political\nspeech\u2014and only political speech\u2014would be a content-based\nregulation, even if it imposed no limits on the political\nviewpoints that could be expressed.\u201dIbid.; see,e.g.,Simon & Schuster, Inc.v.Members of N.\nY. State Crime Victims Bd.,502 U.S.\n105, 116 (1991);Arkansas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc.v.Ragland,481 U.S.\n221, 229\u2013230 (1987);Widmarv.Vincent,454 U.S.\n263, 265, 276\u2013277 (1981);Careyv.Brown,447 U.S.\n455, 459\u2013463 (1980);Erznoznikv.Jacksonville,422 U.S.\n205, 211\u2013212 (1975);Mosley, 408 U.\u00a0S., at\n95\u201396.Under \u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii), the legality of a\nrobocall turns on whether it is \u201cmade solely to collect a debt owed\nto or guaranteed by the United States.\u201d A robocall that says,\n\u201cPlease pay your government debt\u201d is legal. A robocall that says,\n\u201cPlease donate to our political campaign\u201d is illegal. That is about\nas content-based as it gets. Because the law favors speech made for\ncollecting government debt over political and other speech, the law\nis a content-based restriction on speech.The Government advances three main arguments for\ndeeming the statute content-neutral, but none is persuasive.First, the Government suggests that\n\u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii) draws distinctions based on speakers (authorized\ndebt collectors), not based on content. But that is not the law in\nfront of us. This statute singles out calls \u201cmade solely to collect\na debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States,\u201d not all calls\nfrom authorized debt collectors.In any event, \u201cthe fact that a distinction is\nspeaker based\u201d does not \u201cautomatically render the distinction\ncontent neutral.\u201dReed, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 170;Sorrellv.IMS Health Inc.,564\nU.S. 552, 563\u2013564 (2011). Indeed, the Court has held that\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018\u00a0laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict\nscrutiny when the legislature\u2019s speaker preference reflects a\ncontent preference.\u2019\u00a0\u201dReed, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 170\n(quotingTurner Broadcasting System, Inc.v.FCC,512 U.S.\n622, 658 (1994)).Second, the Government argues that the\nlegality of a robocall under the statute depends simply on whether\nthe caller is engaged in a particular economic activity, not on the\ncontent of speech. We disagree. The law here focuses on whether the\ncaller isspeakingabout a particular topic. InSorrell, this Court held that a law singling out\npharmaceutical marketing for unfavorable treatment was\ncontent-based. 564 U.\u00a0S., at 563\u2013564. So too here.Third, according to the Government, if\nthis statute is content-based because it singles out\ndebt-collection speech, then so are statutes thatregulatedebt collection, like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. See\n15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692et seq.[4] That slippery-slope argument is unpersuasive in this\ncase. As we explained inSorrell, \u201cthe First Amendment does\nnot prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from\nimposing incidental burdens on speech.\u201d 564 U.\u00a0S., at 567. The\nlaw here, like the Vermont law inSorrell, \u201cdoes not simply\nhave an effect on speech, but is directed at certain content and is\naimed at particular speakers.\u201dIbid.The Government\u2019s\nconcern is understandable, but the courts have generally been able\nto distinguish impermissible content-based speech restrictions from\ntraditional or ordinary economic regulation of commercial activity\nthat imposes incidental burdens on speech. The issue before us\nconcerns only robocalls to cell phones. Our decision today on that\nissue fits comfortably within existing First Amendment precedent.\nOur decision is not intended to expand existing First Amendment\ndoctrine or to otherwise affect traditional or ordinary economic\nregulation of commercial activity.In short, the robocall restriction with the\ngovernment-debt exception is content-based. Under the Court\u2019s\nprecedents, a \u201claw that is content based\u201d is \u201csubject to strict\nscrutiny.\u201dReed, 576 U.\u00a0S., at 165. The Government\nconcedes that it cannot satisfy strict scrutiny to justify the\ngovernment-debt exception. We agree. The Government\u2019s stated\njustification for the government-debt exception is collecting\ngovernment debt. Although collecting government debt is no doubt a\nworthy goal, the Government concedes that it has not sufficiently\njustified the differentiation between government-debt collection\nspeech and other important categories of robocall speech, such as\npolitical speech, charitable fundraising, issue advocacy,\ncommercial advertising, and the like.[5]IIIHaving concluded that the 2015 government-debt\nexception created an unconstitutional exception to the 1991\nrobocall restriction, we must decide whether to invalidate the\nentire 1991 robocall restriction, or instead to invalidate and\nsever the 2015 government-debt exception. Before we apply ordinary\nseverability principles, we must address plaintiffs\u2019 broader\ninitial argument for why the entire 1991 robocall restriction is\nunconstitutional.APlaintiffs correctly point out that the\nGovernment\u2019s asserted interest for the 1991 robocall restriction is\nconsumer privacy. But according to plaintiffs, Congress\u2019s\nwillingness to enact the government-debt exception in 2015 betrays\na newfound lack of genuine congressional concern for consumer\nprivacy. As plaintiffs phrase it, the 2015 exception \u201cundermines\nthe credibility\u201d of the Government\u2019s interest in consumer privacy.\nTr. of Oral Arg. 38. Plaintiffs further contend that if Congress no\nlonger has a genuine interest in consumer privacy, then the\nunderlying 1991 robocall restriction is no longer justified\n(presumably under any level of heightened scrutiny) and is\ntherefore now unconstitutional.Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is not without force, but\nwe ultimately disagree with it. It is true that the Court has\nrecognized that exceptions to a speech restriction \u201cmay diminish\nthe credibility of the government\u2019s rationale for restricting\nspeech in the first place.\u201dCity of Laduev.Gilleo,512 U.S.\n43, 52 (1994). But here, Congress\u2019s addition of the\ngovernment-debt exception in 2015 does not cause us to doubt the\ncredibility of Congress\u2019s continuing interest in protecting\nconsumer privacy.After all, the government-debt exception is only\na slice of the overall robocall landscape. This is not a case where\na restriction on speech is littered with exceptions that\nsubstantially negate the restriction. On the contrary, even after\n2015, Congress has retained a very broad restriction on robocalls.\nThe pre-1991 statistics on robocalls show that a variety of\norganizations collectively made a huge number of robocalls. And\nthere is no reason to think that the incentives for those\norganizations\u2014and many others\u2014to make robocalls has diminished in\nany way since 1991. The continuing robocall restriction proscribestens of millionsof would-be robocalls that would otherwise\noccurevery day. Congress\u2019s continuing broad prohibition of\nrobocalls amply demonstrates Congress\u2019s continuing interest in\nconsumer privacy.The simple reality, as we assess the legislative\ndevelopments, is that Congress has competing interests. Congress\u2019s\ngrowing interest (as reflected in the 2015 amendment) in collecting\ngovernment debt does not mean that Congress suddenly lacks a\ngenuine interest in restricting robocalls. Plaintiffs seem to argue\nthat Congress must be interested either in debt collection or in\nconsumer privacy. But that is a false dichotomy, as we see it. As\nis not infrequently the case with either/or questions, the answer\nto this either/or question is \u201cboth.\u201d Congress is interested both\nin collecting government debt and in protecting consumer\nprivacy.Therefore, we disagree with plaintiffs\u2019 broader\ninitial argument for holding the entire 1991 robocall restriction\nunconstitutional.BPlaintiffs next focus on ordinary severability\nprinciples. Applying those principles, the question before the\nCourt is whether (i) to invalidate the entire 1991 robocall\nrestriction, as plaintiffs want, or (ii) to invalidate just the\n2015 government-debt exception and sever it from the remainder of\nthe statute, as the Government wants.We agree with the Government that we must\ninvalidate the 2015 government-debt exception and sever that\nexception from the remainder of the statute. To explain why, we\nbegin with general severability principles and then apply those\nprinciples to this case.1When enacting a law, Congress sometimes\nexpressly addresses severability. For example, Congress may include\naseverabilityclause in the law, making clear that the\nunconstitutionality of one provision does not affect the rest of\nthe law. See,e.g., 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75302; 15\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778gg; 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608.\nAlternatively, Congress may include anonseverabilityclause, making clear that the unconstitutionality of one provision\nmeans the invalidity of some or all of the remainder of the law, to\nthe extent specified in the text of the nonseverability clause.\nSee,e.g., 4\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7125; note following 42\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300aa\u20131; 94Stat. 1797.When Congress includes an express severability\nor nonseverability clause in the relevant statute, the judicial\ninquiry is straightforward. At least absent extraordinary\ncircumstances, the Court should adhere to the text of the\nseverability or nonseverability clause. That is because a\nseverability or nonseverability clause leaves no doubt about what\nthe enacting Congress wanted if one provision of the law were later\ndeclared unconstitutional. A severability clause indicates \u201cthat\nCongress did not intend the validity of the statute in question to\ndepend on the validity of the constitutionally offensive\nprovision.\u201dAlaska Airlines, Inc.v.Brock,480 U.S.\n678, 686 (1987). And a nonseverability clause does the\nopposite.On occasion, a party will nonetheless ask the\nCourt to override the text of a severability or nonseverability\nclause on the ground that the text does not reflect Congress\u2019s\n\u201cactual intent\u201d as to severability. That kind of argument may have\ncarried some force back when courts paid less attention to\nstatutory text as the definitive expression of Congress\u2019s will. But\ncourts today zero in on the precise statutory text and, as a\nresult, courts hew closely to the text of severability or\nnonseverability clauses. SeeSeila Law LLCv.Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau,ante, at 33 (plurality\nopinion); cf.Milnerv.Department of Navy,562 U.S.\n562, 569\u2013573 (2011).[6]Of course, when enacting a law, Congress often\ndoes not include either a severability clause or a nonseverability\nclause.In those cases, it is sometimes said that courts\napplying severability doctrine should search for other indicia of\ncongressional intent. For example, some of the Court\u2019s cases\ndeclare that courts should sever the offending provision unless\n\u201cthe statute created in its absence is legislation that Congress\nwould not have enacted.\u201dAlaska Airlines, 480 U.\u00a0S., at\n685. But experience shows that this formulation often leads to an\nanalytical dead end. That is because courts are not well equipped\nto imaginatively reconstruct a prior Congress\u2019s hypothetical\nintent. In other words, absent a severability or nonseverability\nclause, a court often cannot really know what the two Houses of\nCongress and the President from the time of original enactment of a\nlaw would have wanted if one provision of a law were later declared\nunconstitutional.The Court\u2019s cases have instead developed a\nstrong presumption of severability. The Court presumes that an\nunconstitutional provision in a law is severable from the remainder\nof the law or statute. For example, inFree Enterprise Fundv.Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., the Court set\nforth the \u201cnormal rule\u201d: \u201cGenerally speaking, when confronting a\nconstitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to\nthe problem, severing any problematic portions while leaving the\nremainder intact.\u201d561 U.S.\n477, 508 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoSeila Law,ante, at 32 (same). InReganv.Time, Inc., the plurality opinion likewise described a\n\u201cpresumption\u201d in \u201cfavor of severability\u201d and stated that the Court\nshould \u201crefrain from invalidating more of the statute than is\nnecessary.\u201d468 U.S.\n641, 652\u2013653 (1984).The Court\u2019s power and preference to partially\ninvalidate a statute in that fashion has been firmly established\nsinceMarburyv.Madison. There, the Court\ninvalidated part of \u00a713 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. 1 Cranch 137,\n179\u2013180 (1803). The Judiciary Act did not contain a severability\nclause. But the Court did not proceed to invalidate the entire\nJudiciary Act. As Chief Justice Marshall later explained, if any\npart of an Act is \u201cunconstitutional, the provisions of that part\nmay be disregarded while full effect will be given to such as are\nnot repugnant to the constitution of the United States.\u201dBank of\nHamiltonv.Lessee of Dudley, 2 Pet. 492, 526 (1829);\nsee alsoDorchyv.Kansas,264\nU.S. 286, 289\u2013290 (1924) (\u201cA statute bad in part is not\nnecessarily void in its entirety. Provisions within the legislative\npower may stand if separable from the bad\u201d);Loebv.Columbia Township Trustees,179 U.S.\n472, 490 (1900) (\u201cone section of a statute may be repugnant to\nthe Constitution without rendering the whole act void\u201d).FromMarburyv.Madisonto the\npresent, apart from some isolated detours mostly in the late 1800s\nand early 1900s, the Court\u2019s remedial preference after finding a\nprovision of a federal law unconstitutional has been to salvage\nrather than destroy the rest of the law passed by Congress and\nsigned by the President. The Court\u2019s precedents reflect a decisive\npreference for surgical severance rather than wholesale\ndestruction, even in the absence of a severability clause.The Court\u2019s presumption of severability supplies\na workable solution\u2014one that allows courts to avoid judicial\npolicymaking orde\u00a0factojudicial legislation in\ndetermining just how much of the remainder of a statute should be\ninvalidated.[7] The presumption\nalso reflects the confined role of the Judiciary in our system of\nseparated powers\u2014stated otherwise, the presumption manifests the\nJudiciary\u2019s respect for Congress\u2019s legislative role by keeping\ncourts from unnecessarily disturbing a law apart from invalidating\nthe provision that is unconstitutional. Furthermore, the\npresumption recognizes that plaintiffs who successfully challenge\none provision of a law may lack standing to challengeotherprovisions of that law. SeeMurphyv.National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn., 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 5\u20136).Those and other considerations, taken together,\nhave steered the Court to a presumption of severability. Applying\nthe presumption, the Court invalidates and severs unconstitutional\nprovisions from the remainder of the law rather than razing whole\nstatutes or Acts of Congress. Put in common parlance, the tail (one\nunconstitutional provision) does not wag the dog (the rest of the\ncodified statute or the Act as passed by Congress). Constitutional\nlitigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where\nlitigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to\ntake down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute. If the rule\nwere otherwise, the entire Judiciary Act of 1789 would be invalid\nas a consequence ofMarburyv.Madison.[8]Before severing a provision and leaving the\nremainder of a law intact, the Court must determine that the\nremainder of the statute is \u201ccapable of functioning independently\u201d\nand thus would be \u201cfully operative\u201d as a law.Seila Law,ante, at 33; seeMurphy, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 25\u201330). But it is fairly unusual for the remainder of\na law not to be operative.[9]2We next apply those general severability\nprinciples to this case.Recall how this statute came together. Passed by\nCongress and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1934, the\nCommunications Act is codified in Title 47 of the U.\u00a0S. Code.\nThe TCPA of 1991 amended the Communications Act by adding the\nrobocall restriction, which is codified at \u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of\nTitle 47. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 then amended the\nCommunications Act by adding the government-debt exception, which\nis codified along with the robocall restriction at\n\u00a7227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of Title 47.Since 1934, the Communications Act has contained\nan express severability clause: \u201cIf any provision ofthis\nchapteror the application thereof to any person or\ncircumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the\napplication of such provision to other persons or circumstances\nshall not be affected thereby.\u201d 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608\n(emphasis added). The \u201cchapter\u201d referred to in the severability\nclause is Chapter 5 of Title 47. And Chapter 5 in turn encompasses\n\u00a7151 to \u00a7700 of Title 47, and therefore covers \u00a7227 of Title 47,\nthe provision with the robocall restriction and the government-debt\nexception.[10]Enacted in 2015, the government-debt exception\nadded an unconstitutional discriminatory exception to the robocall\nrestriction. The text of the severability clause squarely covers\nthe unconstitutional government-debt exception and requires that we\nsever it.To get around the text of the severability\nclause, plaintiffs point out that the Communications Act\u2019s\nseverability clause was enacted in 1934, long before the TCPA\u2019s\n1991 robocall restriction and the 2015 government-debt exception.\nBut a severability clause must be interpreted according to its\nterms, regardless of when Congress enacted it. See n.\u00a06,supra.Even if the severability clause did not apply to\nthe government-debt provision at issue in this case (or even if\nthere were no severability clause in the Communications Act), we\nwould apply the presumption of severability as described and\napplied in cases such asFree Enterprise Fund. And under\nthat presumption, we likewise would sever the 2015 government-debt\nexception, the constitutionally offending provision.With the government-debt exception severed, the\nremainder of the law is capable of functioning independently and\nthus would be fully operative as a law. Indeed, the remainder of\nthe robocall restriction did function independently and fully\noperate as a law for 20-plus years before the government-debt\nexception was added in 2015.The Court\u2019s precedents further support severing\nthe 2015 government-debt exception. The Court has long applied\nseverability principles in cases like this one, where Congress\nadded an unconstitutional amendment to a prior law. In those cases,\nthe Court has treated the original, pre-amendment statute as the\n\u201cvalid expression of the legislative intent.\u201dFrostv.Corporation Comm\u2019n of Okla.,278 U.S.\n515, 526\u2013527 (1929). The Court has severed the \u201cexception\nintroduced by amendment,\u201d so that \u201cthe original law stands without\nthe amendatory exception.\u201dTruaxv.Corrigan,257 U.S.\n312, 342 (1921).For example, inEberlev.Michigan, the Court held that \u201cdiscriminatory wine-and-cider\namendments\u201d added in 1899 and 1903 were severable from the\nunderlying 1889 state law generally prohibiting the manufacture of\nalcohol.232 U.S.\n700, 704\u2013705 (1914). InTruax, the Court ruled that a\n1913 amendment prohibiting Arizona courts from issuing injunctions\nin labor disputes was invalid and severable from the underlying\n1901 law authorizing Arizona courts to issue injunctions generally.\n257 U.\u00a0S., at 341\u2013342. InFrost, the Court concluded\nthat a 1925 amendment exempting certain corporations from making a\nshowing of \u201cpublic necessity\u201d in order to obtain a cotton gin\nlicense was invalid and severable from the 1915 law that required\nthat showing. 278 U.\u00a0S., at 525\u2013528. EchoingMarbury,\nthe Court inFrostexplained that an unconstitutional\nstatutory amendment \u201cis a nullity\u201d and \u201cvoid\u201d when enacted, and for\nthat reason has no effect on the original statute. 278 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 526\u2013527 (internal quotation marks omitted).[11]Similarly, in 1932, Congress enacted the Federal\nKidnaping Act, and then in 1934, added a death penalty provision to\nthe Act. The death penalty provision was later declared\nunconstitutional by this Court. In considering severability, the\nCourt stated that the \u201claw as originally enacted in 1932 contained\nno capital punishment provision.\u201dUnited Statesv.Jackson,390 U.S.\n570, 586 (1968). And when Congress amended the Act in 1934 to\nadd the death penalty, \u201cthe statute was left substantially\nunchanged in every other respect.\u201dId., at 587\u2013588. The\nCourt found it \u201cdifficult to imagine a more compelling case for\nseverability.\u201dId., at 589. So too here.In sum, the text of the Communications Act\u2019s\nseverability clause requires that the Court sever the 2015\ngovernment-debt exception from the remainder of the statute. And\neven if the text of the severability clause did not apply here, the\npresumption of severability would require that the Court sever the\n2015 government-debt exception from the remainder of the\nstatute.3One final severability wrinkle remains. This is\nan equal-treatment case, and equal-treatment cases can sometimes\npose complicated severability questions.The \u201c First Amendment is a kind of Equal\nProtection Clause for ideas.\u201dWilliams-Yuleev.Florida\nBar, 575 U.S. 433, 470 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). And\nCongress violated that First Amendment equal-treatment principle in\nthis case by favoring debt-collection robocalls and discriminating\nagainst political and other robocalls.When the constitutional violation is unequal\ntreatment, as it is here, a court theoretically can cure that\nunequal treatment either by extending the benefits or burdens to\nthe exempted class, or by nullifying the benefits or burdens for\nall. See,e.g.,Hecklerv.Mathews,465 U.S.\n728, 740 (1984). Here, for example, the Government would prefer\nto cure the unequal treatment by extending the robocall restriction\nand thereby proscribing nearly all robocalls to cell phones. By\ncontrast, plaintiffs want to cure the unequal treatment by\nnullifying the robocall restriction and thereby allowing all\nrobocalls to cell phones.When, as here, the Court confronts an\nequal-treatment constitutional violation, the Court generally\napplies the same commonsense severability principles described\nabove. If the statute contains a severability clause, the Court\ntypically severs the discriminatory exception or classification,\nand thereby extends the relevant statutory benefits or burdens to\nthose previously exempted, rather than nullifying the benefits or\nburdens for all. In light of the presumption of severability, the\nCourt generally does the same even in the absence of a severability\nclause. The Court\u2019s precedents reflect that preference for\nextension rather than nullification. See,e.g.,Sessionsv.Morales-Santana, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\n(2017) (slip op., at 25);Califanov.Westcott,443 U.S.\n76, 89\u201391 (1979);Califanov.Goldfarb,430 U.S.\n199, 202\u2013204, 213\u2013217 (1977) (plurality opinion);Jimenezv.Weinberger,417 U.S.\n628, 637\u2013638 (1974);Department of Agriculturev.Moreno,413 U.S.\n528, 529, 537\u2013538 (1973);Frontierov.Richardson,411 U.S.\n677, 678\u2013679, 690\u2013691 (1973) (plurality opinion);Welshv.United States,398 U.S.\n333, 361\u2013367 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result).To be sure, some equal-treatment cases can raise\ncomplex questions about whether it is appropriate to extend\nbenefits or burdens, rather than nullifying the benefits or\nburdens. See,e.g.,Morales-Santana, 582 U.\u00a0S.\n___. For example, there can be due process, fair notice, or other\nindependent constitutional barriers to extension of benefits or\nburdens. Cf.Millerv.Albright,523 U.S.\n420, 458\u2013459 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see\ngenerally Ginsburg, Some Thoughts on Judicial Authority to Repair\nUnconstitutional Legislation, 28 Clev. St. L. Rev. 301 (1979).\nThere also can be knotty questions about what is the exception and\nwhat is the rule. But here, we need not tackle all of the possible\nhypothetical applications of severability doctrine in\nequal-treatment cases. The government-debt exception is a\nrelatively narrow exception to the broad robocall restriction, and\nsevering the government-debt exception does not raise any other\nconstitutional problems.Plaintiffs insist, however, that aFirst\nAmendmentequal-treatment case is different. According to\nplaintiffs, a court should not cure \u201ca First Amendment violation by\noutlawing more speech.\u201d Brief for Respondents 34. The implicit\npremise of that argument is that extending the robocall restriction\nto debt-collection robocalls would be unconstitutional. But that is\nwrong. A generally applicable robocall restriction would be\npermissible under the First Amendment. Extending the robocall\nrestriction to those robocalls raises no First Amendment problem.\nSo the First Amendment does not tell us which way to cure the\nunequal treatment in this case. Therefore, we apply traditional\nseverability principles. And as we have explained, severing the\n2015 government-debt exception cures the unequal treatment and\nconstitutes the proper result under the Court\u2019s traditional\nseverability principles. In short, the correct result in this case\nis to sever the 2015 government-debt exception and leave in place\nthe longstanding robocall restriction.[12]4Justice Gorsuch\u2019s well-stated separate opinion\nmakes a number of important points that warrant this respectful\nresponse.Justice Gorsuch suggests that our decision\nprovides \u201cno relief\u201d to plaintiffs.Post, at 6. We disagree.\nPlaintiffs want to be able to make political robocalls to cell\nphones, and they have not receivedthatrelief. But the\nFirst Amendment complaint at the heart of their suit was unequal\ntreatment. Invalidating and severing the government-debt exception\nfully addresses that First Amendment injury.[13] Justice Gorsuch further suggests that\nplaintiffs may lack standing to challenge the government-debt\nexception, because that exception merely favors others. Seeibid. But the Court has squarely held that a plaintiff who\nsuffers unequal treatment has standing to challenge a\ndiscriminatory exception that favors others. SeeHecklerv.Mathews, 465 U. S., at 737\u2013740 (a plaintiff who suffers\nunequal treatment has standing to seek \u201cwithdrawal of benefits from\nthe favored class\u201d); see alsoNortheastern Fla. Chapter,\nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Americav.Jacksonville,508 U.S.\n656, 666 (1993) (\u201cThe \u2018injury in fact\u2019 in an equal protection\ncase of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting\nfrom the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to\nobtain the benefit\u201d).Justice Gorsuch also objects that our decision\ntoday \u201charms strangers to this suit\u201d by eliminating favorable\ntreatment for debt collectors.Post, at 6. But that is\nnecessarily true in many cases where a court cures unequal\ntreatment by, for example, extending a burden or nullifying a\nbenefit. See,e.g.,Morales-Santana, 582 U.\nS., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (curing unequal treatment of children\nborn to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by extending a burden to\nchildren of unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers);Orrv.Orr,374 So. 2d 895, 896\u2013897 (Ala. Civ. App. 1979) (extending\nalimony obligations to women after a male plaintiff successfully\nchallenged Alabama\u2019s discriminatory alimony statute in this\nCourt).Moreover, Justice Gorsuch\u2019s approach to this\ncase would not solve the problem of harming strangers to this suit;\nit would just create a different and much bigger problem. His\nproposed remedy of injunctive relief, plusstare decisis,\nwould in effect allow all robocalls to cell phones\u2014notwithstanding\nCongress\u2019s decisive choice to prohibit most robocalls to cell\nphones. That is not a judicially modest approach but is more of a\nwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. That approach would disrespect the\ndemocratic process, through which the people\u2019s representatives have\nmade crystal clear that robocalls must be restricted. Justice\nGorsuch\u2019s remedy would end up harming a different and far larger\nset of strangers to this suit\u2014the tens of millions of consumers who\nwould be bombarded every day with nonstop robocalls notwithstanding\nCongress\u2019s clear prohibition of those robocalls.Justice Gorsuch suggests more broadly that\nseverability doctrine may need to be reconsidered. But when and\nhow? As the saying goes, John Marshall is not walking through that\ndoor. And this Court, in this and other recent decisions, has\nclarified and refined severability doctrine by emphasizing firm\nadherence to the text of severability clauses, and underscoring the\nstrong presumption of severability. The doctrine as so refined is\nconstitutionally well-rooted, see,e.g.,Marburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.), and can be\npredictably applied. True, there is no magic solution to\nseverability that solves every conundrum, especially in\nequal-treatment cases, but the Court\u2019s current approach as\nreflected in recent cases such asFree Enterprise FundandSeila Lawis constitutional, stable, predictable, and\ncommonsensical.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*In 1991, Congress enacted a general\nrestriction on robocalls to cell phones. In 2015, Congress carved\nout an exception that allowed robocalls made to collect government\ndebt. In doing so, Congress favored debt-collection speech over\nplaintiffs\u2019 political speech. We hold that the 2015 government-debt\nexception added an unconstitutional exception to the law. We cure\nthat constitutional violation by invalidating the 2015\ngovernment-debt exception and severing it from the remainder of the\nstatute. The judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit is affirmed.It is so ordered.Notes1The robocall restriction,\nas implemented by the Federal Communications Commission, bars both\nautomated voice calls and automated text messages. SeeIn\u00a0re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, 14115\n(2003). The robocall restriction applies to \u201cpersons,\u201d which does\nnot include the Government itself. See 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7153(39). Congress has also authorized the FCC to promulgate\nregulatory exceptions to the robocall restriction. See\n\u00a7227(b)(2)(C). The FCC has authorized various exceptions over the\nyears, such as exceptions for package-delivery notifications and\ncertain healthcare-related calls. In this case, plaintiffs do not\nseparately challenge the validity of the FCC\u2019s regulatory\nexceptions.2After the 2015 amendment,\n\u00a7227(b)(1) now provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person\nwithin the United States, or any person outside the United States\nif the recipient is within the United States\u2014 (A) to make any call\n(other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the\nprior express consent of the called party) using any automatic\ntelephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice\u2014\n.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003. (iii) to any telephone number assigned to\na paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile\nradio service, or other radio common carrier service, or any\nservice for which the called party is charged for the call,unless such call is made solely to collect a debt owed to or\nguaranteed by the United States.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.)3Plaintiffs have not\nchallenged the TCPA\u2019s separate restriction on robocalls to home\nphones. See 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(B).4This opinion uses the\nterm \u201cdebt-collection speech\u201d and \u201cdebt-collection robocalls\u201d as\nshorthand forgovernment-debt collection speech and\nrobocalls.5In his scholarly\nseparate opinion, Justice Breyer explains how he would apply\nfreedom of speech principles. But the Court\u2019s longstanding\nprecedents, which we carefully follow here, have not adopted that\napproach. In essence, therefore, Justice Breyer argues for\noverruling several of the Court\u2019s First Amendment cases, including\nthe recent 2015 decision inReedv.Town of Gilbert,\n576 U.S. 155 (2015). Before overruling precedent, the Court usually\nrequires that a party ask for overruling, or at least obtains\nbriefing on the overruling question, and then the Court carefully\nevaluates the traditionalstare decisisfactors. Here, no\nparty has asked for overruling, and Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion does\nnot analyze the usualstare decisisfactors. Justice\nBreyer\u2019s opinion therefore discounts both the Court\u2019s precedent and\nthe Court\u2019s precedent on precedent.6When Congress enacts a\nlaw with a severability clause and later adds new provisions to\nthat statute, the severability clause applies to those new\nprovisions to the extent dictated by the text of the severability\nclause. Likewise, when Congress hasnotincluded a\nseverability clause in initial legislation, Congress can\nsubsequently enact a severability clause that applies to the\nexisting statute to the extent dictated by the text of the\nlater-added severability clause. In both scenarios, the text of the\nseverability clause remains central to the severability\ninquiry.7If courts had broad\nlicense to invalidate more than just the offending provision, a\nreviewing court would have to consider what other provisions to\ninvalidate: the whole section, the chapter, the statute, the public\nlaw, or something else altogether. Courts would be largely at sea\nin making that determination, and usually could not do it in a\nprincipled way. Here, for example, would a court invalidate all or\npart of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 rather than all or part\nof the 1991 TCPA? After all, that 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act, not\nthe 1991 TCPA, added the constitutionally problematic\ngovernment-debt exception. That is the kind of free-wheeling policy\nquestion that the Court\u2019s presumption of severability\navoids.8The term \u201cinvalidate\u201d is\na common judicial shorthand when the Court holds that a particular\nprovision is unlawful and therefore may not be enforced against a\nplaintiff. To be clear, however, when it \u201cinvalidates\u201d a law as\nunconstitutional, the Court of course does not formally repeal the\nlaw from the U.\u00a0S. Code or the Statutes at Large. Instead, in\nChief Justice Marshall\u2019s words, the Court recognizes that the\nConstitution is a \u201csuperior, paramount law,\u201d and that \u201ca\nlegislative act contrary to the constitution is not law\u201d at all.Marburyv.Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). The\nCourt\u2019s authority on this front \u201camounts to little more than the\nnegative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment.\u201dMassachusettsv.Mellon,262\nU.S. 447, 488 (1923). Justice Thomas\u2019s thoughtful approach to\nseverability as outlined inMurphyv.National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn., 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op.,\nat 2\u20136), andSeila Law LLCv.Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau,ante, at 14\u201324, (joined by Justice\nGorsuch in the latter) would simply enjoin enforcement of a law as\napplied to the particular plaintiffs in a case. Under either the\nCourt\u2019s approach or Justice Thomas\u2019s approach, an offending\nprovision formally remains on the statute books (at least unless\nCongress also formally repeals it). Under either approach, the\nformal remedy afforded to the plaintiff is an injunction,\ndeclaration, or damages. One difference between the two approaches\nis this: Under the Court\u2019s approach, a provision is declared\ninvalid and cannot be lawfully enforced against others. Under\nJustice Thomas\u2019s approach, the Court\u2019s ruling that a provision\ncannot be enforced against the plaintiff, plus executive respect in\nits enforcement policies for controlling decisional law, plus\nvertical and horizontalstare decisisin the courts, will\nmean that the provision will not and cannot be lawfully enforced\nagainst others. The Court and Justice Thomas take different\nanalytical paths, but in many cases, the different paths lead to\nthe same place.9On occasion, of course,\nit may be that a particular surrounding or connected provision is\nnot operative in the absence of the unconstitutional provision,\neven though the rest of the law would be operative. That scenario\nmay require severance of somewhat more than just the offending\nprovision, albeit not of the entire law. Courts address that\nscenario as it arises.10A\ncodifier\u2019s note explains a change in wording from the original\nPublic Law: \u201cThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original\n\u2018this Act\u2019, meaning act June 19, 1934, ch. 652, 48Stat. 1064, known\nas the Communications Act of 1934, which is classified principally\nto this chapter.\u201d Note following 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7608.11The\ncases cited in the text above are pre-Eriedecisions\ninvolving the constitutionality of state laws.SeeErie\nR. Co.v.Tompkins,304 U.S.\n64(1938). In that era, the Court often treated severability of\nstate laws and federal laws in the same general way. In the\npost-Erieera, severability of state laws can potentially\npose different questions than severability of federal laws. We need\nnot address post-Erieseverability of state laws. See,e.g.,Ayottev.Planned Parenthood of Northern New\nEng.,546 U.S.\n320, 328\u2013331 (2006);Leavittv.Jane L.,518 U.S.\n137, 139 (1996) (per curiam) (\u201cSeverability is of course\na matter of state law\u201d).12As\nthe Government acknowledges, although our decision means the end of\nthe government-debt exception, no one should be penalized or held\nliable for making robocalls to collect government debt after the\neffective date of the 2015 government-debt exception and before the\nentry of final judgment by the District Court on remand in this\ncase, or such date that the lower courts determine is appropriate.\nSee Reply Brief 24. On the other side of the ledger, our decision\ntoday does not negate the liability of parties who made robocalls\ncovered by the robocall restriction.13Plaintiffs\nsuggest that parties will not have incentive to sue if the cure for\nchallenging an unconstitutional exception to a speech restriction\nis to eliminate the exception and extend the restriction. But many\nindividuals and organizations often have incentive to challenge\nunequal treatment of speech, especially when a competitor is\nregulated less heavily.",
