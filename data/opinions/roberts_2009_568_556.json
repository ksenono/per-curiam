S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-5274CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL DEAN, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[April 29, 2009]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.Accidents happen. Sometimes they\nhappen to individuals committing crimes with loaded guns. The\nquestion here is whether extra punishment Congress imposed for the\ndischarge of a gun during certain crimes applies when the gun goes\noff accidentally.ITitle 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a firearm during and\nin relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing\na firearm in furtherance of such a crime. An individual convicted\nof that offense receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in\naddition to the punishment for the underlying crime.\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum increases to 7 years \u201cif\nthe firearm is brandished\u201d and to 10 years \u201cif the firearm is\ndischarged.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).In this case, a masked man\nentered a bank, waved a gun, and yelled at everyone to get down. He\nthen walked behind the teller counter and started removing money\nfrom the teller stations. He grabbed bills with his left hand,\nholding the gun in his right. At one point, he reached over a\nteller to remove money from her drawer. As he was collecting the\nmoney, the gun discharged, leaving a bullet hole in the partition\nbetween two stations. The robber cursed and dashed out of the bank.\nWitnesses later testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had\ngone off. No one was hurt. App. 16\u201319, 24, 27, 47\u201348, 79.Police arrested Christopher Michael Dean and\nRicardo Curtis Lopez for the crime. Both defendants were charged\nwith conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate commerce,\nin violation of 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71951(a), and aiding and abetting\neach other in using, carrying, possessing, and discharging a\nfirearm during an armed robbery, in violation of \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\nand \u00a72. App. 11\u201312. At trial, Dean admitted that he had committed\nthe robbery,id., at 76\u201381, and a jury found him guilty on\nboth the robbery and firearm counts. The District Court sentenced\nDean to a mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison on the\nfirearm count, because the firearm \u201cdischarged\u201d during the robbery.\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136.Dean appealed, contending that the discharge\nwas accidental, and that the sentencing enhancement in\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant intended to\ndischarge the firearm. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that\nseparate proof of intent was not required. 517 F.\u00a03d 1224,\n1229 (CA11 2008). That decision created a conflict among the\nCircuits over whether the accidental discharge of a firearm during\nthe specified crimes gives rise to the 10-year mandatory minimum.\nSeeUnited Statesv. Brown, 449 F.\u00a03d 154\n(CADC 2006) (holding that it does not). We granted certiorari to\nresolve that conflict. 555 U. S. ____ (2008).IISection 924(c)(1)(A)\nprovides:\u201c[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any\ncrime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a\nfirearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\nfirearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such\ncrime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2014\u201c(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of\nnot less than 5 years;\u201c(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years;\nand\u201c(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\u201dThe principal paragraph defines a\ncomplete offense and the subsections \u201cexplain how defendants are to\n\u2018be sentenced.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHarrisv.United States,536 U. S. 545,\n552 (2002). Subsection (i) \u201csets a catchall minimum\u201d sentence of\nnot less than five years.Id., at 552\u2013553. Subsections\n(ii) and (iii) increase the minimum penalty if the firearm \u201cis\nbrandished\u201d or \u201cis discharged.\u201d Seeid., at 553. The\nparties disagree over whether \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a\nrequirement that the defendant intend to discharge the firearm. We\nhold that it does not.A\u201cWe start, as always, with the\nlanguage of the statute.\u201dWilliamsv.Taylor,529 U. S. 420,\n431 (2000). The text of subsection (iii) provides that a defendant\nshall be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years \u201cif the firearm is\ndischarged.\u201d It does not require that the discharge be done\nknowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of\nlimitation. As we explained inBatesv.United\nStates,522 U.\nS. 23(1997), in declining to infer an \u201c\u00a0\u2018intent to\ndefraud\u2019\u00a0\u201d requirement into a statute, \u201cwe ordinarily resist\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its\nface.\u201dId., at 29.Congress\u2019s use of the passive\nvoice further indicates that subsection (iii) does not require\nproof of intent. The passive voice focuses on an event that occurs\nwithout respect to a specific actor, and therefore without respect\nto any actor\u2019s intent or culpability. Cf.Watsonv.United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7)\n(use of passive voice in statutory phrase \u201cto be used\u201d in 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(d)(1) reflects \u201cagnosticism \u2026 about who does the\nusing\u201d). It is whether something happened\u2014not how or why it\nhappened\u2014that matters.The structure of the statute also suggests\nthat subsection (iii) is not limited to the intentional discharge\nof a firearm. Subsection (ii) provides a 7-year mandatory minimum\nsentence if the firearm \u201cis brandished.\u201d Congress expressly\nincluded an intent requirement for that provision, by defining\n\u201cbrandish\u201d to mean \u201cto display all or part of the firearm, or\notherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person,in order tointimidatethat person.\u201d \u00a7924(c)(4)\n(emphasis added). The defendant must have intended to brandish the\nfirearm, because the brandishing must have been done for a specific\npurpose. Congress did not, however, separately define \u201cdischarge\u201d\nto include an intent requirement. \u201c[W]here Congress includes\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate\ninclusion or exclusion.\u201dRussellov.United\nStates,464 U.\nS. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).Dean argues that the statute is not silent on\nthe question presented. Congress, he contends, included an intent\nelement in the opening paragraph of \u00a7924(c)(1)(A), and that element\nextends to the sentencing enhancements. Section 924(c)(1)(A)\ncriminalizes using or carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation\nto\u201d any violent or drug trafficking crime. InSmithv.\nUnited States,508 U. S. 223(1993), we\nstated that the phrase \u201cin relation to\u201d means \u201cthat the firearm\nmust have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug\ntrafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result\nof accident or coincidence.\u201dId., at 238. Dean argues that\nthe adverbial phrase thus necessarily embodies an intent\nrequirement, and that the phrase modifies all the verbs in the\nstatute\u2014not only use, carry, and possess, but also brandish and\ndischarge. Such a reading requires that a perpetrator knowingly\ndischarge the firearm for the enhancement to apply. If the\ndischarge is accidental, Dean argues, it is not \u201cin relation to\u201d\nthe underlying crime.The most natural reading of the statute,\nhowever, is that \u201cin relation to\u201d modifies only the nearby verbs\n\u201cuses\u201d and \u201ccarries.\u201d The next verb\u2014\u201cpossesses\u201d\u2014is modified by its\nown adverbial clause, \u201cin furtherance of.\u201d The last two verbs\u2014\u201cis\nbrandished\u201d and \u201cis discharged\u201d\u2014appear in separate subsections and\nare in a different voice than the verbs in the principal paragraph.\nThere is no basis for reading \u201cin relation to\u201d to extend all the\nway down to modify \u201cis discharged.\u201d The better reading of the\nstatute is that the adverbial phrases in the opening paragraph\u2014\u201cin\nrelation to\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of\u201d\u2014modify their respective nearby\nverbs, and that neither phrase extends to the sentencing\nfactors.But, Dean argues, such a reading will lead to\nabsurd results. The discharge provision on its face contains no\ntemporal or causal limitations. In the absence of an intent\nrequirement, the enhancement would apply \u201cregardless of when the\nactions occur, or by whom or for what reason they are taken.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 11\u201312. It would, for example, apply if the gun used\nduring the crime were discharged \u201cweeks (or years) before or after\nthe crime.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 11.We do not agree that implying an intent\nrequirement is necessary to address such concerns. As the\nGovernment recognizes, sentencing factors such as the one here\n\u201coften involve . . . special features of the manner in which a\nbasic crime was carried out.\u201d Brief for United States 29 (quotingHarris,536 U. S., at 553; internal quotation marks\nomitted). The basic crime here is using or carrying a firearm\nduring and in relation to a violent or drug trafficking crime, or\npossessing a firearm in furtherance of any such crime. Fanciful\nhypotheticals testing whether the discharge was a \u201cspecial\nfeatur[e]\u201d of how the \u201cbasic crime was carried out,\u201dHarris, 536 U. S., at 553 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), are best addressed in those terms, not by contorting and\nstretching the statutory language to imply an intent\nrequirement.BDean further argues that even if\nthe statute is viewed as silent on the intent question, that\nsilence compels a ruling in his favor. There is, he notes, a\npresumption that criminal prohibitions include a requirement that\nthe Government prove the defendant intended the conduct made\ncriminal. In light of this presumption, we have \u201con a number of\noccasions read a state-of-mind component into an offense even when\nthe statutory definition did not in terms so provide.\u201dUnited\nStatesv.United States Gypsum Co.,438 U. S. 422, 437\n(1978). \u201c[S]ome indication of congressional intent, express or\nimplied, is required to dispense withmens reaas an\nelement of a crime.\u201dStaplesv.United States,511 U. S. 600,\n606 (1994).Dean argues that the presumption\nis especially strong in this case, given the structure and purpose\nof the statute. In his view, the three subsections are intended to\nprovide harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct: a\n5-year minimum for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm; a\n7-year minimum for brandishing a firearm; and a 10-year minimum for\ndischarging a firearm. Incorporating an intent requirement into the\ndischarge provision is necessary to give effect to that\nprogression, because an accidental discharge is less culpable than\nintentional brandishment. SeeBrown, 449 F. 3d, at\n156.It is unusual to impose criminal punishment\nfor the consequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not\nunusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of\ntheirunlawfulacts. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw \u00a714.4, pp. 436\u2013437 (2d ed. 2003). The felony-murder rule is a\nfamiliar example: If a defendant commits an unintended homicide\nwhile committing another felony, the defendant can be convicted of\nmurder. See 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71111. The Sentencing Guidelines\nreflect the same principle. See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72A2.2(b)(3) (Nov. 2008) (USSG)\n(increasing offense level for aggravated assault according to the\nseriousness of the injury); \u00a72D2.3 (increasing offense level for\noperating or directing the operation of a common carrier under the\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs if death or serious bodily injury\nresults).Blackstone expressed the idea in the following\nterms:\u201c[I]f any accidental mischief happens to follow\nfrom the performance of alawfulact, the party stands\nexcused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thingunlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not\nforesee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his want of\nforesight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty of one offence, in\ndoing antecedently what is in itself unlawful, he is criminally\nguilty of whatever consequence may follow the first misbehaviour.\u201d\n4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 26\u201327\n(1769).Here the defendant is already guilty of unlawful\nconduct twice over: a violent or drug trafficking offense and the\nuse, carrying, or possession of a firearm in the course of that\noffense. That unlawful conduct was not an accident. SeeSmith, 508 U. S., at 238.The fact that the actual discharge of a gun\ncovered under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii) may be accidental does not mean\nthat the defendant is blameless. The sentencing enhancement in\nsubsection (iii) accounts for the risk of harm resulting from the\nmanner in which the crime is carried out, for which the defendant\nis responsible. SeeHarris,supra, at 553. An\nindividual who brings a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the\nrisk that the gun will discharge accidentally. A gunshot in such\ncircumstances\u2014whether accidental or intended\u2014increases the risk\nthat others will be injured, that people will panic, or that\nviolence (with its own danger to those nearby) will be used in\nresponse. Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for an\ninadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm, handle it\nwith care during the underlying violent or drug trafficking crime,\nleave the gun at home, or\u2014best yet\u2014avoid committing the felony in\nthe first place.Justice Stevens contends that the statute\nshould be read to require a showing of intent because harm\nresulting from a discharge may be punishable under other\nprovisions, such as the Sentencing Guidelines (but only if \u201cbodily\ninjury\u201d results).Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (citing\nUSSG \u00a72B3.1(b)(3)). But Congress in \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(iii) elected to\nimpose a mandatory term, without regard to more generally\napplicable sentencing provisions. Punishment available under such\nprovisions therefore does not suggest that the statute at issue\nhere is limited to intentional discharges.And although the point is not relevant under\nthe correct reading of the statute, it is wrong to assert that the\ngunshot here \u201ccaused no harm.\u201dPost, at 1. By pure luck,\nno one was killed or wounded. But the gunshot plainly added to the\ntrauma experienced by those held during the armed robbery. See,e.g., App. 22 (the gunshot \u201cshook us all\u201d);ibid.\n(\u201cMelissa in the lobby popped up and said, \u2018oh, my God, has he shot\nNora?\u2019\u00a0\u201d).CDean finally argues that any\ndoubts about the proper interpretation of the statute should be\nresolved in his favor under the rule of lenity. See Brief for\nPetitioner 6. \u201cThe simple existence of some statutory ambiguity,\nhowever, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for\nmost statutes are ambiguous to some degree.\u201dMuscarellov.United States,524 U. S. 125, 138\n(1998); see alsoSmith,supra, at 239 (\u201cThe mere\npossibility of articulating a narrower construction, however, does\nnot by itself make the rule of lenity applicable\u201d). \u201cTo invoke the\nrule, we must conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or\nuncertainty in the statute.\u201dMuscarello,supra,\nat 138\u2013139 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the\nstatutory text and structure convince us that the discharge\nprovision does not contain an intent requirement. Dean\u2019s contrary\narguments are not enough to render the statute grievously\nambiguous.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\nrequires no separate proof of intent. The 10-year mandatory minimum\napplies if a gun is discharged in the course of a violent or drug\ntraffick- ing crime, whether on purpose or by accident. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is\naffirmed.It is so ordered.",
