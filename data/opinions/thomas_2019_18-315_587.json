The first\nperiod requires that the action be brought within 6 years after the\nstatutory violation occurred. The second period requires that the\naction be brought within 3 years after the United States official\ncharged with the responsibility to act knew or should have known\nthe relevant facts, but not more than 10 years after the violation.\nWhichever period provides the later date serves as the limitations\nperiod.This case requires us to decide how to calculate\nthe limitations period forqui\u00a0tamsuits in which the\nUnited States does not intervene. The Court of Appeals held that\nthese suits are \u201ccivil action[s] under section 3730\u201d and that the\nlimitations periods in \u00a73731(b) apply in accordance with their\nterms, regardless of whether the United States intervenes. It\nfurther held that, for purposes of the second period, the private\nperson who initiates thequi\u00a0tamsuit cannot be deemed\nthe official of the United States. We agree, and therefore\naffirm.IAs relevant, the False Claims Act imposes\ncivil liability on \u201cany person\u201d who \u201cknowingly presents, or causes\nto be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or\napproval\u201d to the Government or to certain third parties acting on\nthe Government\u2019s behalf. 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73729(a), (b)(2).\nSection 3730 authorizes two types of actions: First, the Attorney\nGeneral, who \u201cdiligently shall investigate a violation under\nsection 3729,\u201d may bring a civil action against the alleged false\nclaimant. \u00a73730(a). Second, a private person, known as a relator,\nmay bring aqui tamcivil action \u201cfor the person and for the\nUnited States Government\u201d against the alleged false claimant, \u201cin\nthe name of the Government.\u201d \u00a73730(b).If a relator initiates the action, he must\ndeliver a copy of the complaint and supporting evidence to the\nGovernment, which then has 60 days to intervene in the action.\n\u00a7\u00a73730(b)(2), (4). During this time, the complaint remains sealed.\n\u00a73730(b)(2). If the Government intervenes, it assumes primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the action, though the relator may\ncontinue to participate. \u00a73730(c). Otherwise, the relator has the\nright to pursue the action. \u00a7\u00a73730(b)(4), (c)(3). Even if it does\nnot intervene, the Government is entitled to be served with all\npleadings upon request and may intervene at any time with good\ncause. \u00a73730(c)(3). The relator receives a share of any proceeds\nfrom the action\u2014generally 15 to 25 percent if the Government\nintervenes, and 25 to 30 percent if it does not\u2014plus attorney\u2019s\nfees and costs. \u00a7\u00a73730(d)(1)\u2013(2). SeeVermont Agency of Natural\nResourcesv.United States ex rel. Stevens,529 U.S.\n765, 769\u2013770 (2000).At issue here is the Act\u2019s statute of\nlimitations, which provides:\u201c(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not\nbe brought\u2014\u201c(1) more than 6 years after the date on which\nthe violation of section 3729 is committed, or\u201c(2) more than 3 years after the date when\nfacts material to the right of action are known or reasonably\nshould have been known by the official of the United States charged\nwith responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event\nmore than 10 years after the date on which the violation is\ncommitted,\u201cwhichever occurs last.\u201d \u00a73731(b).On November 27, 2013, respondent Billy Joe Hunt\nfiled a complaint alleging that petitioners\u2014two defense contractors\n(collectively, Cochise)\u2014defrauded the Government by submitting\nfalse claims for payment under a subcontract to provide security\nservices in Iraq \u201cfrom some time prior to January 2006 until early\n2007.\u201d App. 43a. A little less than three years before bringing his\ncomplaint, Hunt was interviewed by federal agents about his role in\nan unrelated contracting fraud in Iraq. Hunt claims to have\nrevealed Cochise\u2019s allegedly fraudulent scheme during this November\n30, 2010, interview.The United States declined to intervene in\nHunt\u2019s action, and Cochise moved to dismiss the complaint as barred\nby the statute of limitations. Hunt conceded that the 6-year\nlimitations period in \u00a73731(b)(1) had elapsed before he filed suit\non November 27, 2013. But Hunt argued that his complaint was timely\nunder \u00a73731(b)(2) because it was filed within 3 years of the\ninterview in which he informed federal agents about the alleged\nfraud (and within 10 years after the violation occurred).The District Court dismissed the action. It\nconsidered three potential interpretations of \u00a73731(b). Under the\nfirst interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) does not apply to a\nrelator-initiated action in which the Government elects not to\nintervene, so any such action must be filed within six years after\nthe violation. Under the second interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) applies\nin nonintervened actions, and the limitations period begins when\nthe relator knew or should have known the relevant facts. Under the\nthird interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in nonintervened actions,\nand the limitations period begins when \u201cthe official of the United\nStates charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances\u201d\nknew or should have known the relevant facts. The District Court\nrejected the third interpretation and declined to choose between\nthe first two because it found that Hunt\u2019s complaint would be\nuntimely under either. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded,\nadopting the third interpretation. 887 F.3d 1081 (CA11 2018).Given a conflict between the Courts of\nAppeals,[1]* we granted\ncertiorari. 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).IIThe first question before us is whether the\nlimitations period in \u00a73731(b)(2) is available in a\nrelator-initiated suit in which the Government has declined to\nintervene. If so, the second question is whether the relator in\nsuch a case should be considered \u201cthe official of the United\nStates\u201d whose knowledge triggers \u00a73731(b)(2)\u2019s 3-year limitations\nperiod.ASection 3731(b) sets forth two limitations\nperiods that apply to \u201ccivil action[s] under section 3730.\u201d Both\nGovernment-initiated suits under \u00a73730(a) and relator-initiated\nsuits under \u00a73730(b) are \u201ccivil action[s] under section 3730.\u201d\nThus, the plain text of the statute makes the two limitations\nperiods applicable in both types of suits.Cochise agrees with that view as to the\nlimitations period in \u00a73731(b)(1), but argues that the period in\n\u00a73731(b)(2) is available in a relator-initiated suit only if the\nGovernment intervenes. According to Cochise, starting a limitations\nperiod when the party entitled to bring a claim learns the relevant\nfacts is a default rule of tolling provisions, so subsection (b)(2)\nshould be read to apply only when the Government is a party. In\nshort, under Cochise\u2019s reading, a relator-initiated, nonintervened\nsuit is a \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d for purposes of\nsubsection (b)(1) but not subsection (b)(2).This reading is at odds with fundamental rules\nof statutory interpretation. In all but the most unusual\nsituations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed\nmeaning. SeeRatzlafv.United States,510 U.S.\n135, 143 (1994). We therefore avoid interpretations that would\n\u201cattribute different meanings to the same phrase.\u201dRenov.Bossier Parish School Bd.,528 U.S.\n320, 329 (2000). Here, either a relator-initiated,\nnonintervened suit is a \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d\u2014and thus\nsubject to the limitations periods in subsections (b)(1) and\n(b)(2)\u2014or it is not. It is such an action. Whatever the default\ntolling rule might be, the clear text of the statute controls this\ncase.Under Cochise\u2019s reading, a relator-initiated\ncivil action would convert to \u201c[a] civil action under section 3730\u201d\nfor purposes of subsection (b)(2) if and when the Government\nintervenes. That reading cannot be correct. If the Government\nintervenes, the civil action remains the same\u2014it simply has one\nadditional party. There is no textual basis to base the meaning of\n\u201c[a] civil action under section 3730\u201d on whether the Government has\nintervened.Cochise relies on our decision inGraham\nCounty Soil & Water Conservation Dist.v.United States\nex rel. Wilson,545 U.S.\n409(2005), which addressed the question whether \u00a73731(b)(1) or\nfederal common law provided the limitations period for \u00a73730(h)\nretaliation actions. Section 3730(h) creates a cause of action for\nan employee who suffers retaliation for, among other things,\nassisting with the prosecution of a False Claims Act action. At the\ntime, \u00a73730(h) did not specify a time limit for bringing a\nretaliation action, so the question before us was whether the\nphrase \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d in \u00a73731(b) encompassed\nactions under \u00a73730(h). We considered the statute \u201cambiguous\nbecause its text, literally read, admits of two plausible\ninterpretations.\u201dId., at 419, n.\u00a02. One reading was\nthat a \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d includes \u00a73730(h) actions\nbecause such actions arise under \u00a73730.Id., at 415.\n\u201cAnother reasonable reading\u201d was that a \u201ccivil action under section\n3730\u201d \u201capplies only to actions arising under \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b)\u201d\nbecause \u201c\u00a73731(b)(1) t[ies] the start of the time limit to \u2018the\ndate on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.That reading had force because retaliation claims need\nnot involve an actual violation of \u00a73729.Ibid.Looking to\nstatutory context, we explained that the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018civil\naction under section 3730\u2019 means only those civil actions under\n\u00a73730 that have as an element a \u2018violation of section 3729,\u2019 that\nis, \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b) actions\u201d\u2014not \u00a73730(h) retaliation actions.Id., at 421\u2013422.A relator-initiated, nonintervened suit arises\nunder \u00a73730(b) and has as an element a violation of \u00a73729.Graham Countysupports our reading. Nonetheless, Cochise\npoints out that in considering the statutory context, we discussed\na similar phrase contained in \u00a73731(c) (now \u00a73731(d)), which\nstated: \u201cInany action brought under section 3730, the\nUnited States shall be required to prove all essential elements of\nthe cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We explained that \u00a73731(c) \u201cuse[d] the\nsimilarly unqualified phrase \u2018action brought under section 3730\u2019 to\nrefer only to \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b) actions.\u201dId., at 417\u2013418.\nWe then stated: \u201cAs [respondent] and the United States concede, the\ncontext of this provision implies that the phrase \u2018any action\nbrought under section 3730\u2019 is limited to \u00a73730(a) actions brought\nby the United States and \u00a73730(b) actions in which the United\nStates intervenes as a party, as those are the types of \u00a73730\nactions in which the United States necessarily participates.\u201dId., at 418.Cochise contends that we should adopt a similar\nconstruction of the phrase \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d in\n\u00a73731(b). We disagree. Our discussion of \u00a73731(c) was focused on\n\u201cthe context of th[at] provision\u201d and on whether it could be read\nto impose the burden of proof on the Government even in cases where\nthe Government did not participate.Id., at 418. Those\nconsiderations do not apply here; there is nothing illogical about\nreading \u00a73731(b) to apply in accordance with its plain terms.\nMoreover, if a \u201ccivil action under section 3730\u201d included only an\naction in which the Government participates for purposes of\n\u00a73731(b)(2), then we would be obligated to give it a like meaning\nfor purposes of \u00a73731(b)(1). This would mean that a\nrelator-initiated, nonintervened suit would be subject to neither\n\u00a73731(b)(1) nor \u00a73731(b)(2)\u2014a reading Cochise expressly disclaims.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 20, n.\u00a03. Nothing inGraham\nCountysupports giving the same phrase in \u00a73731(b) two\ndifferent meanings depending on whether the Government\nintervenes.Again pointing toGraham County, Cochise\nnext contends that our reading would lead to\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018counterintuitive results.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brief for Petitioners 26.\nFor instance, if the Government discovers the fraud on the day it\noccurred, it would have 6 years to bring suit, but if a relator\ninstead discovers the fraud on the day it occurred and the\nGovernment does not discover it, the relator could have as many as\n10 years to bring suit. That discrepancy arises because \u00a73731(b)(2)\nbegins its limitations period on the date that \u201cthe official of the\nUnited States charged with responsibility to act\u201d obtained\nknowledge of the relevant facts. But we see nothing unusual about\nextending the limitations period when the Government official did\nnot know and should not reasonably have known the relevant facts,\ngiven that the Government is the party harmed by the false claim\nand will receive the bulk of any recovery. See \u00a73730(d). In any\nevent, a result that \u201cmay seem odd .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not absurd.\u201dExxon Mobil Corp.v.Allapattah Services,Inc.,545 U.S.\n546, 565 (2005). Although inGrahamCountywe\nsought \u201ca construction that avoids .\u00a0.\u00a0. counterintuitive\nresults,\u201d there the text \u201cadmit[ted] of two plausible\ninterpretations.\u201d 545 U.\u00a0S., at 421, 419, n.\u00a02. Here,\nCochise points to no other plausible interpretation of the text, so\nthe \u201c\u00a0\u2018judicial inquiry is complete.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBarnhartv.Sigmon Coal Co.,534 U.S.\n438, 462 (2002).BCochise\u2019s fallback argument is that the\nrelator in a nonintervened suit should be considered \u201cthe official\nof the United States charged with responsibility to act in the\ncircumstances,\u201d meaning that \u00a73731(b)(2)\u2019s 3-year limitations\nperiod would start when the relator knew or should have known about\nthe fraud. But the statute provides no support for reading \u201cthe\nofficial of the United States\u201d to encompass a private relator.First, a private relator is not an \u201cofficial of\nthe United States\u201d in the ordinary sense of that phrase. A relator\nis neither appointed as an officer of the United States, see\nU.\u00a0S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2, nor employed by the United\nStates. Indeed, the provision that authorizesqui tamsuits\nis entitled \u201cActions by Private Persons.\u201d \u00a73730(b). Although that\nprovision explains that the action is brought \u201cfor the person and\nfor the United States Government\u201d and \u201cin the name of the\nGovernment,\u201dibid., it does not make the relator anything\nother than a private person, much less \u201cthe official of the United\nStates\u201d referenced by the statute. Cf.Stevens, 529\nU.\u00a0S., at 773, n.\u00a04 (\u201c[A]qui tamrelator is, in\neffect, suing as a partial as- signee of the United States\u201d\n(emphasis deleted)).Second, the statute refers to \u201cthe\u201d official\n\u201ccharged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.\u201d The\nGovernment argues that, in context, \u201cthe\u201d official refers to the\nAttorney General (or his delegate), who by statute \u201cshall\ninvestigate a violation under section 3729.\u201d \u00a73730(a). Regardless\nof precisely which official or officials the statute is referring\nto, \u00a73731(b)(2)\u2019s use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d suggests that\nCongress did not intend for any and all private relators to be\nconsidered \u201cthe official of the United States.\u201d SeeRumsfeldv.Padilla,542 U.S.\n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite\narticle .\u00a0.\u00a0. indicates that there is generally only one\u201d\nperson covered). More fundamentally, private relators are not\n\u201ccharged with responsibility to act\u201d in the sense contemplated by\n\u00a73731(b), as they are not required to investigate or prosecute a\nFalse Claims Act action.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals isAffirmed.Notes1*Compare 887 F.3d 1081,\n1089\u20131097 (CA11 2018) (adopting the third interpretation), withUnited States ex rel.
