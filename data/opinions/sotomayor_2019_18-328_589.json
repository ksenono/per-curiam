    "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES_________________No. 18\u2013328_________________KEVIN C. ROTKISKE, PETITIONERv.PAUL\nKLEMM, et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit[December 10, 2019]Justice Sotomayor, concurring.Like my colleagues in both the majority and the\npartial dissent, I agree that 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(d) is a\none-year statute of limitations that typically begins to run when\nthe alleged violation \u201coccurs,\u201d not when the plaintiff discovers\nit. Compareante, at 1, withpost, at 1 (Ginsburg,\nJ., dissenting in part and from judgment). The only daylight\nbetween the majority and dissenting opinions is whether petitioner\nRotkiske forfeited reliance on an \u201cequitable, fraud-specific\ndiscovery rule\u201d that forgives otherwise untimely filings.Ante, at 6\u20137; cf.post, at 4\u20135. Because I believe the\nCourt of Appeals fairly found that Rotkiske failed to preserve an\nequitable argument of this sort, see 890 F.3d 422, 429, and\nn.\u00a05 (CA3 2018), and because the Court did not grant\ncertiorari on that doctrine, I join the majority opinion.I write separately to emphasize that this\nfraud-specific equitable principle is not the \u201c\u00a0\u2018bad wine of\nrecent vintage\u2019\u00a0\u201d of which my colleagues speak.Ante,\nat 5 (quotingTRW Inc.v.Andrews,534 U.S.\n19, 37 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). Rather,\nthe Court has long \u201crecogni[zed]\u201d and applied this \u201chistorical\nexception for suits based on fraud.\u201dId., at 37; see alsoid., at 27 (majority opinion) (noting equitable discovery\nrule \u201cin cases of fraud or concealment\u201d);Holmbergv.Armbrecht,327 U.S.\n392(1946);Exploration Co.v.United States,247 U.S.\n435(1918);Baileyv.Glover, 21 Wall. 342\n(1875);Sherwoodv.Sutton, 21 F. Cas. 1303 (No.\n12,782) (CC NH 1828) (Story, J.). Nothing in today\u2019s decision\nprevents parties from invoking that well-settled doctrine.",
