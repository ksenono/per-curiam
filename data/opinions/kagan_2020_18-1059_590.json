The cause was an unannounced\nrealignment of 12 toll lanes leading to the George Washington\nBridge, an entryway into Manhattan administered by the Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey. For decades, three of those\naccess lanes had been reserved during morning rush hour for\ncommuters coming from the streets of Fort Lee. But on these four\ndays\u2014with predictable consequences\u2014only a single lane was set\naside. The public officials who ordered that change claimed they\nwere reducing the number of dedicated lanes to conduct a traffic\nstudy. In fact, they did so for a political reason\u2014to punish the\nmayor of Fort Lee for refusing to support the New Jersey Governor\u2019s\nreelection bid.Exposure of their behavior led to the criminal\nconvictions we review here. The Government charged the responsible\nofficials under the federal statutes prohibiting wire fraud and\nfraud on a federally funded program or entity. See 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71343, 666(a)(1)(A). Both those laws target\nfraudulent schemes for obtaining property. See \u00a71343 (barring\nfraudulent schemes \u201cfor obtaining money or property\u201d);\n\u00a7666(a)(1)(A) (making it a crime to \u201cobtain[\u00a0] by fraud\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. property\u201d). The jury convicted the defendants, and\nthe lower courts upheld the verdicts.The question presented is whether the defendants\ncommitted property fraud. The evidence the jury heard no doubt\nshows wrongdoing\u2014deception, corruption, abuse of power. But the\nfederal fraud statutes at issue do not criminalize all such\nconduct. Under settled precedent, the officials could violate those\nlaws only if an object of their dishonesty was to obtain the Port\nAuthority\u2019s money or property. The Government contends it was,\nbecause the officials sought both to \u201ccommandeer\u201d the Bridge\u2019s\naccess lanes and to divert the wage labor of the Port Authority\nemployees used in that effort. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. We disagree.\nThe realignment of the toll lanes was an exercise of regulatory\npower\u2014something this Court has already held fails to meet the\nstatutes\u2019 property requirement. And the employees\u2019 labor was just\nthe incidental cost of that regulation, rather than itself an\nobject of the officials\u2019 scheme. We therefore reverse the\nconvictions.IThe setting of this case is the George\nWashington Bridge. Running between Fort Lee and Manhattan, it is\nthe busiest motor-vehicle bridge in the world. Twelve lanes with\ntollbooths feed onto the Bridge\u2019s upper level from the Fort Lee\nside. Decades ago, the then-Governor of New Jersey committed to a\nset allocation of those lanes for the morning commute. And (save\nfor the four days soon described) his plan has lasted to this day.\nUnder the arrangement, nine of the lanes carry traffic coming from\nnearby highways. The three remaining lanes, designated by a long\nline of traffic cones laid down each morning, serve only cars\ncoming from Fort Lee.The case\u2019s cast of characters are public\nofficials who worked at or with the Port Authority and had\npolitical ties to New Jersey\u2019s then-Governor Chris Christie. The\nPort Authority is a bi-state agency that manages bridges, tunnels,\nairports, and other transportation facilities in New York and New\nJersey. At the time relevant here, William Baroni was its Deputy\nExecutive Director, an appointee of Governor Christie and the\nhighest ranking New Jersey official in the agency. Together with\nthe Executive Director (a New York appointee), he oversaw \u201call\naspects of the Port Authority\u2019s business,\u201d including operation of\nthe George Washington Bridge. App. 21 (indictment). David Wildstein\n(who became the Government\u2019s star witness) functioned as Baroni\u2019s\nchief of staff. And Bridget Anne Kelly was a Deputy Chief of Staff\nto Governor Christie with special responsibility for managing his\nrelations with local officials. She often worked hand-in-hand with\nBaroni and Wildstein to deploy the Port Authority\u2019s resources in\nways that would encourage mayors and other local figures to support\nthe Governor.The fateful lane change arose out of one mayor\u2019s\nresistance to such blandishments. In 2013, Governor Christie was up\nfor reelection, and he wanted to notch a large, bipartisan victory\nas he ramped up for a presidential campaign. On his behalf, Kelly\navidly courted Democratic mayors for their endorsements\u2014among them,\nMark Sokolich of Fort Lee. As a result, that town received some\nvaluable benefits from the Port Authority, including an expensive\nshuttle-bus service. But that summer, Mayor Sokolich informed\nKelly\u2019s office that he would not back the Governor\u2019s campaign. A\nfrustrated Kelly reached out to Wildstein for ideas on how to\nrespond. He suggested that getting rid of the dedicated Fort Lee\nlanes on the Bridge\u2019s toll plaza would cause rush-hour traffic to\nback up onto local streets, leading to gridlock there. Kelly agreed\nto the idea in an admirably concise e-mail: \u201cTime for some traffic\nproblems in Fort Lee.\u201d App. 917 (trial exhibit). In a later phone\nconversation, Kelly confirmed to Wildstein that she wanted to\n\u201ccreat[e] a traffic jam that would punish\u201d Mayor Sokolich and \u201csend\nhim a message.\u201dId., at 254 (Wildstein testimony). And after\nWildstein relayed those communications, Baroni gave the needed\nsign-off.To complete the scheme, Wildstein then devised\n\u201ca cover story\u201d\u2014that the lane change was part of a traffic study,\nintended to assess whether to retain the dedicated Fort Lee lanes\nin the future.Id.,at 264. Wildstein, Baroni, and Kelly all\nagreed to use that \u201cpublic policy\u201d justification when speaking with\nthe media, local officials, and the Port Authority\u2019s own employees.Id.,at 265. And to give their story credibility, Wildstein\nin fact told the Port Authority\u2019s engineers to collect \u201csome\nnumbers on how[\u00a0] far back the traffic was delayed.\u201dId.,at 305. That inquiry bore little resemblance to the\nPort Authority\u2019s usual traffic studies. According to one engineer\u2019s\ntrial testimony, the Port Authority never closes lanes to study\ntraffic patterns, because \u201ccomputer-generated model[ing]\u201d can\nitself predict the effect of such actions.Id., at 484\n(testimony of Umang Patel); seeid.,at 473\u2013474 (similar\ntestimony of Victor Chung). And the information that the Port\nAuthority\u2019s engineers collected on this singular occasion was\nmostly \u201cnot useful\u201d and \u201cdiscarded.\u201dId., at 484\u2013485 (Patel\ntestimony). Nor did Wildstein or Baroni show any interest in the\ndata. They never asked to review what the engineers had found;\nindeed, they learned of the results only weeks later, after a\njournalist filed a public-records request. So although the\nengineers spent valuable time assessing the lane change, their work\nwas to no practical effect.Baroni, Wildstein, and Kelly also agreed to\nincur another cost\u2014for extra toll collectors\u2014in pursuit of their\nobject. Wildstein\u2019s initial thought was to eliminate all three\ndedicated lanes by not laying down any traffic cones, thus turning\nthe whole toll plaza into a free-for-all. But the Port Authority\u2019s\nchief engineer told him that without the cones \u201cthere would be a\nsubstantial risk of sideswipe crashes\u201d involving cars coming into\nthe area from different directions.Id., at 284 (Wildstein\ntestimony). So Wildstein went back to Baroni and Kelly and got\ntheir approval to keep one lane reserved for Fort Lee traffic. That\nsolution, though, raised another complication. Ordinarily, if a\ntoll collector on a Fort Lee lane has to take a break, he closes\nhis booth, and drivers use one of the other two lanes. Under the\none-lane plan, of course, that would be impossible. So the Bridge\nmanager told Wildstein that to make the scheme work, \u201can extra toll\ncollector\u201d would always have to be \u201con call\u201d to relieve the regular\ncollector when he went on break.Id.,at 303. Once again,\nWildstein took the news to Baroni and Kelly. Baroni thought it was\n\u201cfunny,\u201d remarking that \u201conly at the Port Authority would [you]\nhave to pay a toll collector to just sit there and wait.\u201dIbid.Still, he and Kelly gave the okay.The plan was now ready, and on September 9 it\nwent into effect. Without advance notice and on the (traffic-heavy)\nfirst day of school, Port Authority employees placed traffic cones\ntwo lanes further to the right than usual, restricting cars from\nFort Lee to a single lane. Almost immediately, the town\u2019s streets\ncame to a standstill. According to the Fort Lee Chief of Police,\nthe traffic rivaled that of 9/11, when the George Washington Bridge\nhad shut down. School buses stood in place for hours. An ambulance\nstruggled to reach the victim of a heart attack; police had trouble\nresponding to a report of a missing child. Mayor Sokolich tried to\nreach Baroni, leaving a message that the call was about an \u201curgent\nmatter of public safety.\u201dId.,at 323. Yet Baroni failed to\nreturn that call or any other: He had agreed with Wildstein and\nKelly that they should all maintain \u201cradio silence.\u201dId.,at\n270. A text from the Mayor to Baroni about the locked-in school\nbuses\u2014also unanswered\u2014went around the horn to Wildstein and Kelly.\nThe last replied: \u201cIs it wrong that I am smiling?\u201dId., at\n990 (Kelly text message). The three merrily kept the lane\nrealignment in place for another three days. It ended only when the\nPort Authority\u2019s Executive Director found out what had happened and\nreversed what he called their \u201cabusive decision.\u201dId., at\n963 (e-mail of Patrick Foye).The fallout from the scheme was swift and\nsevere. Baroni, Kelly, and Wildstein all lost their jobs. More to\nthe point here, they all ran afoul of federal prosecutors.\nWildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and agreed to\ncooperate with the Government. Baroni and Kelly went to trial on\ncharges of wire fraud, fraud on a federally funded program or\nentity (the Port Authority), and conspiracy to commit each of those\ncrimes. The jury found both of them guilty on all counts. The Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, rejecting Baroni\u2019s and\nKelly\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support their\nconvictions. SeeUnited Statesv.Baroni, 909 F.3d\n550, 560\u2013579 (2018). We granted certiorari. 588 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2019).IIThe Government in this case needed to provepropertyfraud. The federal wire fraud statute makes it a\ncrime to effect (with use of the wires) \u201cany scheme or artifice to\ndefraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or\nfraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71343. Construing that disjunctive language as a\nunitary whole, this Court has held that \u201cthe money-or- property\nrequirement of the latter phrase\u201d also limits the former.McNallyv.United States,483\nU.S. 350, 358 (1987). The wire fraud statute thus prohibits\nonly deceptive \u201cschemes to deprive [the victim of] money or\nproperty.\u201dId.,at 356. Similarly, the federal-program fraud\nstatute bars \u201cobtain[ing] by fraud\u201d the \u201cproperty\u201d (including\nmoney) of a federally funded program or entity like the Port\nAuthority. \u00a7666(a)(1)(A). So under either provision, the Government\nhad to show not only that Baroni and Kelly engaged in deception,\nbut that an \u201cobject of the[ir] fraud [was] \u2018property.\u2019\u00a0\u201dClevelandv.United States,531 U.S.\n12, 26 (2000).[1]That requirement, this Court has made clear,\nprevents these statutes from criminalizing all acts of dishonesty\nby state and local officials. Some decades ago, courts of appeals\noften construed the federal fraud laws to \u201cproscribe[\u00a0]\nschemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honest\nand impartial government.\u201dMcNally, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 355.\nThis Court declined to go along. The fraud statutes, we held inMcNally, were \u201climited in scope to the protection of\nproperty rights.\u201dId.,at 360. They did not authorize\nfederal prosecutors to \u201cset[\u00a0] standards of disclosure and\ngood government for local and state officials.\u201dIbid.Congress responded to that decision by enacting a law barring\nfraudulent schemes \u201cto deprive another of the intangible right of\nhonest services\u201d\u2014regardless of whether the scheme sought to divest\nthe victim of any property. \u00a71346. But the vagueness of that\nlanguage led this Court to adopt \u201ca limiting construction,\u201d\nconfining the statute to schemes involving bribes or kickbacks.Skillingv.United States,561\nU.S. 358, 405, 410 (2010). We specifically rejected a proposal\nto construe the statute as encompassing \u201cundisclosed self-dealing\nby a public official,\u201d even when he hid financial interests.Id.,at 409. The upshot is that federal fraud law leaves\nmuch public corruption to the States (or their electorates) to\nrectify. Cf. N.\u00a0J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:30\u20132 (West 2016)\n(prohibiting the unauthorized exercise of official functions). Save\nfor bribes or kickbacks (not at issue here), a state or local\nofficial\u2019s fraudulent schemes violate that law only when, again,\nthey are \u201cfor obtaining money or property.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a71343; see \u00a7666(a)(1)(A) (similar).The Government acknowledges this much, but\nthinks Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s convictions remain valid. According to\nthe Government\u2019s theory of the case, Baroni and Kelly \u201cused a lie\nabout a fictional traffic study\u201d to achieve their goal of\nreallocating the Bridge\u2019s toll lanes. Brief for United States 43.\nThe Government accepts that the lie itself\u2014i.e.,that the\nlane change was part of a traffic study, rather than political\npayback\u2014could not get the prosecution all the way home. Seeid.,at 43\u201344. As the Government recognizes, the deceit must\nalso have had the \u201cobject\u201d of obtaining the Port Authority\u2019s money\nor property.Id.,at 44. The scheme met that requirement,\nthe Government argues, in two ways. First, the Government claims\nthat Baroni and Kelly sought to \u201ccommandeer[\u00a0]\u201d part of the\nBridge itself\u2014to \u201ctake control\u201d of its \u201cphysical lanes.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 58\u201359. Second, the Government asserts that the two\ndefendants aimed to deprive the Port Authority of the costs of\ncompensating the traffic engineers and back-up toll collectors who\nperformed work relating to the lane realignment. On either theory,\nthe Government insists, Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s scheme targeted \u201ca\n\u2018species of valuable right [or] interest\u2019 that constitutes\n\u2018property\u2019 under the fraud statutes.\u201d Brief for United States 22\n(quotingPasquantinov.United States,544 U.S.\n349, 356 (2005)).We cannot agree. As we explain below, the\nGovernment could not have proved\u2014on either of its theories, though\nfor different reasons\u2014that Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s scheme was\n\u201cdirected at the [Port Authority\u2019s] property.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 44. Baroni and Kelly indeed \u201cplotted to reduce [Fort Lee\u2019s]\nlanes.\u201dId.,at 34. But that realignment was a\nquintessential exercise of regulatory power. And this Court has\nalready held that a scheme to alter such a regulatory choice is not\none to appropriate the government\u2019s property. SeeCleveland,\n531 U.\u00a0S., at 23. By contrast, a scheme to usurp a public\nemployee\u2019s paid time is one to take the government\u2019s property. But\nBaroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s plan never had that as an object. The use of\nPort Authority employees was incidental to\u2014the mere cost of\nimplementing\u2014the sought-after regulation of the Bridge\u2019s toll\nlanes.Start with this Court\u2019s decision inCleveland, which reversed another set of federal fraud\nconvictions based on the distinction between property and\nregulatory power. The defendant there had engaged in a deceptive\nscheme to influence, to his own benefit, Louisiana\u2019s issuance of\ngaming licenses. The Government argued that his fraud aimed to\ndeprive the State of property by altering its licensing decisions.\nThis Court rejected the claim. The State\u2019s \u201cintangible rights of\nallocation, exclusion, and control\u201d\u2014its prerogatives over who\nshould get a benefit and who should not\u2014do \u201cnot create a property\ninterest.\u201dIbid.Rather, the Court stated, those rights\n\u201camount to no more and no less than\u201d the State\u2019s \u201csovereign power\nto regulate.\u201dIbid.; seeid.,at 20 (\u201c[T]he State\u2019s\ncore concern\u201d in allocating gaming licenses \u201cisregulatory\u201d). Or said another way: The defendant\u2019s fraud\n\u201cimplicate[d] the Government\u2019s role as sovereign\u201d wielding\n\u201ctraditional police powers\u201d\u2014not its role \u201cas property holder.\u201dId.,at 23\u201324. And so his conduct, however deceitful, was\nnot property fraud.The same is true of the lane realignment.\nThrough that action, Baroni and Kelly changed the traffic flow onto\nthe George Washington Bridge\u2019s tollbooth plaza. Contrary to the\nGovernment\u2019s view, the two defendants did not \u201ccommandeer\u201d the\nBridge\u2019s access lanes (supposing that word bears its normal\nmeaning). They (of course) did not walk away with the lanes; nor\ndid they take the lanes from the Government by converting them to a\nnon-public use. Rather, Baroni and Kelly regulated use of the\nlanes, as officials responsible for roadways so often do\u2014allocating\nlanes as between different groups of drivers. To borrowCleveland\u2019s words, Baroni and Kelly exercised the regulatory\nrights of \u201callocation, exclusion, and control\u201d\u2014deciding that\ndrivers from Fort Lee should get two fewer lanes while drivers from\nnearby highways should get two more. They did so, according to all\nthe Government\u2019s evidence, for bad reasons; and they did so by\nresorting to lies. But still,whatthey did was alter a\nregulatory decision about the toll plaza\u2019s use\u2014in effect, about\nwhich drivers had a \u201clicense\u201d to use which lanes. And underCleveland, that run-of-the-mine exercise of regulatory power\ncannot count as the taking of property.A government\u2019s right to its employees\u2019 time and\nlabor, by contrast, can undergird a property fraud prosecution.\nSuppose that a mayor uses deception to get \u201con-the-clock city\nworkers\u201d to renovate his daughter\u2019s new home.United Statesv.Pabey, 664 F.3d 1084, 1089 (CA7 2011). Or imagine that a\ncity parks commissioner induces his employees into doing gardening\nwork for political contributors. SeeUnited Statesv.Delano,55 F.3d 720, 723 (CA2 1995). As both defendants agree, the cost\nof those employees\u2019 services would qualify as an economic loss to a\ncity, sufficient to meet the federal fraud statutes\u2019 property\nrequirement. See Brief for Respondent Baroni 27; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n16. No less than if the official took cash out of the city\u2019s bank\naccount would he have deprived the city of a \u201cvaluable\nentitlement.\u201dPasquantino, 544 U.\u00a0S., at 357.But that property must play more than some bit\npart in a scheme: It must be an \u201cobject of the fraud.\u201dId.,\nat 355; see Brief for United States 44;supra,at 6\u20137. Or\nput differently, a property fraud conviction cannot stand when the\nloss to the victim is only an incidental byproduct of the\nscheme.[2] In the\nhome-and-garden examples cited above, that constraint raised no\nproblem: The entire point of the fraudsters\u2019 plans was to obtain\nthe employees\u2019 services. But now consider the difficulty if the\nprosecution inClevelandhad raised a similar employee-labor\nargument. As the Government noted at oral argument here, the fraud\non Louisiana\u2019s licensing system doubtless imposed costs calculable\nin employee time: If nothing else, some state worker had to process\neach of the fraudster\u2019s falsified applications. But still, the\nGovernment acknowledged, those costs were \u201c[i]ncidental.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63. The object of the scheme was never to get the\nemployees\u2019 labor: It was to get gaming licenses. So the labor costs\ncould not sustain the conviction for property fraud. Seeid.,at 62\u201363.This case is no different. The time and labor of\nPort Authority employees were just the implementation costs of the\ndefendants\u2019 scheme to reallocate the Bridge\u2019s access lanes. Or said\nanother way, the labor costs were an incidental (even if foreseen)\nbyproduct of Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s regulatory object. Neither\ndefendant sought to obtain the services that the employees\nprovided. The back-up toll collectors\u2014whom Baroni joked would just\n\u201csit there and wait\u201d\u2014did nothing he or Kelly thought useful. App.\n303; seesupra,at 5. Indeed, those workers came onto the\nscene only because the Port Authority\u2019s chief engineer managed to\nrestore one of Fort Lee\u2019s lanes to reduce the risk of traffic\naccidents. Seesupra,at 5. In the defendants\u2019 original\nplan, which scrapped all reserved lanes, there was no reason for\nextra toll collectors. And similarly, Baroni and Kelly did not hope\nto obtain the data that the traffic engineers spent their time\ncollecting. By the Government\u2019s own account, the traffic study the\ndefendants used for a cover story was a \u201csham,\u201d and they never\nasked to see its results. Brief for United States 4, 32; seesupra,at 5. Maybe, as the Government contends, all of this\nwork was \u201cneeded\u201d to realize the final plan\u2014\u201cto accomplish what\n[Baroni and Kelly] were trying to do with the [B]ridge.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 60. Even if so, it would make no difference. Every\nregulatory decision (think again ofCleveland, seesupra,at 11) requires the use of some employee labor. But\nthat does not mean every scheme to alter a regulation has that\nlabor as its object. Baroni\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s plan aimed to impede\naccess from Fort Lee to the George Washington Bridge. The cost of\nthe employee hours spent on implementing that plan was its\nincidental byproduct.To rule otherwise would undercut this Court\u2019s\noft- repeated instruction: Federal prosecutors may not use property\nfraud statutes to \u201cset[\u00a0] standards of disclosure and good\ngovernment for local and state officials.\u201dMcNally, 483\nU.\u00a0S., at 360; seesupra,at 7. Much of governance\ninvolves (as it did here) regulatory choice. If U.\u00a0S.\nAttorneys could prosecute as property fraud every lie a state or\nlocal official tells in making such a decision, the result would\nbe\u2014asClevelandrecognized\u2014\u201ca sweeping expansion of federal\ncriminal jurisdiction.\u201d 531 U.\u00a0S., at 24. And if those\nprosecutors could end-runClevelandjust by pointing to the\nregulation\u2019s incidental costs, the same ballooning of federal power\nwould follow. In effect, the Federal Government could use the\ncriminal law to enforce (its view of\u00a0) integrity in broad\nswaths of state and local policymaking. The property fraud statutes\ndo not countenance that outcome. They do not \u201cproscribe[\u00a0]\nschemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honest\nand impartial government.\u201dMcNally, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 355;\nseesupra,at 7. They bar only schemes for obtaining\nproperty.IIIAs Kelly\u2019s own lawyer acknowledged, this case\ninvolves an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. For no reason\nother than political payback, Baroni and Kelly used deception to\nreduce Fort Lee\u2019s access lanes to the George Washington Bridge\u2014and\nthereby jeopardized the safety of the town\u2019s residents. But not\nevery corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime.\nBecause the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property,\nBaroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud\nor wire fraud laws. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.It is so ordered.Notes1The conspiracy verdicts\nraise no separate issue. None of the parties doubts that those\nconvictions stand or fall with the substantive offenses. If there\nwas property fraud here, there was also conspiracy to commit it.\nBut if not, not.2Without that rule, as\nJudge Easterbrook has elaborated, even a practical joke could be a\nfederal felony. SeeUnited Statesv.Walters, 997\nF.2d 1219, 1224 (CA7 1993). His example goes: \u201cA [e-mails] B an\ninvitation to a surprise party for their mutual friend C. B drives\nhis car to the place named in the invitation,\u201d thus expending the\ncost of gasoline.Ibid.\u201cBut there is no party; the address\nis a vacant lot; B is the butt of a joke.\u201dIbid.Wire fraud?\nNo. And for the reason Judge Easterbrook gave: \u201c[T]he victim\u2019s loss\nmust be an objective of the [deceitful] scheme rather than a\nbyproduct of it.\u201dId.,at 1226.",
