SACHSon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[December 1, 2015]Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court.The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shields\nforeign states and their agencies from suit in United States courts\nunless the suit falls within one of the Act\u2019s specifically\nenumerated exceptions. This case concerns the scope of the\ncommercial activity exception, which withdraws sovereign immunity\nin any case \u201cin which the action is based upon a commercial\nactivity carried on in the United States by [a] foreign state.\u201d 28\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(2).Respondent Carol Sachs is a resident of\nCaliforniawho purchased in the United States a Eurail pass forrail\ntravel in Europe. She suffered traumatic personal in-juries when\nshe fell onto the tracks at the Innsbruck, Austria, train station\nwhile attempting to board a train operated by the Austrian\nstate-owned railway. She sued the railway in Federal District\nCourt, arguing that her suit was not barred by sovereign immunity\nbecause it is \u201cbased upon\u201d the railway\u2019s sale of the pass to her in\nthe United States. We disagree and conclude that her action is\ninstead \u201cbased upon\u201d the railway\u2019s conduct in Innsbruck. We\ntherefore hold that her suit falls outside the commercial activity\nexception and is barred by sovereign immunity.IAPetitioner OBB Personenverkehr AG (OBB)\noperates a railway that carries nearly 235 million passengers each\nyear on routes within Austria and to and from points beyond\nAustria\u2019s frontiers. OBB is wholly owned by OBB Holding Group, a\njoint-stock company created by the Republic of Austria. OBB Holding\nGroup in turn is wholly owned by the Austrian Federal Ministry of\nTransport, Innovation, and Technology.Sachsv.Republic\nof Austria, 737 F.\u00a03d 584, 587 (CA9 2013).OBB\u2014along with 29 other railways throughout\nEurope\u2014is a member of the Eurail Group, an association responsible\nfor the marketing and management of the Eurail pass program. Brief\nfor International Rail Transport Committee asAmicus Curiae12; 737 F.\u00a03d, at 587. Eurail passes allow their holders\nunlimited passage for a set period of time on participating Eurail\nGroup railways. They are available only to non-Europeans, who may\npurchase them both directly from the Eurail Group and indirectly\nthrough a worldwide network of travel agents. Brief for\nInternational Rail Transport Committee asAmicus Curiae12\u201313, and n.\u00a03; Brief for Respondent4\u20135.Carol Sachs is a resident of Berkeley,\nCalifornia. In March 2007, she purchased a Eurail pass over the\nInternet from The Rail Pass Experts, a Massachusetts-based travel\nagent. The following month, Sachs arrived at the Innsbruck train\nstation, planning to use her Eurail pass to ride an OBB train to\nPrague. As she attempted to board the train, Sachs fell from the\nplatform onto the tracks. OBB\u2019s moving train crushed her legs, both\nof which had to be amputated above the knee. 737 F.\u00a03d, at\n587\u2013588.Sachs sued OBB in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, asserting five\ncauses of action: (1) negligence; (2) strict liability for design\ndefects in the train and platform; (3) strict liability for failure\nto warn of those design defects; (4) breach of an implied warranty\nof merchantability for providing a train and platform unsafe for\ntheir intended uses; and (5) breach of an implied warranty of\nfitness for providing a train and platform unfit for their intended\nuses. App. 14\u201318. OBB claimed sovereign immunity and moved to\ndismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 737\nF.\u00a03d, at 588.BThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \u201cprovides\nthe sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign statein\nthe courts of this country.\u201dArgentine Republicv.Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.\u00a0S. 428, 443 (1989)\n. The Act defines \u201cforeign state\u201d to include a state \u201cagency or\ninstrumentality,\u201d 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71603(a), and both parties\nagree that OBB qualifies as a \u201cforeign state\u201d for purposes of the\nAct. OBB is therefore \u201cpresumptively immune from the jurisdiction\nof United States courts\u201d unless one of the Act\u2019s express exceptions\nto sovereign immunity applies.Saudi Arabiav.Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 349, 355 (1993) . Sachs argues that\nher suit falls within the Act\u2019s commercial activity exception,\nwhich provides in part that a foreign state does not enjoy immunity\nwhen \u201cthe action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in\nthe United States by the foreign state.\u201d \u00a71605(a)(2).[1]The District Court concluded that Sachs\u2019s suit\ndid not fall within \u00a71605(a)(2) and therefore granted OBB\u2019s motion\nto dismiss. 2011 WL 816854, *1, *4 (ND Cal., Jan. 28, 2011). A\ndivided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 695 F.\u00a03d 1021 (2012). The full court\nordered rehearing en banc and, with three judges dissenting,\nreversed the panel decision. 737 F.\u00a03d 584.The en banc majority first observed that, \u201cbased\non the agreement of the parties,\u201d \u201cthe only relevant commercial\nactivity within the United States was [Sachs\u2019s] March 2007 purchase\nof a Eurail pass from the Rail Pass Experts,\u201d a Massachusetts\ncompany.Id.,at 591, n.\u00a04 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The court concluded that The Rail Pass Experts had acted\nas OBB\u2019s agent and, using common law principles of agency,\nattributed that Eurail pass sale to OBB.Id.,at\n591\u2013598.The court next asked whether Sachs\u2019s claims were\n\u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of the Eurail pass within the meaning of\n\u00a71605(a)(2). The \u201cbased upon\u201d determination, the court explained,\nrequires that the commercial activity within the United States be\n\u201cconnected with the conduct that gives rise to the plaintiff\u2019s\ncause of action.\u201dId.,at 590. But, the court\ncontinued, \u201cit is not necessary that the entire claim be based upon\nthe commercial activity of OBB.\u201dId.,at 599. Rather, in the\ncourt\u2019s view, Sachs would satisfy the \u201cbased upon\u201d requirement for\na particular claim \u201cifan elementof [that] claim consists\nin conduct that occurred in commercial activity carried on in the\nUnited States.\u201dIbid.(internal quotation marks\nomitted).Applying California law, seeid., at 600,\nn.\u00a014, the court analyzed Sachs\u2019s causes of action\nindividually and concluded that the sale of the Eurail pass\nestablished a necessary element of each of her claims. Turning\nfirst to the negligence claim, the court found that Sachs was\nrequired to show that OBB owed her a duty of care as a passenger as\none element of that claim. The court concluded that such a duty\narose from the sale of the Eurail pass.Id., at 600\u2013602.\nTurning next to the other claims, the court determined that the\nexistence of a \u201ctransaction between a seller and a consumer\u201d was a\nnecessary element of Sachs\u2019s strict liability and breach of implied\nwarranty claims.Id.,at 602. The sale of the Eurail pass,\nthe court noted, provided proof of such a transaction.Ibid.Having found that \u201cthe sale of the Eurail pass in the United States\nforms an essential element of each of Sachs\u2019s claims,\u201d the court\nconcluded that each claim was \u201cbased upon a commercial activity\ncarried on in the United States\u201d by OBB.Ibid.We granted certiorari. 574 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015).IIOBB contends that the sale of the Eurail pass\nis not attributable to the railway, reasoning that the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act does not allow attribution through\nprinciples found in the common law of agency. OBB also argues that\neven if such attribution were allowed under the Act, Sachs\u2019s suit\nis not \u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of the Eurail pass for purposes of\n\u00a71605(a)(2). We agree with OBB on the second point and therefore do\nnot reach the first.AThe Act itself does not elaborate on the\nphrase \u201cbased upon.\u201d Our decision inSaudi Arabiav.Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 349 , however, provides sufficient\nguidance to resolve this case. InNelson, a husband and wife\nbrought suit against Saudi Arabia and its state-owned hospital,\nseeking damages for intentional and negligent torts stemming from\nthe husband\u2019s allegedly wrongful arrest, imprisonment, and torture\nby Saudi police while he was employed at a hospital in Saudi\nArabia.Id., at 351, 353\u2013354. The Saudi defendants claimed\nsovereign immunity under the Act, arguing,inter alia, that\n\u00a71605(a)(2) was inapplicable because the suit was \u201cbased upon\u201d\nsovereign acts\u2014the exercise of Saudi police authority\u2014and not upon\ncommercial activity. See Brief for Petitioners inSaudi\nArabiav.Nelson, O. T. 1992, No. 91\u2013552, pp. 12\u201314. The\nNelsons countered that their suit was \u201cbased upon\u201d the defendants\u2019\ncommercial activities in \u201crecruit[ing] Scott Nelson for work at the\nhospital, sign[ing] an employment contract with him, and\nsubsequently employ[ing] him.\u201d 507 U.\u00a0S., at 358. We rejected\nthe Nelsons\u2019 arguments.The Act\u2019s \u201cbased upon\u201d inquiry, we reasoned,\nfirst requires a court to \u201cidentify[\u2005] the particular conduct on\nwhich the [plaintiff\u2019s] action is \u2018based.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at\n356. Considering dictionary definitions and lower court decisions,\nwe explained that a court should identify that \u201cparticular conduct\u201d\nby looking to the \u201cbasis\u201d or \u201cfoundation\u201d for a claim,id.,at 357 (citing dictionary definitions), \u201cthose elements\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. that, if proven, would entitle a plaintiff to\nrelief,\u201dibid., and \u201cthe \u2018gravamen of the complaint,\u2019\u00a0\u201dibid.(quotingCallejov.Bancomer,\nS.\u00a0A., 764 F.\u00a02d 1101, 1109 (CA5 1985)). Under that\nanalysis, we found that the commercial activities, while they \u201cled\nto the conduct that eventually injured the Nelsons,\u201d were not the\nparticular conduct upon which their suit was based. The suit was\ninstead based upon the Saudi sovereign acts that actually injured\nthem. 507 U.\u00a0S., at 358. The Nelsons\u2019 suit therefore did not\nfit within \u00a71605(a)(2).Id., at 361\u2013362.BThe Ninth Circuit held that Sachs\u2019s claims\nwere \u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of the Eurail pass because the sale of\nthe pass provided \u201can element\u201d of each of her claims. 737\nF.\u00a03d, at 599. UnderNelson, however, the mere fact\nthat the sale of the Eurail pass would establish a single element\nof a claim is insufficient to demonstrate that the claim is \u201cbased\nupon\u201d that sale for purposes of \u00a71605(a)(2).The Ninth Circuit apparently derived its\none-element test from an overreading of one part of one sentence inNelson, in which we observed that \u201cthe phrase [\u2018based upon\u2019]\nis read most naturally to mean those elements of a claim that, if\nproven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the\ncase.\u201d 507 U.\u00a0S., at 357. We do not see how that mention of\nelements\u2014plural\u2014could be considered an endorsement of aone-element test, nor how the particular element the Ninth\nCircuit singled out for each of Sachs\u2019s claims could be construed\nto entitle her to relief.Be that as it may, our analysis inNelsonis flatly incompatible with a one-element approach. A one-element\ntest necessarily requires a court to identifyallthe\nelementsof each claim in a complaint before that court may re-ject\nthose claims for falling outside \u00a71605(a)(2). But we did not\nundertake such an exhaustive claim-by-claim, element-by-element\nanalysis of the Nelsons\u2019 16 causes of action, nor did we engage in\nthe choice-of-law analysis that would have been a necessary prelude\nto such an undertaking. Compareid., at 356\u2013358, with 737\nF.\u00a03d, at 600, n.\u00a014 (noting disagreement over whether\nstate or federal common law principles govern suits under the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act).Nelsoninstead teaches that an action is\n\u201cbased upon\u201d the \u201cparticular conduct\u201d that constitutes the\n\u201cgravamen\u201d of the suit. Rather than individually analyzing each of\nthe Nelsons\u2019 causes of action, we zeroed in on the core of their\nsuit: the Saudi sovereign acts that actually injured them. As the\nCourt explained:\u201cEven taking each of the Nelsons\u2019\nallegations about Scott Nelson\u2019s recruitment and employment as\ntrue, those facts alone entitle the Nelsons to nothing under their\ntheory of the case. The Nelsons have .\u00a0.\u00a0. alleged\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. personal injuries caused by [the defendants\u2019]\nintentional wrongs and by [the defendants\u2019] negligent failure to\nwarn Scott Nelson that they might commit those wrongs. Those torts,\nand not the arguably commercial activities that preceded their\ncommission, form the basis for the Nelsons\u2019 suit.\u201d 507\nU.\u00a0S.,at 358.Under this analysis, the conduct constituting\nthe gravamen of Sachs\u2019s suit plainly occurred abroad. All of her\nclaims turn on the same tragic episode in Austria, alleg-edly\ncaused by wrongful conduct and dangerous conditions in Austria,\nwhich led to injuries suffered in Austria.Sachs maintains that some of those claims are\nnot limited to negligent conduct or unsafe conditions in Austria,\nbut rather involve at least some wrongful action in the United\nStates. Her strict liability claim for failure to warn, for\nexample, alleges that OBB should have alerted her to the dangerous\nconditions at the Innsbruck train station when OBB sold the Eurail\npass to herin the United States. Under any theory of the\ncase that Sachs pre-sents, however, there is nothing wrongful about\nthe sale of the Eurail pass standing alone. Without the existence\nof the unsafe boarding conditions in Innsbruck, there would have\nbeen nothing to warn Sachs about when she bought the Eurail pass.\nHowever Sachs frames her suit, the incident in Innsbruck remains at\nits foundation.As we explained inNelson, any other\napproach would allow plaintiffs to evade the Act\u2019s restrictions\nthrough artful pleading. For example, any plaintiff \u201ccould recast\nvirtually any claim of intentional tort .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a claim\nof failure to warn, simply by charging the defendant with an\nobligation to announce its own tortious propensity before indulging\nit.\u201dId.,at 363. To allow such \u201crecast[ing]\u201d of a\ncomplaint, we reasoned, would \u201cgive jurisdictional significance to\n[a] feint of language,\u201d thereby \u201ceffectively thwart[ing] the Act\u2019s\nmanifest purpose.\u201dIbid.A century ago, in a letter to then-Professor\nFrankfurter, Justice Holmes wrote that the \u201cessentials\u201d of a\npersonal injury narrative will be found at the \u201cpoint of\ncontact\u201d\u2014\u201cthe place where the boy got his fingers pinched.\u201d Letter\n(Dec. 19, 1915), in Holmes and Frankfurter: Their Correspondence,\n1912\u20131934, p. 40 (R. Mennel & C. Compston eds. 1996). At least\nin this case, that insight holds true. Regardless of whether Sachs\nseeks relief under claims for negligence, strict liability for\nfailure to warn, or breach of implied warranty, the \u201cessentials\u201d of\nher suit for purposes of \u00a71605(a)(2) are found in Austria.[2]IIISachs raises a new argument in this Court in\nan attempt to fit her claims within \u00a71605(a)(2). In addition to\narguing that her claims are \u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of the Eurail\npass, she now contends that her suit is \u201cbased upon\u201d \u201cOBB\u2019s overall\ncommercial railway enterprise.\u201d Brief for Respondent 24; see also\nTr. of Oral Arg. 38.\u201c[C]ommercial activity carried on in the United\nStates by the foreign state,\u201d as used in \u00a71605(a)(2), is defined to\nmean \u201ccommercial activity carried on by such state and having\nsubstantial contact with the United States.\u201d \u00a71603(e). Sachs\u2019s new\ntheory is that OBB\u2019sentirerailway enterprise constitutes\nthe \u201ccommercial activity\u201d that has the requisite \u201csubstantial\ncontact with the United States,\u201d because OBB reaches out to\nAmerican customers by marketing and selling Eurail passes in the\nUnited States.That argument was never presented to any lower\ncourt and is therefore forfeited. Sachs argued in the courts below\nonly that her claims were \u201cbased upon\u201d the sale of the Eurail pass,\nand the lower courts resolved the case on that understanding. See,e.g., 737 F.\u00a03d, at 591, n.\u00a04 (\u201cThe district court\nconcluded, based on the agreement of the parties, that \u2018the only\nrelevant commercial activity within the United States was\nplaintiff\u2019s March 2007 purchase of a Eurail Pass from the Rail Pass\nExperts.\u2019 We consider only the relevant conduct as defined by the\ndistrict court.\u201d).[3] Indeed,\nwhen we granted certiorari, the relevant question presented for our\nreview was whether Sachs\u2019s claims were \u201cbased upon\u201d the \u201csale of\nthe ticket in the United States.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i; accord, Brief\nfor Respondent i. We have answered that question in the negative.\nAbsent unusual circumstances\u2014none of which is present here\u2014we will\nnot entertain arguments not made below.Taylorv.Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.\u00a0S. 638 \u2013646 (1992).We therefore conclude that Sachs has failed to\ndemonstrate that her suit falls within the commercial activity\nexception in \u00a71605(a)(2). OBB has sovereign immunity under the Act,\nand accordingly the courts of the United States lack jurisdiction\nover the suit.The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Notes1Section 1605(a)(2)\ncontains three separate clauses. In full, the section\nprovides:2We cautioned inNelsonthat the reach of our decision was limited, seeSaudi Arabiav.Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 349 ,\nn.\u00a04 (1993), and similar caution is warranted here. Domestic\nconduct with respect to different types of commercial activity may\nplay a more significant role in other suits under the first clause\nof \u00a71605(a)(2). In addition, we consider here only a case in which\nthe gravamen of each claim is found in the same place.3See also Points and\nAuthorities in Opposition to OBB Personenverkehr AG\u2019s Motion to\nDismiss in No. 08\u201301840 (ND Cal.), p.\u00a08 (\u201cThe claims herein\nare based on the purchase of the Eurail pass.\u201d); Appellant\u2019s\nOpening Brief in No. 11\u201315458 (CA9), p.\u00a010 (\u201c[T]he claims are\n\u2018based upon\u2019 the purchase of the ticket which occurred in the\nUnited States.\u201d); Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief in No. 11\u201315458 (CA9),\np.\u00a08 (\u201c[H]er claim was based on the purchase/sale of the\nticket.\u201d). The District Court decided the case on that\nunderstanding of Sachs\u2019s argument. See 2011 WL 816854, *2 (ND Cal.,\nJan. 28, 2011); see also 2010 WL 4916394, *1 (ND Cal., Nov. 22,\n2010). As did the Ninth Circuit panel, see 695 F.\u00a03d 1021,\n1024 (2012), and, as noted, the Ninth Circuit en banc. When OBB\npetitioned this Court for writ of certiorari, Sachs\u2019s brief in\nopposition repeated her earlier arguments. See Brief in Opposition\n2; see also this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2.",
