We conclude that it\ndoes.IIn the early hours of July 27, 2015, two\npeople burgled the Tongue & Cheek restaurant in Miami Beach,\nFlorida. Petitioner Denard Stokeling was an employee of the\nrestaurant, and the Miami Beach Police identified him as a suspect\nbased on surveillance video from the burglary and witness\nstatements. After conducting a criminal background check, police\nlearned that Stokeling had previously been convicted of three\nfelonies\u2014home invasion, kidnaping, and robbery. When confronted,\nStokeling admitted that he had a gun in his backpack. The\ndetectives opened the backpack and discovered a 9-mm semiautomatic\nfirearm, a magazine, and 12 rounds of ammunition.Stokeling pleaded guilty in federal court to\npossessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of\na felony, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1). The\nprobation office recommended that Stokeling be sentenced as an\narmed career criminal under ACCA, which provides that a person who\nviolates \u00a7922(g) and who has three previous convictions for a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years.\n\u00a7924(e). ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that\u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of another;\nor\u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves\nuse of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B).As relevant here, Stokeling objected that his\n1997 Florida robbery conviction was not a predicate offense under\nACCA. This conviction, he argued, did not qualify under the first\nclause\u2014the \u201celements clause\u201d\u2014because Florida robbery does not have\n\u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force.\u201d\u00a0[1]*Under Florida law, robbery is defined as \u201cthe\ntaking of money or other property .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the person\nor custody of another, .\u00a0.\u00a0. when in the course of the\ntaking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in\nfear.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1) (1995). The Florida Supreme Court has\nexplained that the \u201cuse of force\u201d necessary to commit robbery\nrequires \u201cresistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical\nforce of the offender.\u201dRobinsonv.State, 692\nSo.\u00a02d 883, 886 (1997).Instead of applying a categorical approach to\nthe elements clause, the District Court evaluated whether the facts\nof Stokeling\u2019s robbery conviction were serious enough to warrant an\nenhancement. The court concluded that, although Stokeling\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018grabbed [the victim] by the neck and tried to remove her\nnecklaces\u2019\u00a0\u201d as she \u201c\u00a0\u2018held onto\u2019\u00a0\u201d them, his\nactions did not \u201cjustify an enhancement.\u201d Sentencing Hearing in\n15\u2013cv\u201320815 (SD Fla.), Doc. 45, pp. 10\u201311. The court then sentenced\nStokeling to less than half of the mandatory minimum 15-year term\nof imprisonment provided by ACCA.The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 684 Fed. Appx.\n870 (2017). It held that the District Court erred in making its own\nfactual determination about the level of violence involved in\nStokeling\u2019s particular robbery offense.Id.,at 871. The\ncourt also rejected Stokeling\u2019s argument that Florida robbery does\nnot categorically require sufficient force to constitute a violent\nfelony under ACCA\u2019s elements clause.Id.,at 871\u2013872.We granted certiorari to address whether the\n\u201cforce\u201d required to commit robbery under Florida law qualifies as\n\u201cphysical force\u201d for purposes of the elements clause. 584\nU.\u00a0S. ___ (2018). We now affirm.IIConstruing the language of the elements clause\nin light of the history of ACCA and our opinion inJohnsonv.United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133 (2010), we conclude\nthat the elements clause encompasses robbery offenses that require\nthe criminal to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance.AAs originally enacted, ACCA prescribed a\n15-year minimum sentence for any person who received, possessed, or\ntransported a firearm following three prior convictions \u201cfor\nrobbery or burglary.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1982\ned., Supp. II). Robbery was defined in relevant part as \u201cany felony\nconsisting of the taking of the property of another from the person\nor presence of anotherby force or violence.\u201d \u00a71202(c)(8)\n(1982 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).The statute\u2019s definition mirrored the elements\nof the common-law crime of robbery, which has long required force\nor violence. At common law, an unlawful taking was merely larceny\nunless the crime involved \u201cviolence.\u201d 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law\n\u00a71156, p. 860 (J. Zane & C. Zollman eds., 9th ed. 1923). And\n\u201cviolence\u201d was \u201ccommitted if sufficient force [was] exerted to\novercome the resistance encountered.\u201dId.,at 861.A few examples illustrate the point. Under the\ncommon law, it was robbery \u201cto seize another\u2019s watch or purse, and\nuse sufficient force to break a chain or guard by which it is\nattached to his person, or to run against another, or rudely push\nhim about, for the purpose of diverting his attention and robbing\nhim.\u201d W. Clark & W. Marshall, Law of Crimes 554 (H. Lazell ed.,\n2d ed. 1905) (Clark & Marshall) (footnotes omitted). Similarly,\nit was robbery to pull a diamond pin out of a woman\u2019s hair when\ndoing so tore away hair attached to the pin. See 2 W. Russell,\nCrimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 68 (2d ed. 1828). But the crime\nwas larceny, not robbery, if the thief did not have to overcome\nsuch resistance.In fact, common-law authorities frequently used\nthe terms \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cforce\u201d interchangeably. Seeibid.(concluding that \u201cif any injury be done to the person, or there be\nany struggle by the party to keep possession of the property before\nit be taken from him, there will be a sufficient actual\n\u2018violence\u2019\u00a0\u201d to establish robbery); Clark & Marshall 553\n(\u201cSufficientforcemust be used to overcome\nresistance.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If there is any injury to the\nperson of the owner, or if he resists the attempt to rob him, and\nhis resistance is overcome, there is sufficientviolenceto\nmake the taking robbery, however slight the resistance\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). The common law also did not distinguish between gradations\nof \u201cviolence.\u201d If an act physically overcame a victim\u2019s resistance,\n\u201chowever slight\u201d that resistance might be, it necessarily\nconstituted violence.Ibid.; 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 242 (1769) (distinguishing \u201ctaking\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. by force\u201d from \u201cprivately stealing,\u201d and stating\nthat the use of this \u201cviolence\u201d differentiates robbery from other\nlarcenies); see also 3id.,at 120 (explaining, in the\nbattery context, that \u201cthe law cannot draw the line between\ndifferent degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the\nfirst and lowest stage of it\u201d).The overlap between \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d at\ncommon law is reflected in modern legal and colloquial usage of\nthese terms. \u201cForce\u201d means \u201c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed\nagainst a person or thing,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed.\n1999), or \u201cunlawful violence threatened or committed against\npersons or property,\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 748 (2d ed. 1987). Likewise, \u201cviolence\u201d implies force,\nincluding an \u201cunjust or unwarranted use of force.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary, at 1564; accord, Random House Dictionary, at 2124\n(\u201crough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment,\u201d or \u201can\nunjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights\nor laws\u201d).Against this background, Congress, in the\noriginal ACCA, defined robbery as requiring the use of \u201cforce or\nviolence\u201d\u2014a clear reference to the common law of robbery. SeeSamantarv.Yousuf, 560 U.\u00a0S. 305, 320,\nn.\u00a013 (2010) (\u201cCongress \u2018is understood to legislate against a\nbackground of common-law .\u00a0.\u00a0. principles\u2019\u00a0\u201d). And\nthe level of \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d needed at common law was by this\ntime well established: \u201cSufficient force must be used to overcome\nresistance .\u00a0.\u00a0. however slight the resistance.\u201d Clark\n& Marshall 553.In 1986, Congress amended the relevant\nprovisions of ACCA to their current form. The amendment was titled\nExpansion of Predicate Offenses for Armed Career Criminal\nPenalties. See Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402,\n100Stat. 3207\u201339. This amendment replaced the two enumerated crimes\nof \u201crobbery or burglary\u201d with the current elements clause, a new\nenumerated-offenses list, and a (now-defunct) residual clause. SeeJohnsonv.United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\nIn the new statute, robbery was no longer enumerated as a predicate\noffense. But the newly created elements clause extended ACCA to\ncoveranyoffense that has as an element \u201cthe use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physicalforce.\u201d 18\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (2012 ed.) (emphasis\nadded).\u201c\u00a0\u2018[I]f a word is obviously transplanted\nfrom another legal source, whether the common law or other\nlegislation, it brings the old soil with it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHallv.Hall, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947)). That principle supports our\ninterpretation of the term \u201cforce\u201d here. By retaining the term\n\u201cforce\u201d in the 1986 version of ACCA and otherwise \u201c[e]xpan[ding]\u201d\nthe predicate offenses under ACCA, Congress made clear that the\n\u201cforce\u201d required for common-law robbery would be sufficient to\njustify an enhanced sentence under the new elements clause. We can\nthink of no reason to read \u201cforce\u201d in the revised statute to\nrequire anything more than the degree of \u201cforce\u201d required in the\n1984 statute. And it would be anomalous to read \u201cforce\u201d asexcludingthe quintessential ACCA-predicate crime of\nrobbery, despite the amendment\u2019s retention of the term \u201cforce\u201d and\nits stated intent to expand the number of qualifying offenses.The symmetry between the 1984 definition of\nrobbery (requiring the use of \u201cforce or violence\u201d) and the 1986\nelements clause (requiring the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d) is\nstriking. By replacing robbery as an enumerated offense with a\nclause that has \u201cforce\u201d as its touchstone, Congress made clear that\n\u201cforce\u201d retained the same common-law definition that undergirded\nthe original definition of robbery adopted a mere two years\nearlier. That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the\noriginal 1984 statute defined \u201crobbery\u201d using terms with\nwell-established common-law meanings.Our understanding of \u201cphysical force\u201d is further\nbuttressed by the then widely accepted definitions of robbery in\nthe States. In 1986, a significant majority of the States defined\nnonaggravated robbery as requiring force that overcomes a victim\u2019s\nresistance. The Government counts 43 States that measured force by\nthis degree, 5 States that required \u201cforce\u201d to cause bodily injury,\nand 2 States and the District of Columbia that permitted force to\nencompass something less, such as purse snatching. App. B to Brief\nfor United States. Stokeling counters that, at most, 31 States\ndefined force as overcoming victim resistance. Reply Brief 21. We\nneed not declare a winner in this numbers game because, either way,\nit is clear that many States\u2019 robbery statutes would not qualify as\nACCA predicates under Stokeling\u2019s reading.His reading would disqualify more than just\nbasic-robbery statutes. Departing from the common-law understanding\nof \u201cforce\u201d would also exclude other crimes that have as an element\nthe force required to commit basic robbery. For instance, Florida\nrequires the same element of \u201cforce\u201d for both armed robbery and\nbasic robbery. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(2)(a) (distinguishing armed\nrobbery from robbery by requiring the additional element of\n\u201ccarr[ying] a firearm or other deadly weapon\u201d during the robbery).\nThus, as Stokeling\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument, \u201carmed\nrobbery in Florida\u201d would not qualify under ACCA if his view were\nadopted. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\u20134; seeUnited Statesv.Lee, 886 F.\u00a03d 1161, 1163, n. 1 (CA11 2018) (treating\n\u201cFlorida strong-arm robbery [i.e.,basic robbery], armed\nrobbery, and attempted robbery .\u00a0.\u00a0. the same for\npurposes of analyzing the ACCA\u2019s elements clause\u201d).Where, as here, the applicability of a federal\ncriminal statute requires a state conviction, we have repeatedly\ndeclined to construe the statute in a way that would render it\ninapplicable in many States. See,e.g.,United Statesv.Castleman, 572 U.\u00a0S. 157, 167 (2014) (reading\n\u201cphysical force\u201d to include common-law force, in part because a\ndifferent reading would render 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9)\n\u201cineffectual in at least 10 States\u201d);Voisinev.United\nStates, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9)\n(declining to interpret \u00a7912(a)(33)(A) in a way that would \u201crisk\nrendering \u00a7922(g)(9) broadly inoperative\u201d in 34 States and the\nDistrict of Columbia). That approach is appropriate here as\nwell.BOur understanding of \u201cphysical force\u201d comports\nwithJohnsonv.United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133\n(2010). There, the Court held that \u201c\u00a0\u2018actua[l] and\nintentiona[l] touching\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014the level of force necessary to\ncommit common-law misdemeanor battery\u2014did not require the \u201cdegree\nof force\u201d necessary to qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA\u2019s\nelements clause.Id., at 138, 140. To reach this conclusion,\nthe Court parsed the meaning of the phrase \u201cphysical force.\u201d First,\nit explained that the modifier \u201cphysical\u201d \u201cplainly refers to force\nexerted by and through concrete bodies\u2014distinguishing physical\nforce, from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.\u201dId.,at 138. The Court then considered \u201cwhether the term\n\u2018force\u2019 in [the elements clause] has the specialized meaning that\nit bore in the common-law definition of battery.\u201dId., at\n139. After reviewing the context of the statute, the Court rejected\nthe Government\u2019s suggestion that \u201cforce\u201d encompassed even the\n\u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201dIbid.Instead, it held that\n\u201cphysical force\u201d means \u201cviolentforce\u2014that is, force capable\nof causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201dId.,at 140. Applying that standard to a Florida battery law\ncriminalizing \u201canyintentional physical contact,\u201d the Court\nconcluded that the law did not require the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d\nwithin the meaning of ACCA.Ibid.Stokeling argues thatJohnsonrejected as\ninsufficient the degree of \u201cforce\u201d required to commit robbery under\nFlorida law because it is not \u201csubstantial force.\u201d We dis-agree.\nThe nominal contact thatJohnsonaddressed in- volved\nphysical force that is different in kind from the violent force\nnecessary to overcome resistance by a victim. The force necessary\nfor misdemeanor battery does not require resistance or even\nphysical aversion on the part of the victim; the \u201cunwanted\u201d nature\nof the physical contact itself suffices to render it unlawful. SeeStatev.Hearns, 961 So.\u00a02d 211, 216 (Fla.\n2007).By contrast, the force necessary to overcome a\nvictim\u2019s physical resistance is inherently \u201cviolent\u201d in the sense\ncontemplated byJohnson, and \u201csuggest[s] a degree of power\nthat would not be satisfied by the merest touching.\u201d 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 139. This is true because robbery that must\noverpower a victim\u2019s will\u2014even a feeble or weak-willed\nvictim\u2014necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle.\nThe altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged;\nit is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that\nis itself \u201ccapable of causing physical pain or injury.\u201dId.,at 140. Indeed,Johnsonitself relied on a definition of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d that specifically encompassed robbery:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[f]orce consisting in a physical act,esp. a violent act\ndirected against a robbery victim.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId.,at 139\n(quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009); emphasis\nadded). Robbery thus has always been within the \u201c\u00a0\u2018category of\nviolent, active crimes\u2019\u00a0\u201d that Congress included in ACCA. 559\nU.\u00a0S., at 140.To get aroundJohnson, Stokeling cherry\npicks adjectives from parenthetical definitions in the opinion,\ninsisting that the level of force must be \u201csevere,\u201d \u201cextreme,\u201d\n\u201cfurious,\u201d or \u201cvehement.\u201d These adjectives cannot bear the weight\nStokeling would place on them. They merely supportedJohnson\u2019s actual holding: that common-law battery does not\nrequire \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury.\u201dIbid.Johnsondid not purport to establish a force\nthreshold so high as to exclude even robbery from ACCA\u2019s scope.\nMoreover, Stokeling ignores that the Court also defined \u201cviolence\u201d\nas \u201c\u00a0\u2018unjust or improperforce.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). As explained above, the common law similarly\nlinked the terms \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cforce.\u201d Overcoming a victim\u2019s\nresistance wasper\u00a0seviolence against the victim, even\nif it ultimately caused minimal pain or injury. See Russell, Crimes\nand Indictable Misdemeanors, at 68.CIn the wake ofJohnson, the Court has\nrepeated its holding that \u201cphysical force\u201d means \u201c\u00a0\u2018force\ncapable of causing physical pain or injury.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSessionsv.Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at\n19\u201320) (quotingJohnson,supra, at 140); see alsoCastleman,supra, at 173\u2013174 (Scalia, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).Finding this definition difficult to square with\nhis position, Stokeling urges us to adopt a new, heightened reading\nof physical force: force that is \u201creasonably expected to cause pain\nor injury.\u201d For the reasons already explained, that definition is\ninconsistent with the degree of force necessary to commit robbery\nat common law. Moreover, the Court declined to adopt that standard\ninJohnson, even after considering similar language employed\nin a nearby statutory provision, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii). 559 U.\u00a0S., at 143. The Court instead\nsettled on \u201cforcecapableof causing physical pain or\ninjury.\u201dId., at 140 (emphasis added). \u201cCapable\u201d means\n\u201csusceptible\u201d or \u201chaving attributes .\u00a0.\u00a0. required for\nperformance or accomplishment\u201d or \u201chaving traits conducive to or\nfeatures permitting.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 203\n(1983); see also Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus 180 (2d\ned. 2009) (\u201chaving the ability or quality necessary to do\u201d).Johnsonthus does not require any particular degree of\nlikelihood or probability that the force used will cause physical\npain or injury; only potentiality.Stokeling\u2019s proposed standard would also prove\nexceedingly difficult to apply. Evaluating the statistical\nprobability that harm will befall a victim is not an administrable\nstandard under our categorical approach. Crimes can be committed in\nmany different ways, and it would be difficult to assess whether a\ncrime is categorically likely to harm the victim, especially when\nthe statute at issue lacks fine-tuned gradations of \u201cforce.\u201d We\ndecline to impose yet another indeterminable line-drawing exercise\non the lower courts.Stokeling next contends thatCastlemanheld that minor uses of force do not constitute \u201cviolent force,\u201d\nbut he misreads that opinion. InCastleman, the Court noted\nthat for purposes of a statute focused on domestic-violence\nmisdemeanors, crimes involving relatively \u201cminor uses of force\u201d\nthat might not \u201cconstitute \u2018violence\u2019 in the generic sense\u201d could\nnevertheless qualify as predicate offenses. 572 U.\u00a0S., at 165.\nThe Court thus had no need to decide more generally whether, underJohnson, conduct that leads to relatively minor forms of\ninjury\u2014such as \u201ca cut, abrasion, [or] bruise\u201d\u2014\u201cnecessitate[s]\u201d the\nuse of \u201cviolent force.\u201d 572 U.\u00a0S., at 170. Only Justice\nScalia\u2019s separate opinion addressed that question, and he concluded\nthat force as small as \u201chitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing,\npinching, biting, and hair pulling,\u201did., at 182\n(alterations omitted), satisfiedJohnson\u2019s definition. He\nreasoned that \u201c[n]one of those actions bears any real resemblance\nto mere offensive touching, and all of them are capable of causing\nphysical pain or injury.\u201d 572 U.\u00a0S., at 182. This\nunderstanding of \u201cphysical force\u201d is consistent with our holding\ntoday that force is \u201ccapable of causing physical injury\u201d within the\nmeaning ofJohnsonwhen it is sufficient to overcome a\nvictim\u2019s resistance. Such force satisfies ACCA\u2019s elements\nclause.IIIWe now apply these principles to Florida\u2019s\nrobbery statute to determine whether it \u201chas as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another.\u201d 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). We\nconclude that it does.As explained, Florida law defines robbery as\n\u201cthe taking of money or other property .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the\nperson or custody of another, .\u00a0.\u00a0. when in the course of\nthe taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting\nin fear.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1). The Florida Supreme Court has made\nclear that this statute requires \u201cresistance by the victim that is\novercome by the physical force of the offender.\u201dRobinsonv.State, 692 So.\u00a02d 883, 886 (1997). Mere \u201csnatching of\nproperty from another\u201d will not suffice.Ibid.Several cases cited by the parties illustrate\nthe application of the standard articulated inRobinson. For\nexample, a defendant who grabs the victim\u2019s fingers and peels them\nback to steal money commits robbery in Florida.Sandersv.State, 769 So.\u00a02d 506, 507\u2013508 (Fla. App. 2000). But a\ndefendant who merely snatches money from the victim\u2019s hand and runs\naway has not committed robbery.Goldsmithv.State,\n573 So.\u00a02d 445 (Fla. App. 1991). Similarly, a defendant who\nsteals a gold chain does not use \u201c\u00a0\u2018force,\u2019 within the meaning\nof the robbery statute,\u201d simply because the victim \u201cfe[els] his\nfingers on the back of her neck.\u201dWalkerv.State,\n546 So.\u00a02d 1165, 1166\u20131167 (Fla. App. 1989). It is worth\nnoting that, in 1999, Florida enacted a separate \u201csudden snatching\u201d\nstatute that proscribes this latter category of conduct; under that\nstatute, it is unnecessary to show either that the defendant \u201cused\nany amount of force beyond that effort necessary to obtain\npossession of the money or other property\u201d or that \u201c[t]here was any\nresistance by the victim to the offender.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.131\n(1999).Thus, the application of the categorical\napproach to the Florida robbery statute is straightforward. Because\nthe term \u201cphysical force\u201d in ACCA encompasses the degree of force\nnecessary to commit common-law robbery, and because Florida robbery\nrequires that same degree of \u201cforce,\u201d Florida robbery qualifies as\nan ACCA-predicate offense under the elements clause. Cf.Descampsv.United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. 254, 261\n(2013) (\u201cIf the relevant statute has the same elemen[t],\u201d \u201cthen the\nprior conviction can serve as an ACCA predicate\u201d).IVIn sum, \u201cphysical force,\u201d or \u201cforce capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury,\u201dJohnson, 559 U.\u00a0S.,\nat 140, includes the amount of force necessary to overcome a\nvictim\u2019s resistance. Robbery under Florida law corresponds to that\nlevel of force and therefore qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under\nACCA\u2019s elements clause. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment\nof the Eleventh Circuit.It is so ordered.Notes1*\u00a0The Government did not\nargue that Florida robbery should qualify under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii),\npresumably because robbery is not among the enumerated offenses and\nthe Court held the \u201cresidual clause\u201d unconstitutionally vague inJohnsonv.United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015).",
