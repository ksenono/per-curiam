We have said that the\nstatutory phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d warrants a\n\u201cbroad interpretation,\u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\n& Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006) , though not so\nbroad as to reach any \u201ccommon-law fraud that happens to\ninvolve securities,\u201d see SECv. Zandford, 535 U. S. 813, 820\n(2002) . Considered in isolation, however, that phrase \u201cis\nessentially \u2018indeterminat[e]\u2019 because connections, like\nrelations, \u2018stop nowhere.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Maracich v.\nSpears, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). The phrase thus \u201cprovides\nlittle guidance without a limiting principle consistent with the\nstructure of the statute and its other provisions.\u201d Ibid. As\nI understand it, the opinion of the Court resolves this case by\napplying a limiting principle to the phrase \u201cin connection\nwith\u201d that is \u201cconsistent with the statutory framework\nand design\u201d of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards\nAct of 1998, id., at ___ (slip op., at 10), and also consistent\nwith our precedents.",
