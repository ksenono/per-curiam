S. ____ (2009)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-1372HAWAII, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.OFFICE\nOF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nhawaii[March 31, 2009]Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court.This case presents the question\nwhether Congress stripped the State of Hawaii of its authority to\nalienate its sovereign territory by passing a joint resolution to\napologize for the role that the United States played in\noverthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy in the late 19th century.\nRelying on Congress\u2019 joint resolution, the Supreme Court of Hawaii\npermanently enjoined the State from alienating certain of its\nlands, pending resolution of native Hawaiians\u2019 land claims that the\ncourt described as \u201cunrelinquished.\u201d We reverse.IAIn 1893, \u201c[a] so-called Committee\nof Safety, a group of professionals and businessmen, with the\nactive assistance of John Stevens, the United States Minister to\nHawaii, acting with the United States Armed Forces, replaced the\n[Hawaiian] monarchy with a provisional government.\u201dRicev.Cayetano,528 U. S. 495, 504\u2013505\n(2000). \u201cThat government sought annexation by the United States,\u201did., at 505, which the United States granted, see Joint\nResolution to Provide for Annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the\nUnited States, No. 55, 30 Stat. 750 (hereinafter Newlands\nResolution). Pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the Republic of\nHawaii \u201ccede[d] absolutely and without reserve to the United States\nof America all rights of sovereignty of whatsoever kind\u201d and\nfurther \u201ccede[d] and transfer[red] to the United States the\nabsolute fee and ownership of all public, Government, or Crown\nlands, public buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and\ndescription belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian Islands,\ntogether with every right and appurtenance thereunto appertaining\u201d\n(hereinafter ceded lands).[Footnote\n1]Ibid.The Newlands Resolution further provided that\nall \u201cproperty and rights\u201d in the ceded lands \u201care vested in the\nUnited States of America.\u201dIbid.Two years later, Congress\nestablished a government for the Territory of Hawaii. See Act of\nApr. 30, 1900, ch. 339, 31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act). The\nOrganic Act reiterated the Newlands Resolution and made clear that\nthe new Territory consisted of the land that the United States\nacquired in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d under that resolution. See \u00a72,\nibid.The Organic Act further provided:\u201c[T]he portion of the public domain heretofore\nknown as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on [the\neffective date of the Newlands Resolution], and prior thereto, the\nproperty of the Hawaiian government, and to be free and clear from\nany trust of or concerning the same, and from all claim of any\nnature whatsoever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof. It\nshall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be provided by\nlaw.\u201d \u00a799,id., at 161; see also \u00a791,id., at\n159.In 1959, Congress admitted Hawaii\nto the Union. See Pub. L. 86\u20133, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission\nAct). Under the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant here,\n\u201cthe United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii, effective upon\nits admission into the Union, the United States\u2019 title to all the\npublic lands and other public property within the boundaries of the\nState of Hawaii, title to which is held by the United States\nimmediately prior to its admission into the Union.\u201d \u00a75(b),id., at 5. These lands, \u201ctogether with the proceeds from\nthe sale or other disposition of [these] lands and the income\ntherefrom, shall be held by [the] State as a public trust\u201d to\npromote various public purposes, including supporting public\neducation, bettering conditions of Native Hawaiians, developing\nhome ownership, making public improvements, and providing lands for\npublic use. \u00a75(f),id., at 6. Hawaii state law also\nauthorizes the State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided that\nthe proceeds are held in trust for the benefit of the citizens of\nHawaii. See,e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7171\u201345, 171\u201318\n(1993).In 1993, Congress enacted a joint resolution\n\u201cto acknowledge the historic significance of the illegal overthrow\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the Native\nHawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation efforts of the\nState of Hawaii and the United Church of Christ with Native\nHawaiians.\u201d Joint Resolution to Acknowledge the 100th Anniversary\nof the January 17, 1893 Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L.\n103\u2013150, 107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (hereinafter Apology Resolution). In\na series of the preambular \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses, Congress made various\nobservations about Hawaii\u2019s history. For example, the Apology\nResolution states that \u201cthe indigenous Hawaiian people never\ndirectly relinquished their claims \u2026 over their national lands to\nthe United States\u201d and that \u201cthe health and well-being of the\nNative Hawaiian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings\nand attachment to the land.\u201dId., at 1512. In the same\nvein, the resolution\u2019s only substantive section\u2014entitled\n\u201cAcknowledgement and Apology\u201d\u2014states that Congress:\u201c(1)\u2002\u2026 acknowledges the\nhistorical significance of this event which resulted in the\nsuppression of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian\npeople;\u201c(2)\u2002recognizes and commends efforts of\nreconciliation initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United\nChurch of Christ with Native Hawaiians;\u201c(3)\u2002apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf\nof the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom\nof Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the participation of agents and\ncitizens of the United States, and the deprivation of the rights of\nNative Hawaiians to self-determination;\u201c(4)\u2002expresses its commitment to acknowledge\nthe ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in\norder to provide a proper foundation for reconciliation between the\nUnited States and the Native Hawaiian people; and\u201c(5)\u2002urges the President of the United States\nto also acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the\nKingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation efforts between the\nUnited States and the Native Hawaiian people.\u201dId., at\n1513.Finally, \u00a73 of the Apology Resolution states that\n\u201cNothing in this Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a\nsettlement of any claims against the United States.\u201dId.,\nat 1514.BThis suit involves a tract of\nformer crown land on Maui, now known as the \u201cLeiali\u2019i parcel,\u201d that\nwas ceded in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d to the United States at annexation and\nhas been held by the State since 1959 as part of the trust\nestablished by \u00a75(f) of the Admission Act. The Housing Finance and\nDevelopment Corporation (HFDC)\u2014Hawaii\u2019s affordable housing\nagency\u2014received approval to remove the Leiali\u2019i parcel from the\n\u00a75(f) trust and redevelop it. In order to transfer the Leiali\u2019i\nparcel out of the public trust, HFDC was required to compensate\nrespondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established\nto receive and manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands\nfor the benefit of native Hawaiians. Haw. Const., Art. XII,\n\u00a7\u00a74\u20136.In this case, however, OHA\ndemanded more than monetary compensation. Relying on the Apology\nResolution, respondent OHA demanded that HFDC include a disclaimer\npreserving any native Hawaiian claims to ownership of lands\ntransferred from the public trust for redevelopment. HFDC declined\nto include the requested disclaimer because \u201cto do so would place a\ncloud on title, rendering title insurance unavailable.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 207a.Again relying on the Apology Resolution,\nrespondents then sued the State, its Governor, HFDC (since\nrenamed), and its officials. Respondents sought \u201cto enjoin the\ndefendants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali\u2019i\nparcel to third parties and selling or otherwise transferring to\nthird parties any of the ceded lands in general until a\ndetermination of the native Hawaiians\u2019 claims to the ceded lands is\nmade.\u201dOffice of Hawaiian Affairsv.Housing and\nCommunity Development Corp. of Hawaii, 117 Haw. 174, 189, 177\nP.\u00a03d 884, 899 (2008). Respondents \u201calleged that an injunction\nwas proper because, in light of the Apology Resolution, any\ntransfer of ceded lands by the State to third-parties would amount\nto a breach of trust \u2026\u00a0.\u201dId., at 188, 177\nP.\u00a03d, at 898.The state trial court entered judgment against\nrespondents, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the lower\ncourt\u2019s ruling. Relying on a \u201cplain reading of the Apology\nResolution,\u201d which \u201cdictate[d]\u201d its conclusion,id., at\n212, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 988, the State Supreme Court ordered \u201can\ninjunction against the defendants from selling or otherwise\ntransferring to third parties (1) the Leiali\u2019i parcel and (2) any\nother ceded lands from the public lands trust until the claims of\nthe native Hawaiians to the ceded lands have been resolved,\u201did., at 218, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 928. In doing so, the\ncourt rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201cthe State has the\nundoubted and explicit power to sell ceded lands pursuant to the\nterms of the Admission Act and pursuant to state law.\u201dId., at 211, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 920 (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted). We granted certiorari. 555 U. S.\n___ (2008).IIBefore turning to the merits, we\nfirst must address our jurisdiction. According to respondents, the\nSupreme Court of Hawaii \u201cmerely held that, in light of the ongoing\nreconciliation process, the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\nbreach of the State\u2019s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiiansunder\nstate law.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17. Because respondents\nbelieve that this case does not raise a federal question, they urge\nus to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.Although respondents dwell at\nlength on that argument, seeid., at 19\u201334, we need not\ntarry long to reject it. This Court has jurisdiction whenever \u201ca\nstate court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal\nlaw, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the\nadequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not\nclear from the face of the opinion.\u201dMichiganv.Long,463 U. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983). Far\nfrom providing a \u201cplain statement\u201d that its decision rested on\nstate law,id., at 1041, the State Supreme Court plainly\nheld that its decision was \u201cdictate[d]\u201d by federal law\u2014in\nparticular, the Apology Resolution, see 117 Haw., at 212, 177\nP.\u00a03d, at 922. Indeed, the court explained that the Apology\nResolution lies \u201c[a]t the heart of [respondents\u2019] claims,\u201d that\nrespondents\u2019 \u201ccurrent claim for injunctive relief is \u2026 based\nlargely upon the Apology Resolution,\u201d and that respondents\u2019\narguments presuppose that the Apology Resolution \u201cchanged the legal\nlandscape and restructured the rights and obligations of the\nState.\u201dId., at 189\u2013190, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 899\u2013900\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court noted that \u201c[t]he\nprimary question before this court on appeal is whether, in light\nof the Apology Resolution, this court shouldissue an\ninjunction\u201d against sale of the trust lands,id., at\n210, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 920, and it concluded, \u201c[b]ased on a plain\nreading\u201d of the Apology Resolution, that \u201cCongress has clearly\nrecognized that the native Hawaiian people have unrelinquished\nclaims over the ceded lands,\u201did., at 191, 177 P.\u00a03d,\nat 901.Based on these and the remainder of the State\nSupreme Court\u2019s 77 references to the Apology Resolution, we have no\ndoubt that the decision below rested on federal law.[Footnote 2] We are therefore satisfied that\nthis Court has jurisdiction. See 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71257.IIITurning to the merits, we must\ndecide whether the Apology Resolution \u201cstrips Hawaii of its\nsovereign authority to sell, exchange, or transfer\u201d (Pet. for Cert.\ni) the lands that the United States held in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d (30\nStat. 750) and \u201cgrant[ed] to the State of Hawaii, effective upon\nits admission into the Union\u201d (73 Stat. 5). We conclude that the\nApology Resolution has no such effect.A\u201cWe begin, as always, with the\ntext of the statute.\u201dPermanent Mission of India to United\nNationsv.City of New York,551 U. S. 193, 197\n(2007). The Apology Resolution contains two substantive provisions.\nSee 107 Stat. 1513\u20131514. Neither justifies the judgment below.The resolution\u2019s first\nsubstantive provision uses six verbs, all of which are conciliatory\nor precatory. Specifically, Congress \u201cacknowledge[d] the historical\nsignificance\u201d of the Hawaiian monarchy\u2019s overthrow, \u201crecognize[d]\nand commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\u201d with native Hawaiians,\n\u201capologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians\u201d for the monarchy\u2019s overthrow,\n\u201cexpresse[d] [Congress\u2019s] commitment to acknowledge the\nramifications of the overthrow,\u201d and \u201curge[d] the President of the\nUnited States to also acknowledge the ramifications of the\noverthrow \u2026\u00a0.\u201d \u00a71. Such terms are not the kind that Congress\nuses to create substantive rights\u2014especially those that are\nenforceable against the cosovereign States. See,e.g.,Pennhurst State School and Hospitalv.Halderman,451 U. S. 1, 17\u201318\n(1981).[Footnote 3]The Apology Resolution\u2019s second and final\nsubstantive provision is a disclaimer, which provides: \u201cNothing in\nthis Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a settlement of any\nclaims against the United States.\u201d \u00a73. By its terms, \u00a73 speaks only\nto those who may or may not have \u201cclaimsagainst the United\nStates.\u201d The court below, however, held that the only way to\nsave \u00a73 from superfluity is to construe it as a congressional\nrecognition\u2014and preservation\u2014of claimsagainst Hawaiiand\nas \u201cthefoundation(or starting point) for reconciliation\u201d\nbetween the State and native Hawaiians. 117 Haw., at 192, 177\nP.\u00a03d, at 902.\u201cWe must have regard to all the words used by\nCongress, and as far as possible give effect to them,\u201dLouisville & Nashville R. Co.v.Mottley,219 U. S. 467,\n475 (1911), but that maxim is not a judicial license to turn an\nirrelevant statutory provision into a relevant one. And we know of\nno justification for turning an express disclaimer of claims\nagainst one sovereign into an affirmative recognition of claims\nagainst another.[Footnote 4]\nCf.Pacific Bell Telephone Co.v.linkLine\nCommunications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n17) (\u201cTwo wrong claims do not make one that is right\u201d). The Supreme\nCourt of Hawaii erred in reading \u00a73 as recognizing claims\ninconsistent with the title held in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d by the United\nStates (30 Stat. 750) and conveyed to the State of Hawaii at\nstatehood. Seesupra, at 2\u20133.BRather than focusing on the\noperative words of the law, the court below directed its attention\nto the 37 \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses that preface the Apology Resolution.\nSee 107 Stat. 1510\u20131513. \u201cBased on a plain reading of\u201d the\n\u201cwhereas\u201d clauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that \u201cCongress\nhas clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people have\nunrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.\u201d 117 Haw., at 191, 177\nP.\u00a03d, at 901. That conclusion is wrong for at least three\nreasons.First, \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses like\nthose in the Apology Resolution cannot bear the weight that the\nlower court placed on them. As we recently explained in a different\ncontext, \u201cwhere the text of a clause itself indicates that it does\nnot have operative effect, such as \u2018whereas\u2019 clauses in federal\nlegislation \u2026 , a court has no license to make it do what it was\nnot designed to do.\u201dDistrict of Columbiav.Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n.\u00a03 (2008) (slip op., at\n4, n.\u00a03). See alsoYazoo & Mississippi Valley R.\nCo.v.Thomas,132 U. S. 174, 188\n(1889) (\u201c[A]s the preamble is no part of the act, and cannot\nenlarge or confer powers, nor control the words of the act, unless\nthey are doubtful or ambiguous, the necessity of resorting to it to\nassist in ascertaining the true intent and meaning of the\nlegislature is in itself fatal to the claim set up\u201d).Second, even if the \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses had some\nlegal effect, they did not \u201cchang[e] the legal landscape and\nrestructur[e] the rights and obligations of the State.\u201d 117 Haw.,\nat 190, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 900. As we have emphasized, \u201crepeals by\nimplication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the\nintention of the legislature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.\u201dNational Assn. of Home Buildersv.Defenders of\nWildlife,551\nU. S. 644, 662 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nApology Resolution reveals no indication\u2014much less a \u201cclear and\nmanifest\u201d one\u2014that Congress intended to amend or repeal the State\u2019s\nrights and obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal\nlaw); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence that\nCongress intendedsub silentioto \u201ccloud\u201d the title that\nthe United States held in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d and transferred to the\nState in 1959. On that score, we find it telling that even\nrespondent OHA has now abandoned its argument, made below, that\n\u201cCongress \u2026 enacted the Apology Resolution and thus \u2026 change[d]\u201d\nthe Admission Act. App. 114a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31,\n37\u201338.Third, the Apology Resolution would\nraise grave constitutional concerns if it purported to \u201ccloud\u201d\nHawaii\u2019s title to its sovereign lands more than three decades after\nthe State\u2019s admission to the Union. We have emphasized that\n\u201cCongress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey submerged\nlands that have already been bestowed upon a State.\u201dIdahov.United States,533 U. S. 262, 280,\nn.\u00a09 (2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted);\nsee alsoid., at 284 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting)\n(\u201c[T]he consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores\nthe uniquely sovereign character of that event \u2026 to suggest that\nsubsequent events somehow can diminish what has already been\nbestowed\u201d). And that proposition appliesa fortioriwhere\nvirtually all of the State\u2019s public lands\u2014not just its submerged\nones\u2014are at stake. In light of those concerns, we must not read the\nApology Resolution\u2019s nonsubstantive \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses to create a\nretroactive \u201ccloud\u201d on the title that Congress granted to the State\nof Hawaii in 1959. See,e.g.,Clarkv.Martinez,543 U. S. 371, 381\u2013382\n(2005) (the canon of constitutional avoidance \u201cis a tool for\nchoosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory\ntext, resting on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not\nintend the alternative which raises serious constitutional\ndoubts\u201d).*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*When a state supreme court\nincorrectly bases a decision on federal law, the court\u2019s decision\nimproperly prevents the citizens of the State from addressing the\nissue in question through the processes provided by the State\u2019s\nconstitution. Here, the State Supreme Court incorrectly held that\nCongress, by adopting the Apology Resolution, took away from the\ncitizens of Hawaii the authority to resolve an issue that is of\ngreat importance to the people of the State. Respondents defend\nthat decision by arguing that they have both state-law property\nrights in the land in question and \u201cbroader moral and political\nclaims for compensation for the wrongs of the past.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 18. But we have no authority to decide questions of\nHawaiian law or to provide redress for past wrongs except as\nprovided for by federal law. The judgment of the Supreme Court of\nHawaii is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.Footnote 1\u201cCrown lands\u201d were lands formerly held by the\nHawaiian monarchy. \u201cPublic\u201d and \u201cGovernment\u201d lands were other lands\nheld by the Hawaiian government.Footnote 2Respondents argue that the Supreme Court of\nHawaii relied on the Apology Resolution \u201csimply to support its\nfactual determination that Native Hawaiians have unresolved claims\nto the ceded lands.\u201d Brief for Respondents 21. Regardless of its\nfactual determinations, however, the lower court\u2019slegalconclusions were, at the very least, \u201cinterwoven with the federal\nlaw.\u201dMichiganv.Long,463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983). SeeOffice of Hawaiian Affairsv.Housing and Community\nDevelopment Corp. of Hawaii, 117 Haw. 174, 217, 218, 177\nP.\u00a03d 884, 927, 928 (2008) (\u201chold[ing]\u201d that respondents\u2019\nlegal claim \u201carose\u201d only when \u201cthe Apology Resolution was signed\ninto law on November 23, 1993\u201d);id., at 211, n.\u00a025,\n177 P.\u00a03d, at 921, n.\u00a025 (emphasizing that \u201cour holding\nis grounded in Hawai\u2018i and federal law\u201d). See also n.\u00a04,infra.Footnote 3The Apology Resolution\u2019s operative provisions\nthus stand in sharp contrast with those of other \u201capologies,\u201d which\nCongress intended to have substantive effect. See,e.g.,\nCivil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 903, 50 U. S.\u00a0C. App.\n\u00a71989 (2000 ed.) (acknowledging and apologizing \u201cfor the\nevacuation, relocation and internment\u201d of Japanese citizens during\nWorld War II and providing $20,000 in restitution to each eligible\nindividual); Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, 104 Stat. 920,\nnotes following 42 U.

And it further held that\npetitioners failed to show that the State has the \u201cpower to sell\nceded lands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act.\u201dId., at 211, 177 P.\u00a03d, at 921 (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted). Respondents now insist, however,\nthat their claims are \u201cnonjusticiable\u201d to the extent that they are\ngrounded on \u201cbroader moral and political\u201d bases. Brief for\nRespondents 18. No matter how respondents characterize their\nclaims, it is undeniable that they have asserted title to the ceded\nlands throughout this litigation, seeid., at 40,\nn.\u00a015 (conceding the point), and it is undeniable that the\nSupreme Court of Hawaii relied on those claims in issuing an\ninjunction, which is a legal (and hence justiciable) remedy\u2014not a\nmoral, political, or nonjusticiable one.",
