Ind. Code \u00a716\u201341\u201316\u20134(d)\n(2019); see \u00a7\u00a716\u201341\u201316\u20132, 16\u201341\u201316\u20134, 16\u201341\u201316\u20135; Ind. Admin. Code,\ntit. 410, \u00a7\u00a735\u20131\u20133, 35\u20132\u20131(a)(2) (2019). A panel of the Seventh\nCircuit held that this fetal-remains law was irrational, and thus\nunconstitutional, under the doctrine of \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d\nThat decision was manifestly inconsistent with our precedent, as\nthe Court holds.[1] I would\nhave thought it could go without saying that nothing in the\nConstitution or any decision of this Court prevents a State from\nrequiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful\ntreatment of human remains.I write separately to address the other aspect\nof Indiana law at issue here\u2014the \u201cSex Selective and Disability\nAbortion Ban.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a716\u201334\u20134\u20131et\u00a0seq.This\nstatute makes it illegal for an abortion provider to perform an\nabortion in Indiana when the provider knows that the mother is\nseeking the abortion solely because of the child\u2019s race, sex,\ndiagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.\n\u00a7\u00a716\u201334\u20134\u20131 to 16\u201334\u20134\u20138; see \u00a716\u201334\u20134\u20131(b) (excluding \u201clethal\nfetal anomal[ies]\u201d from the definition of disability). The law\nrequires that the mother be advised of this restriction and given\ninformation about financial assistance and adoption alternatives,\nbut it imposes liability only on the provider. See\n\u00a7\u00a716\u201334\u20132\u20131.1(a)(1)(K), (2)(A)\u2013(C), 16\u201334\u20134\u20139. Each of the\nimmutable characteristics protected by this law can be known\nrelatively early in a pregnancy, and the law prevents them from\nbecoming the sole criterion for deciding whether the child will\nlive or die. Put differently, this law and other laws like it\npromote a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from\nbecoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.[2]The use of abortion to achieve eugenic goals is\nnot merely hypothetical. The foundations for legalizing abortion in\nAmerica were laid during the early 20th-century birth-control\nmovement. That movement developed alongside the American eugenics\nmovement. And significantly, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret\nSanger recognized the eugenic potential of her cause. She\nemphasized and embraced the notion that birth control \u201copens the\nway to the eugenist.\u201d Sanger, Birth Control and Racial Betterment,\nBirth Control Rev., Feb. 1919, p.\u00a012 (Racial Betterment). As a\nmeans of reducing the \u201cever increasing, unceasingly spawning class\nof human beings who never should have been born at all,\u201d Sanger\nargued that \u201cBirth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest\nand most truly eugenic method\u201d of \u201chuman generation.\u201d M. Sanger,\nPivot of Civilization 187, 189 (1922) (Pivot of Civilization). In\nher view, birth control had been \u201caccepted by the most clear\nthinking and far seeing of the Eugenists themselves as the most\nconstructive and necessary of the means to racial health.\u201dId., at 189.It is true that Sanger was not referring to\nabortion when she made these statements, at least not directly. She\nrecognized a moral difference between \u201ccontraceptives\u201d and other,\nmore \u201cextreme\u201d ways for \u201cwomen to limit their families,\u201d such as\n\u201cthe horrors of abortion and infanticide.\u201d M. Sanger, Woman and the\nNew Race 25, 5 (1920) (Woman and the New Race). But Sanger\u2019s\narguments about the eugenic value of birth control in securing \u201cthe\nelimination of the unfit,\u201d Racial Betterment 11, apply with even\ngreater force to abortion, making it significantly more effective\nas a tool of eugenics. Whereas Sanger believed that birth control\ncould prevent \u201cunfit\u201d people from reproducing, abortion can prevent\nthem from being born in the first place. Many eugenicists therefore\nsupported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates\u2014including\nfuture Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher\u2014endorsed the\nuse of abortion for eugenic reasons. Technological advances have\nonly heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can\nnow be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics,\nsuch as a particular sex or disability.Given the potential for abortion to become a\ntool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront\nthe constitutionality of laws like Indiana\u2019s. But because further\npercolation may assist our review of this issue of first\nimpression, I join the Court in declining to take up the issue\nnow.IThe term \u201ceugenics\u201d was coined in 1883 by\nFrancis Galton, a British statistician and half-cousin of Charles\nDarwin. See S. Caron, Who Chooses?: American Reproductive History\nSince 1830, p.\u00a049 (2008); A. Cohen, Imbeciles: The Supreme\nCourt, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck 46\n(2016) (Imbeciles). Galton described eugenics as \u201cthe science of\nimproving stock\u201d through \u201call influences that tend in however\nremote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of\nblood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suit-\nable than they otherwise would have.\u201d F. Galton, Inquiries Into\nHuman Faculty and Its Development 25, n.\u00a01 (1883). Eugenics\nthus rests on the assumption that \u201cman\u2019s natural abilities are\nderived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are\nthe form and physical features of the whole organic world.\u201d F.\nGalton, Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry Into Its Laws and\nConsequences 1 (1869) (Hereditary Genius); see Imbeciles 46\u201347. As\na social theory, eugenics is rooted in social\nDarwinism\u2014i.e., the application of the \u201csurvival of the\nfittest\u201d principle to human society. Caron,supra, at 49;\nImbeciles 45. Galton argued that by promoting reproduction between\npeople with desirable qualities and inhibiting reproduction of the\nunfit, man could improve society by \u201cdo[ing] providently, quickly,\nand kindly\u201d \u201c[w]hat Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly.\u201d\nF. Galton, Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope and Aims, in Essays in\nEugenics 42 (1909).By the 1920s, eugenics had become a\n\u201cfull-fledged intellectual craze\u201d in the United States,\nparticularly among progressives, professionals, and intellectual\nelites. Imbeciles 2; seeid., at 2\u20134, 55\u201357; Cohen,\nHarvard\u2019s Eugenics Era, Harvard Magazine, pp.\u00a048\u201352 (Mar.\u2013Apr.\n2016) (Harvard\u2019s Eugenics Era). Leaders in the eugenics movement\nheld prominent positions at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, among\nother schools, and eugenics was taught at 376 universities and\ncolleges. Imbeciles 4; see also Harvard\u2019s Eugenics Era 48. Although\neugenics was widely embraced, Harvard was \u201cmore central to American\neugenics than any other university,\u201d with administrators, faculty\nmembers, and alumni \u201cfounding eugenics organizations, writing\nacademic and popular eugenics articles, and lobbying government to\nenact eugenics laws.\u201dIbid.; seeid., at 49\u201352. One\nHarvard faculty member even published a leading textbook on the\nsubject through the Harvard University Press, Genetics and\nEugenics.Id., at 49.Many eugenicists believed that the distinction\nbetween the fit and the unfit could be drawn along racial lines, a\ndistinction they justified by pointing to anecdotal and statistical\nevidence of disparities between the races. Galton, for example,\npurported to show as a scientific matter that \u201cthe average\nintellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below\u201d\nthat of the Anglo-Saxon, and that \u201cthe number among the negroes of\nthose whom we should call half-witted men, is very large.\u201d\nHereditary Genius 338\u2013339. Other eugenicists similarly concluded\nthat \u201cthe Negro .\u00a0.\u00a0. is in the large eugenicallyinferiorto the white\u201d based on \u201cthe relative achievements\nof the race\u201d and statistical disparities in educational outcomes\nand life expectancy in North America, among other factors. P.\nPopenoe & R. Johnson, Applied Eugenics 285 (1920) (Applied\nEugenics); seeid., at 280\u2013297 (elaborating on this view);\nsee also,e.g., R. Gates, Heredity and Eugenics 234 (1923)\n(citing disparities between white and black people and concluding\nthat \u201cthe negro\u2019s mental status is thus undoubtedly more primitive\nthan that of the white man\u201d); Hunt, Hand, Pettis, & Russell,\nAbstract, Family Stock Values in White-Negro Crosses: A Note on\nMiscegenation, 8 Eugenical News 67 (1923) (\u201cExperiments, as well as\ngeneral experience, indicate that the average inborn intelligence\nof the white man is considerably higher than that of the\nnegro\u201d).Building on similar assumptions, eugenicist\nLothrop Stoddard argued that the \u201cprodigious birth-rate\u201d of the\nnonwhite races was bringing the world to a racial tipping point. L.\nStoddard, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\n8\u20139 (1920). Stoddard feared that without \u201cartificial barriers,\u201d the\nraces \u201cwill increasingly mingle, and the inevitable result will be\nthe supplanting or absorption of the higher by the lower types.\u201dId., at 302. Allowing the white race to be overtaken by\ninferior races, according to Stoddard, would be a tragedy of his-\ntoric proportions:\u201c[T]hat would mean that the race obviously\nendowed with the greatest creative ability, the race which had\nachieved most in the past and which gave the richer promise for the\nfuture, had passed away, carrying with it to the grave those\npotencies upon which the realization of man\u2019s highest hopes\ndepends. A million years of human evolution might go uncrowned, and\nearth\u2019s supreme life-product, man, might never fulfil his potential\ndestiny. This is why we today face \u2018The Crisis of the Ages.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 304.Eugenic arguments like these helped precipitate\nthe Immigration Act of 1924, which significantly reduced\nimmigration from outside of Western and Northern Europe.\n\u00a7\u00a711(a)\u2013(b), 43Stat. 159; Imbeciles 126\u2013135; see alsoid.,\nat 135 (discussing the difficulties the Act created for many Jews\nseeking to flee Nazism). The perceived superiority of the white\nrace also led to calls for race consciousness in marital and\nreproductive decisions, including through antimiscegenation laws.\nApplied Eugenics 296 (\u201cWe hold that it is to the interests of the\nUnited States .\u00a0.\u00a0. to prevent further Negro-white\namalgamation\u201d).Although race was relevant, eugenicists did not\ndefine a person\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d exclusively by race. A typical list of\ndysgenic individuals would also include some combination of the\n\u201cfeeble-minded,\u201d \u201cinsane,\u201d \u201ccriminalistic,\u201d \u201cdeformed,\u201d \u201ccrippled,\u201d\n\u201cepileptic,\u201d \u201cinebriate,\u201d \u201cdiseased,\u201d \u201cblind,\u201d \u201cdeaf,\u201d and\n\u201cdependent (including orphans and paupers).\u201d Imbeciles 139; see\nApplied Eugenics 176\u2013183; cf. G. Chesterton, Eugenics and Other\nEvils 61 (1922) (\u201c[F]eeble-mindedness is a new phrase under which\nyou might segregate anybody\u201d because \u201cthis phrase conveys nothing\nfixed and outside opinion\u201d). Immigration policy was insufficient to\naddress these \u201cdanger[s] from within,\u201d Imbeciles 4, so eugenicists\nturned to other solutions. Many States adopted laws prohibiting\nmarriages between certain feebleminded, epileptic, or other \u201cunfit\u201d\nindividuals, but forced sterilization emerged as the preferred\nsolution for many classes of dysgenic individuals.Id., at\n63, 66. Indiana enacted the first eugenic sterilization law in\n1907, and a number of other States followed suit.Id., at\n70.This Court threw its prestige behind the\neugenics movement in its 1927 decision upholding the\nconstitutionality of Virginia\u2019s forced-sterilization law,Buckv.Bell,274 U.S.\n200. The plaintiff, Carrie Buck, had been found to be \u201ca feeble\nminded white woman\u201d who was \u201cthe daughter of a feeble minded mother\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. and the mother of an illegitimate feeble minded\nchild.\u201dId., at 205.[3]\nIn an opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and\njoined by seven other Justices, the Court offered a full-throated\ndefense of forced sterilization:\u201cWe have seen more than once that the\npublic welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It\nwould be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap\nthe strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not\nfelt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being\nswamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if\ninstead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to\nlet them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who\nare manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that\nsustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting\nthe Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\u201dId., at 207 (citation omitted).The Court\u2019s decision gave the eugenics movement\nadded legitimacy and considerable momentum; by 1931, 28 of the\nNation\u2019s 48 States had adopted eugenic sterilization laws.\nImbeciles 299\u2013300. Buck was one of more than 60,000 people who were\ninvoluntarily sterilized between 1907 and 1983.Id., at\n319.Support for eugenics waned considerably by the\n1940s as Americans became familiar with the eugenics of the Nazis\nand scientific literature undermined the assumptions on which the\neugenics movement was built. But even today, the Court continues to\nattribute legal significance to the same types of racial-disparity\nevidence that were used to justify race-based eugenics. See T.\nSowell, Discrimination and Disparities 5\u20136 (rev. ed. 2019)\n(Sowell).[4] And support for\nthe goal of reducing undesirable populations through selective\nreproduction has by no means vanished.IIThis case highlights the fact that abortion is\nan act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the\nbeginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of\neffectuating eugenics. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger\nwas particularly open about the fact that birth control could be\nused for eugenic purposes. These arguments about the eugenic\npotential for birth control apply with even greater force to\nabortion, which can be used to target specific children with\nunwanted characteristics. Even after World War II, future Planned\nParenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates\nendorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of\ncontrolling the population and improving its quality. As explained\nbelow, a growing body of evidence suggests that eugenic goals are\nalready being realized through abortion.ALike many elites of her day, Sanger accepted\nthat eugenics was \u201cthe most adequate and thorough avenue to the\nsolution of racial, political and social problems.\u201d Sanger, The\nEugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda, Birth Control Rev., Oct.\n1921, p.\u00a05 (Propaganda). She agreed with eugenicists that \u201cthe\nunbalance between the birth rate of the \u2018unfit\u2019 and the\n\u2018fit\u2019\u00a0\u201d was \u201cthe greatest present menace to civilization.\u201dIbid.Particularly \u201cin a democracy like that of the United\nStates,\u201d where \u201c[e]quality of political power has .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nbeen bestowed upon the lowest elements of our population,\u201d Sanger\nworried that \u201creckless spawning carries with it the seeds of\ndestruction.\u201d Pivot of Civilization 177\u2013178.Although Sanger believed that society was\n\u201cindebted\u201d to \u201cthe Eugenists\u201d for diagnosing these problems, she\ndid not believe that they had \u201cshow[n] much power in suggesting\npractical and feasible remedies.\u201dId., at 178.\u201cAs an\nadvocate of Birth Control,\u201d Sanger attempted to fill the gap by\nshowing that birth control had \u201ceugenic and civilizational value.\u201d\nPropaganda 5. In her view, birth-control advocates and eugenicists\nwere \u201cseeking a single end\u201d\u2014\u201cto assist the race toward the\nelimination of the unfit.\u201d Racial Betterment 11. But Sanger\nbelieved that the focus should be \u201cupon stopping not only the\nreproduction of the unfit but upon stoppingallreproduction\nwhen there is not economic means of providing proper care for those\nwho are born in health.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Thus, for\nSanger, forced sterilization did \u201cnot go to the bottom of the\nmatter\u201d because it did not \u201ctouc[h] the great problem of unlimited\nreproduction\u201d of \u201cthose great masses, who through economic pressure\npopulate the slums and there produce in their helplessness other\nhelpless, diseased and incompetent masses, who overwhelm all that\neugenics can do among those whose economic condition is better.\u201dId., at 12. In Sanger\u2019s view, frequent reproduction among\n\u201cthe majority of wage workers\u201d would lead to \u201cthe contributing of\nmorons, feeble-minded, insane and various criminal types to the\nalready tremendous social burden constituted by these unfit.\u201dIbid.Sanger believed that birth control was an\nimportant part of the solution to these societal ills. She\nexplained, \u201cBirth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest\nand most truly eugenic method\u201d of \u201chuman generation,\u201d \u201cand its\nadoption as part of the program of Eugenics would immediately give\na concrete and realistic power to that science.\u201d Pivot of\nCivilization 189. Sanger even argued that \u201ceugenists and others who\nare laboring for racial betterment\u201d could not \u201csucceed\u201d unless they\n\u201cfirst clear[ed] the way for Birth Control.\u201d Racial Betterment 11.\nIf \u201cthe masses\u201d were given \u201cpractical education in Birth\nControl\u201d\u2014for which there was \u201calmost universal demand\u201d\u2014then the\n\u201cEugenic educator\u201d could use \u201cBirth Control propaganda\u201d to \u201cdirect\na thorough education in Eugenics\u201d and influence the reproductive\ndecisions of the unfit. Propaganda 5. In this way, \u201cthe campaign\nfor Birth Control [was] not merely of eugenic value, but [was]\npractically identical in ideal with the final aims of Eugenics.\u201dIbid.Sanger herself campaigned for birth control in\nblack communities. In 1930, she opened a birth-control clinic in\nHarlem. See Birth Control or Race Control? Sanger and the Negro\nProject, Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter #28 (2001),\nhttp://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/ articles/bc_or_race_control.php\n(all Internet materials as last visited May 24, 2019). Then, in\n1939, Sanger initiated the \u201cNegro Project,\u201d an effort to promote\nbirth control in poor, Southern black communities.Ibid.Noting that blacks were \u201c\u00a0\u2018notoriously underprivileged and\nhandicapped to a large measure by a \u201ccaste\u201d system,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she\nargued in a fundraising letter that \u201c\u00a0\u2018birth control knowledge\nbrought to this group, is the most direct, constructive aid that\ncan be given them to improve their immediate situation.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.In a report titled \u201cBirth Control and the Negro,\u201d\nSanger and her coauthors identified blacks as \u201c\u00a0\u2018the great\nproblem of the South\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014\u201cthe group with \u2018the greatest\neconomic, health, and social problems\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014and developed a\nbirth-control program geared toward this population.Ibid.She later emphasized that black ministers should be involved in the\nprogram, noting, \u201c\u00a0\u2018We do not want word to go out that we want\nto exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man\nwho can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their\nmore rebellious members.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.Defenders of Sanger point out that W. E. B.\nDuBois and other black leaders supported the Negro Project and\nargue that her writings should not be read to imply a racial bias.Ibid.; see Planned Parenthood, Opposition Claims About\nMargaret Sanger (2016), https://www.\nplannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/37/\u00a0fd\u00a0/\u00a037fdc7b6-\nde5f-4d22\u00a0-\u00a08c05\u00a0-\u00a09568268e92d8\u00a0/\u00a0sanger_opposition_claims_\nfact_sheet_2016.pdf. But Sanger\u2019s motives are immaterial to the\npoint relevant here: that \u201cBirth Control\u201d has long been understood\nto \u201cope[n] the way to the eugenist.\u201d Racial Betterment 12.BTo be sure, Sanger distinguished between birth\ncontrol and abortion. Woman and the New Race 128\u2013129; see,e.g., Sanger, Birth Control or Abortion? Birth Control Rev.,\nDec. 1918, pp.\u00a03\u20134. For Sanger, \u201c[t]he one means health and\nhappiness\u2014a stronger, better race,\u201d while \u201c[t]he other means\ndisease, suffering, [and] death.\u201d Woman and the New Race 129.\nSanger argued that \u201cnothing short of contraceptives can put an end\nto the horrors of abortion and infanticide,\u201did., at 25, and\nshe questioned whether \u201cwe want the precious, tender qualities of\nwomanhood, so much needed for our racial development, to perish in\n[the] sordid, abnormal experiences\u201d of abortions,id., at\n29. In short, unlike contraceptives, Sanger regarded \u201cthe hundreds\nof thousands of abortions performed in America each year [as] a\ndisgrace to civilization.\u201dId., at 126.Although Sanger was undoubtedly correct in\nrecognizing a moral difference between birth control and abortion,\nthe eugenic arguments that she made in support of birth control\napply with even greater force to abortion. Others were well aware\nthat abortion could be used as a \u201cmetho[d] of eugenics,\u201d 6 H.\nEllis, Studies in the Psychology of Sex 617 (1910), and they were\nenthusiastic about that possibility. Indeed, some eugenicists\nbelieved that abortion should be legal for the verypurposeof promoting eugenics.

In 1959, for example, Guttmacher\nexplicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion. A. Guttmacher,\nBabies by Choice or by Chance 186\u2013188 (1959). He explained that\n\u201cthe quality of the parents must be taken into account,\u201d including\n\u201c[f\u00a0]eeble-mindedness,\u201d and believed that \u201cit should be\npermissible to abort any pregnancy .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which there\nis a strong probability of an abnormal or malformed infant.\u201dId., at 198. He added that the question whether to allow\nabortion must be \u201cseparated from emotional, moral and religious\nconcepts\u201d and \u201cmust have as its focus normal, healthy infants born\ninto homes peopled with parents who have healthy bodies and minds.\u201dId., at 221. Similarly, legal scholar Glanville Williams\nwrote that he was open to the possibility of eugenic infanticide,\nat least in some situations, explaining that \u201can eugenic killing by\na mother, exactly paralleled by the bitch that kills her mis-\nshapen puppies, cannot confidently be pronounced im- moral.\u201d G.\nWilliams, Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law 20 (1957). The\nCourt cited Williams\u2019 book for a different proposition inRoev.Wade,410 U.S.\n113, 130, n.\u00a09 (1973).But public aversion to eugenics after World War\nII also led many to avoid explicit references to that term. The\nAmerican Eugenics Society, for example, changed the name of its\nscholarly publication from \u201cEugenics Quarterly\u201d to \u201cSocial\nBiology.\u201d See D. Paul, Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the\nPresent, p.\u00a0125 (1995). In explaining the name change, the\njournal\u2019s editor stated that it had become evident that eugenic\ngoals could be achieved \u201cfor reasons other than eugenics.\u201dIbid.For example, \u201c[b]irth control and abortion are turning\nout to be great eugenic advances of our time. If they had been\nadvanced for eugenic reasons it would have retarded or stopped\ntheir acceptance.\u201dIbid.But whether they used the term\n\u201ceugenics\u201d or not, abortion advocates echoed the arguments of early\n20th-century eugenicists by describing abortion as a way to achieve\n\u201cpopulation control\u201d and to improve the \u201cquality\u201d of the\npopulation. One journal declared that \u201cabortion is the one mode of\npopulation limitation which has demonstrated the speedy impact\nwhich it can make upon a national problem.\u201d Notes of the Quarter:\nThe Personal and the Universal, 53 Eugenics Rev. 186 (1962).\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s leaders echoed these themes.

Brief in Opposition 1. And with today\u2019s prenatal\nscreening tests and other technologies, abortion can easily be used\nto eliminate children with unwanted characteristics. Indeed, the\nindividualized nature of abortion gives it even more eugenic\npotential than birth control, which simply reduces the chance of\nconceivinganychild. As petitioners and severalamicus\ncuriaebriefs point out, moreover, abortion has proved to be a\ndisturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory\npreferences that undergird eugenics.E.g., Pet. for Cert.\n22\u201326; Brief for State of Wisconsin et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae19\u201325; Brief for Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission\nof the Southern Baptist Convention et\u00a0al. asAmici\nCuriae9\u201310.In Iceland, the abortion rate for children\ndiagnosed with Down syndrome in utero approaches 100%. See Will,\nThe Down Syndrome Genocide, Washington Post, Mar. 15, 2018,\np.\u00a0A23, col. 1. Other European countries have similarly high\nrates, and the rate in the United States is approximately\ntwo-thirds.

See M. Hvistendahl,\nUnnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the Consequences\nof a World Full of Men 5\u20136 (2011); see also Kalantry, How To Fix\nIndia\u2019s Sex-Selection Problem, N.\u00a0Y.

Today there are about 50 million more men than women in the\ncountry\u201d). And recent evidence suggests that sex-selective\nabortions of girls are common among certain populations in the\nUnited States as well. See Almond & Sun, Son-Biased Sex Ratios\nin 2010 U.\u00a0S.

Nat. Acad. of Sci. 5681\n(2008) (similar).Eight decades after Sanger\u2019s \u201cNegro Project,\u201d\nabortion in the United States is also marked by a considerable\nracial disparity. The reported nationwide abortion ratio\u2014 the\nnumber of abortions per 1,000 live births\u2014among black women is\nnearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women. Dept. of Health and\nHuman Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, T.\nJatlaoui et\u00a0al., Abortion Surveillance\u2014United States, 2015, 67\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Surveillance Summaries, No.\nSS\u201313, p.\u00a035 (Nov. 23, 2018) (Table 13); see also Brief for\nRestoration Project et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae5\u20136. And\nthere are areas of New York City in which black children are more\nlikely to be aborted than they are to be born alive\u2014and are up to\neight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the\nsame area. See N.\u00a0Y. Dept. of Health, Table 23: Induced\nAbortion and Abortion Ratios by Race/Ethnicity and Resident County\nNew York State\u20132016,\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/\n2016/table23.htm. Whatever the reasons for these disparities, they\nsuggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of \u201cfamily\nplanning,\u201d black people do indeed \u201ctak[e] the brunt of the\n\u2018planning.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dempsey,supra, at\u00a082.Some believe that the United States is already\nexperiencing the eugenic effects of abortion. According to one\neconomist, \u201cRoe v. Wadehelp[ed] trigger, a generation\nlater, the greatest crime drop in recorded history.\u201d S. Levitt\n& S. Dubner, Freakonomics 6 (2005); seeid., at 136\u2013144\n(elaborating on this theory). On this view, \u201cit turns out that not\nall children are born equal\u201d in terms of criminal propensity.Id., at 6.And legalized abortion meant that the\nchildren of \u201cpoor, unmarried, and teenage mothers\u201d who were \u201cmuch\nmore likely than average to become criminals\u201d \u201cweren\u2019t being born.\u201dIbid.(emphasis deleted). Whether accurate or not, these\nobservations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by\nSanger decades earlier: \u201cBirth Control of itself .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nwill make a better race\u201d and tend \u201ctoward the elimination of the\nunfit.\u201d Racial Betterment 11\u201312.IIIIt was against this background that Indiana\u2019s\nLegislature, on the 100th anniversary of its 1907 sterilization\nlaw, adopted a concurrent resolution formally \u201cexpress[ing] its\nregret over Indiana\u2019s role in the eugenics movement in this country\nand the injustices done under eugenic laws.\u201d Ind. S. Res. 91, 115th\nGen. Assemb., 1st Sess., \u00a71 (2007); see Brief for Pro-Life Legal\nDefense Fund et\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae6\u20138. Recognizing\nthat laws implementing eugenic goals \u201ctargeted the most vulnerable\namong us, including the poor and racial minorities, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nfor the claimed purpose of public health and the good of the\npeople,\u201d Ind. S. Res. 91, at 2, the General Assembly \u201curge[d] the\ncitizens of Indiana to become familiar with the history of the\neugenics movement\u201d and \u201crepudiate the many laws passed in the name\nof eugenics and reject any such laws in the future,\u201did.,\n\u00a72.In March 2016, the Indiana Legislature passed by\nwide margins the Sex-Selective and Disability Abortion Ban at issue\nhere. Respondent Planned Parenthood promptly filed a lawsuit to\nblock the law from going into effect, arguing that the Constitution\ncategorically protects a woman\u2019s right to abort her child based\nsolely on the child\u2019s race, sex, or disability. The District Court\nagreed, granting a preliminary injunction on the eve of the law\u2019s\neffective date, followed by a permanent injunction. A panel of the\nSeventh Circuit affirmed. Pointing toPlanned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pa.v.Casey,505 U.S.\n833(1992), both the District Court and the Seventh Circuit\nheld that this Court had already decided the matter:\n\u201cCasey\u2019s holding that a woman has the right to terminate her\npregnancy prior to viability is categorical.\u201dPlanned Parenthood\nof Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.v.Commissioner of Indiana\nState Dept. of Health, 888 F.3d 300, 305 (CA7 2018); seePlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.v.Commissioner,Indiana State Dept. of Health, 265\nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d 859, 866 (SD Ind. 2017). In an opinion dissenting\nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Easterbrook expressed\nskepticism as to this holding, explaining that \u201cCaseydid\nnot consider the validity of an anti-eugenics law\u201d and that\njudicial opinions, unlike statutes, \u201cresolve only the situations\npresented for decision.\u201dPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and\nKentucky, Inc.v.Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of\nHealth, 917 F.3d 532, 536 (CA7 2018).Judge Easterbrook was correct. Whatever else\nmight be said aboutCasey, it did not decide whether the\nConstitution requires States to allow eugenic abortions. It\naddressed the constitutionality of only \u201cfive provisions of the\nPennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982\u201d that were said to burden\nthe supposed constitutional right to an abortion.Casey,supra, at 844. None of those provisions prohibited abortions\nbased solely on race, sex, or disability. In fact, the very first\nparagraph of the respondents\u2019 brief inCaseymade it clear\nto the Court that Pennsylvania\u2019s prohibition on sex-selective\nabortions was \u201cnot [being] challenged,\u201d Brief for Respondents inPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v.Casey, O.\nT. 1991, Nos. 91\u2013744, 91\u2013902, p.\u00a04. In light of the Court\u2019s\ndenial of certiorari today, the constitutionality of other laws\nlike Indiana\u2019s thus remains an open question.The Court\u2019s decision to allow further\npercolation should not be interpreted as agreement with the\ndecisions below. Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion\nbased solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as\nPlanned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of\nthe 20th-century eugenics movement. In other contexts, the Court\nhas been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even\npotentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination.\nCf.Pena-Rodriguezv.Colorado, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___,\n___ (2017) (slip op., at 15) (condemning \u201cdiscrimination on the\nbasis of race\u201d as \u201c\u00a0\u2018odious in all aspects\u2019\u00a0\u201d);United\nStatesv.Virginia,518 U.S.\n515, 532 (1996) (denouncing any \u201claw or official policy [that]\ndenies to women, simply because they are women, .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nequal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute\nto society based on their individual talents and capacities\u201d);Tennesseev.Lane,541 U.S.\n509, 522 (2004) (condemning \u201cirrational disability\ndiscrimination\u201d).Although the Court declines to wade into these\nissues today, we cannot avoid them forever. Having created the\nconstitutional right to an abortion, this Court is dutybound to\naddress its scope. In that regard, it is easy to understand why the\nDistrict Court and the Seventh Circuit looked toCaseyto\nresolve a question it did not address. Where else could they turn?\nThe Constitution itself is silent on abortion.With these observations, I join the opinion of\nthe Court.Notes1Justice Ginsburg\u2019s\ndissent from this holding makes little sense. It is not a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018waste\u2019\u00a0\u201d of our resources to summarily reverse an\nincorrect decision that created a Circuit split.Post, at 2.\nAnd Justice Ginsburg does not even attempt to argue that the\ndecision below was correct. Instead, she adopts Chief Judge Wood\u2019s\nalternative suggestion that regulating the disposition of an\naborted child\u2019s body might impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the mother\u2019s\nright to abort that (already aborted) child. Seepost, at 1.\nThis argument is difficult to understand, to say the least\u2014which\nmay explain why even respondent Planned Parenthood did not make it.\nThe argument also lacks evidentiary support. SeePlanned\nParenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.v.Commissioner of\nIndiana State Dept. of Health, 917 F.3d 532, 538 (CA7 2018) (en\nbanc) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).2See,e.g., Ariz.\nRev.

My focus\non a State\u2019s compelling interest in prohibiting eugenics in\nabortion does not suggest that States lack other compelling\ninterests in adopting these or other abortion-related\nlaws.3The finding that Buck was\n\u201cfeeble minded\u201d was apparently wrong.
