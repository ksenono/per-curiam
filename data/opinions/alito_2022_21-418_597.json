KENNEDY, PETITIONERv.BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICTon writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[June 27, 2022]Justice Alito, concurring.The expression at issue in this case is unlike\nthat in any of our prior cases involving the free-speech rights of\npublic employees. Petitioner\u2019s expression occurred while at work\nbut during a time when a brief lull in his duties apparently gave\nhim a few free moments to engage in private activities. When he\nengaged in this expression, he acted in a purely private capacity.\nThe Court does not decide what standard applies to such expression\nunder the Free Speech Clause but holds only that retaliation for\nthis expression cannot be justified based on any of the standards\ndiscussed. On that understanding, I join the opinion in full.",
