McDANIEL, WARDEN, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERSv.TROY BROWNon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit[January 11, 2010]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice\nScalia joins, concurring.I join theper curiambecause it correctly holds that the Ninth Circuit erred in\ndeparting fromJackson\u2019s mandate that a federal habeas\ncourt confine its sufficiency-of-the-evidence analysis to \u201cthe\nevidence adduced at trial\u201d and, specifically, to \u201c\u00a0\u2018all of the\nevidence admitted by the trial court.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAnte, at 11\n(quotingLockhartv.Nelson,488 U. S. 33, 41 (1988)); seeJacksonv.Virginia,443 U. S. 307(1979). I write\nseparately because I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to\ncomplicate its analysis with an extensive discussion of the Mueller\nReport. Seeante, at 7\u201313. Defense counsel commissioned\nthat report 11 years after respondent\u2019s trial. Seeante,\nat 1. Accordingly, the report\u2019s attacks on the State\u2019s DNA\ntestimony were not part of the trial evidence and have no place in\ntheJacksoninquiry. SeeJackson,supra,\nat 318;Lockhart,supra, at 40\u201342. That is all we\nneed or should say about the report in deciding this case.The Court\u2019s opinion demonstrates as much. The\nCourt\u2019s lengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, seeante, at 7\u201310, is merely a predicate to asserting that\n\u201ceven if\u201d the Court of Appeals could have considered the report in\nitsJacksonanalysis, the report \u201cprovided no warrant for\nentirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero\u2019s testimony from that\ncourt\u2019s consideration\u201d because the report \u201cdid not contest that the\nDNA evidence matched Troy\u201d or otherwise show that the State\u2019s DNA\nestimates were \u201cunreliable,\u201dante,at 12. Based on these\nobservations, the Court concludes that the Mueller Report did not\nundermine the State\u2019s DNA tests as \u201cpowerful inculpatory evidence.\u201dIbid.That is true, but even if the report had completely\nundermined the DNA evidence\u2014which the Ninth Circuit may have\nmistakenly believed it did, seeBrownv.Farwell,\n525 F.\u00a03d 787, 795\u2013796 (2008)\u2014the panel still would have erred\nin considering the report to resolve respondent\u2019sJacksonclaim. The reason, as the Court reaffirms, is thatJacksonclaims must be decided solely on the evidence adduced at trial. Seeante, at 11. Accordingly, the Court need not correct any\nerroneous impressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning the\nreport\u2019s impact on the State\u2019s DNA evidence to resolve respondent\u2019sJacksonclaim.* Because that is the only claim properly\nbefore us, I do not join the Court\u2019s dicta about how the Mueller\nReport\u2019s findings could affect a constitutional analysis to which\nwe have long held such post-trial evidence does not apply. SeeJackson,supra,at 318.*\u00a0Correcting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s apparent\nmisconception of the effects of the Mueller Report is the only\nplausible reason for the Court\u2019s decision to explain that the\nreport would not have undermined the State\u2019s DNA results \u201ceven if\u201d\nthe Court of Appeals could have considered it in resolving\nrespondent\u2019sJacksonclaim.Ante, at 11\u201312. That\ndiscussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are\ncircumstances in which post-trial evidence would \u201cwarrant\u201d\nexcluding DNA trial evidence from aJacksonanalysis,ante,at 12, or that courts applyingJacksonmay\nconsider post-trial evidence for any other purpose. Both points are\nsquarely foreclosed by the precedents on which the Court relies in\nreversing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment. Seeante, at 1\n(citingJackson, v.Virginia,443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979));ante,at 11 (citingLockhart, v.Nelson,488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988)),\nrespectively.",
