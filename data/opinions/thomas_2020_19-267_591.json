JAMES SCHOOL, PETITIONER19\u2013348v.DARRYL BIEL, as personal representative\nof the ESTATE OF KRISTEN BIELon writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit[July 8, 2020]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring.I agree with the Court that Morrissey-Berru\u2019s\nand Biel\u2019s positions fall within the \u201cministerial\nexception,\u201d[1] because, as\nCatholic school teachers, they are charged with \u201ccarry[ing] out\n[the religious] mission\u201d of the parish schools.Ante, at 21.\nThe Court properly notes that \u201cjudges have no warrant to\nsecond-guess [the schools\u2019] judgment\u201d of who should hold such a\nposition \u201cor to impose their own credentialing requirements.\u201dAnte, at 24. Accordingly, I join the Court\u2019s opinion in\nfull. I write separately, however, to reiterate my view that the\nReligion Clauses require civil courts to defer to religious\norganizations\u2019 good-faith claims that a certain employee\u2019s position\nis \u201cministerial.\u201d SeeHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church\nand Schoolv.EEOC,565 U.S.\n171, 196 (2012) (Thomas, J., concurring).This deference is necessary because, as the\nCourt rightly observes, judges lack the requisite \u201cunderstanding\nand appreciation of the role played by every person who performs a\nparticular role in every religious tradition.\u201dAnte, at 22.\nWhat qualifies as \u201cministerial\u201d is an inherently theological\nquestion, and thus one that cannot be resolved by civil courts\nthrough legal analysis. SeeHosanna-Tabor,supra, at\n197 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Memorial and Remonstrance\nAgainst Religious Assessments, in Selected Writings of James\nMadison 21, 24 (R. Ketcham ed. 2006) (the idea that a \u201cCivil\nMagistrate is a competent Judge of Religious truth\u201d is \u201can arrogant\npretension\u201d that has been \u201cfalsified\u201d). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s\nclaim, judges do not shirk their judicial duty or provide a mere\n\u201crubber stamp\u201d when they defer to a religious organization\u2019s\nsincere beliefs.Post, at 9 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).\nRather, they heed the First Amendment, which \u201ccommands civil courts\nto decide [legal] disputes without resolving underlying\ncontroversies over religious doctrine.\u201dPresbyterian Church in\nU. S.v.Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian\nChurch,393 U.S.\n440, 449 (1969); see alsoante,at 16, n.\u00a010.Moreover, because the application of the\nexception turns on religious beliefs, the duties that a given\nreligious organization will deem \u201cministerial\u201d are sure to vary.\nAlthough the functions recognized as ministerial by the Lutheran\nschool inHosanna-Taborare similar to those considered\nministerial by the Catholic schools here, such overlap will not\nnecessarily exist with other religious organizations, particularly\nthose \u201coutside of the \u2018mainstream.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 565 U.\u00a0S.,at 197 (Thomas, J., concurring). To avoid disadvantaging these\nminority faiths and interfering in \u201ca religious group\u2019s right to\nshape its own faith and mission,\u201did., at 188 (majority\nopinion), courts should defer to a religious organization\u2019s sincere\ndetermination that a position is \u201cministerial.\u201dId., at 197\n(Thomas, J., concurring).The Court\u2019s decision today is a step in the\nright direction. The Court properly declines to consider whether an\nemployee shares the religious organization\u2019s beliefs when\ndetermining whether that employee\u2019s position falls within the\n\u201cministerial exception,\u201d explaining that to \u201cdetermin[e] whether a\nperson is a \u2018co-religionist\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. would risk judicial\nentanglement in religious issues.\u201dAnte, at 26. But the same\ncan be said about the broader inquiry whether an employee\u2019s\nposition is \u201cministerial.\u201d This Court usually goes to great lengths\nto avoid governmental \u201centanglement\u201d with religion, particularly in\nits Establishment Clause cases. See,e.g.,Lemonv.Kurtzman,403 U.S.\n602, 613 (1971).[2] For\nexample, the Court has held that a public school became\nimpermissibly \u201centangle[d]\u201d with religion by simplypermittingstudents to say a prayer before football games\nand overseeing a class election for whom would deliver the prayer.Santa\u00a0Fe Independent School Dist.v.Doe,530 U.S.\n290, 305\u2013307 (2000). And, inLockev.Davey,540 U.S.\n712(2004), the Court concluded that it would violate States\u2019\n\u201cantiestablishment interests\u201d if tax dollars even indirectly\nsupported the education of ministers,id., at 722. But, when\nit comes to the autonomy of religious organizations in our\nministerial-exception cases, these concerns of entanglement have\nnot prevented the Court from weighing in on the theological\nquestions of which positions qualify as \u201cministerial.\u201dAs this Court has explained, the Religion\nClauses do not permit governmental \u201cinterfere[nce] with\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. a religious group\u2019s right to shape its own faith\nand mission through its appointments.\u201dHosanna-Tabor,supra, at 188. To avoid such interference, we should defer\nto these groups\u2019 good-faith understandings of which individuals are\ncharged with carrying out the organizations\u2019 religious\nmissions.Here, the record confirms the sincerity of\npetitioners\u2019 claims that, as lay teachers, Morrissey-Berru and Biel\nheld ministerial roles in these parish schools. For example, the\nOur Lady of Guadalupe Faculty Handbook states that lay teachers\nserve \u201cspecialpastoraladministrative roles .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nin the service of the people of God.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n19\u2013267, p.\u00a052a (emphasis added). Moreover, their \u201cessential\njob duties\u201d include \u201c[m]odeling, teaching of and commitment to\nCatholic religious and moral values.\u201dId., at 55a (boldface\ndeleted); see alsoid., at 32a (Morrissey-Berru\u2019s teaching\ncontract); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013348, p.\u00a096a\n(Biel\u2019s teaching contract). And both Morrissey-Berru\u2019s and Biel\u2019s\nteaching contracts required that their \u201cduties and responsibilities\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. be performed [with an] overriding commitment\u201d to\n\u201cdevelop[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. a Catholic School Faith Community\u201d in\naccordance with \u201cthe doctrines, laws and norms of the Catholic\nChurch.\u201dIbid.; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u2013267,\nat\u00a032a. Finally,amicus curiaeUnited States Conference\nof Catholic Bishops confirms that petitioners\u2019 understanding is\nconsistent with the Church\u2019s view that \u201cCatholic teachers play a\ncritical role\u201d in the Church\u2019s ministry. Brief for United States\nConference of Catholic Bishops 10\u201311; see also Catechism of the\nCatholic Church 8 (2d ed. 2016) (noting that the goal of \u201ceducation\nin the faith of children [is] to initiat[e] the hearers into the\nfullness of Christian life\u201d (emphasis deleted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).The foregoing is more than enough to sustain the\nsincerity of petitioners\u2019 claims that Morrissey-Berru and Biel held\nministerial roles in the parish schools. Their claims thus warrant\nthis Court\u2019s deference and serve as a sufficient basis for applying\nthe ministerial exception.Notes1As the Court\nacknowledges, the term \u201cministerial exception\u201d is somewhat of a\nmisnomer. Seeante, at 11. The First Amendment\u2019s protection\nof religious organizations\u2019 employment decisions is not limited to\nmembers of the clergy or others holding positions akin to that of a\n\u201cminister.\u201dIbid.Rather, as these cases demonstrate, such\nprotection extends to the laity, provided they are entrusted with\ncarrying out the religious mission of the organization.Ante, at 2, 21.2As I have previously\nexplained, this Court\u2019s Establishment Clause jurisprudence \u201cis\nunmoored from the original meaning of the First Amendment.\u201dEspinozav.Montana Dept. of Revenue,ante, at\n2 (concurring opinion). Properly understood, the Establishment\nClause proscribes governmental \u201c\u00a0\u2018coercion of religious\northodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of\npenalty.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAmerican Legionv.American Humanist\nAssn., 588 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 3) (quotingLeev.Weisman,505 U.S.\n577, 640 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).",
