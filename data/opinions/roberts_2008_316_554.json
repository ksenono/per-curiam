    "text": "OPINION OF THE COURTPLAINS COMMERCE BANK V. LONG FAMILY LAND &CATTLE CO.554 U. S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 07-411PLAINS COMMERCE BANK, PETITIONERv.LONG\nFAMILY LAND AND CATTLE COMPANY, INC., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit[June 25, 2008]Chief Justice Roberts delivered\nthe opinion of the Court.This case concerns the sale of\nfee land on a tribal reservation by a non-Indian bank to non-Indian\nindividuals. Following the sale, an Indian couple, customers of the\nbank who had defaulted on their loans, claimed the bank\ndiscriminated against them by offering the land to non-Indians on\nterms more favorable than those the bank offered to them. The\ncouple sued on that claim in tribal court; the bank contested the\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction. The tribal court concluded that it had\njurisdiction and proceeded to hear the case. It ultimately ruled\nagainst the bank and awarded the Indian couple damages and the\nright to purchase a portion of the fee land. The question presented\nis whether the tribal court had jurisdiction to adjudicate a\ndiscrimination claim concerning the non-Indian bank\u2019s sale of fee\nland it owned. We hold that it did not.IThe Long Family Land and Cattle\nCompany, Inc. (Long Company or Company), is a family-run ranching\nand farming operation incorporated under the laws of South Dakota.\nIts lands are located on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian\nReservation. Once a massive, 60-million acre affair, the\nreservation was appreciably diminished by Congress in the 1880s and\nat present consists of roughly 11 million acres located in Dewey\nand Ziebach Counties in north-central South Dakota. The Long\nCompany is a respondent here, along with Ronnie and Lila Long,\nhusband and wife, who together own at least 51 percent of the\nCompany\u2019s shares. Ronnie and Lila Long are both enrolled members of\nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Tribe.The Longs and their Company have\nbeen customers for many years at Plains Commerce Bank (Bank),\nlocated some 25 miles off the reservation as the crow flies in\nHoven, South Dakota. The Bank, like the Long Company, is a South\nDakota corporation, but has no ties to the reservation other than\nits business dealings with tribal members. The Bank made its first\ncommercial loan to the Long Company in 1989, and a series of\nagreements followed. As part of those agreements, Kenneth\nLong\u2014Ronnie Long\u2019s father and a non-Indian\u2014mortgaged to the Bank\n2,230 acres of fee land he owned inside the reservation. At the\ntime of Kenneth Long\u2019s death in the summer of 1995, Kenneth and the\nLong Company owed the Bank $750,000.In the spring of 1996, Ronnie and Lila Long\nbegan negotiating a new loan contract with the Bank in an effort to\nshore up their Company\u2019s flagging financial fortunes and come to\nterms with their outstanding debts. After several months of\nback-and-forth, the parties finally reached an agreement in\nDecember of that year\u2014two agreements, to be precise. The Company\nand the Bank signed a fresh loan contract, according to which\nKenneth Long\u2019s estate deeded over the previously mortgaged fee\nacreage to the Bank in lieu of foreclosure. App. 104. In return,\nthe Bank agreed to cancel some of the Company\u2019s debt and to make\nadditional operating loans. The parties also agreed to a lease\narrangement: The Company received a two-year lease on the 2,230\nacres, deeded over to the Bank, with an option to purchase the land\nat the end of the term for $468,000.Id., at 96\u2013103.It is at this point, the Longs claim, that the\nBank began treating them badly. The Longs say the Bank initially\noffered more favorable purchase terms in the lease agreement,\nallegedly proposing to sell the land back to the Longs with a\n20-year contract for deed. The Bank eventually rescinded that\noffer, the Longs claim, citing \u201c\u00a0\u2018possible jurisdictional\nproblems\u2019\u00a0\u201d that might have been caused by the Bank financing\nan \u201c\u00a0\u2018Indian owned entity on the reservation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d 491 F.\n3d 878, 882 (CA8 2007) (case below).Then came the punishing winter of 1996\u20131997.\nThe Longs lost over 500 head of cattle in the blizzards that\nseason, with the result that the Long Company was unable to\nexercise its option to purchase the leased acreage when the lease\ncontract expired in 1998. Nevertheless, the Longs refused to vacate\nthe property, prompting the Bank to initiate eviction proceedings\nin state court and to petition the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal\nCourt to serve the Longs with a notice to quit. In the meantime,\nthe Bank sold 320 acres of the fee land it owned to a non-Indian\ncouple. In June 1999, while the Longs continued to occupy a\n960-acre parcel of the land, the Bank sold the remaining 1,910\nacres to two other nonmembers.In July 1999, the Longs and the Long Company\nfiled suit against the Bank in the Tribal Court, seeking an\ninjunction to prevent their eviction from the property and to\nreverse the sale of the land. They asserted a variety of claims,\nincluding breach of contract, bad faith, violation of tribal-law\nself-help remedies, and discrimination. The discrimination claim\nalleged that the Bank sold the land to nonmembers on terms more\nfavorable than those offered the Company. The Bank asserted in its\nanswer that the court lacked jurisdiction and also stated a\ncounterclaim. The Tribal Court found that it had jurisdiction,\ndenied the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim,\nand proceeded to trial. Four causes of action were submitted to the\nseven-member jury: breach of contract, bad faith, violation of\nself-help remedies, and discrimination.The jury found for the Longs on three of the\nfour causes, including the discrimination claim, and awarded a\n$750,000 general verdict. After denying the Bank\u2019s post-trial\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict by finding again\nthat it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the Longs\u2019 claims, the\nTribal Court entered judgment awarding the Longs $750,000 plus\ninterest. A later supplemental judgment further awarded the Longs\nan option to purchase the 960 acres of the land they still occupied\non the terms offered in the original purchase option, effectively\nnullifying the Bank\u2019s previous sale of that land to\nnon-Indians.The Bank appealed to the Cheyenne River Sioux\nTribal Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial\ncourt. The Bank then filed the instant action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of South Dakota, seeking a\ndeclaration that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as\nrelevant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019\ndiscrimination claim. The District Court granted summary judgment\nto the Longs. The court found tribal court jurisdiction proper\nbecause the Bank had entered into a consensual relationship with\nthe Longs and the Long Company. 440 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1077\u20131078,\n1080\u20131081 (SD 2006). According to the District Court, this\nrelationship brought the Bank within the first category of tribal\ncivil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined inMontanav.United States,450 U. S. 544(1981).\nSee 440 F. Supp. 2d, at 1077\u20131078.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. 491 F.\u00a03d 878. The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim, the\ncourt held, \u201carose directly from their preexisting commercial\nrelationship with the bank.\u201dId., at 887. When the Bank\nchose to deal with the Longs, it effectively consented to\nsubstantive regulation by the tribe: An antidiscrimination tort\nclaim was just another way of regulating the commercial\ntransactions between the parties. Seeibid.In sum, the\nTribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons who\n\u201cvoluntarily deal with tribal members,\u201d including, here, a\nnonmember\u2019s sale of fee land.Ibid.We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008),\nand now reverse.IIBefore considering the Tribal\nCourt\u2019s authority to adjudicate the discrimination claim, we must\nfirst address the Longs\u2019 contention that the Bank lacks standing to\nraise this jurisdictional challenge in the first place. Though the\nLongs raised their standing argument for the first time before this\nCourt, we bear an independent obligation to assure ourselves that\njurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits. SeeSteel Co. v.Citizens for Better Environment,523 U. S. 83,\n94\u201395 (1998).We begin by noting that whether a\ntribal court has adjudicative authority over nonmembers is a\nfederal question. SeeIowa Mut. Ins. Co.v.LaPlante,480\nU. S. 9, 15 (1987);National Farmers Union Ins. Cos.v.Crow Tribe,471 U. S. 845, 852\u2013853\n(1985). If the tribal court is found to lack such jurisdiction, any\njudgment as to the nonmember is necessarily null and void. The\nLongs do not contest this settled principle but argue instead that\nthe Bank has suffered no \u201cinjury in fact\u201d as required by Article\nIII\u2019s case-or-controversy provision. SeeLujanv.Defenders of Wildlife,504 U. S. 555, 560\n(1992).The Longs appear to recognize their argument\nis somewhat counterintuitive. They concede the jury found the Bank\nguilty of discrimination and awarded them $750,000 plus interest.\nBut the Longs contend the jury\u2019s damages award was in fact premised\nentirely on their breach-of-contract rather than on their\ndiscrimination claim. The Bank does not presently challenge the\nbreach-of-contract verdict.In support of their argument, the Longs point\nto their amended complaint in the Tribal Court. The complaint\ncomprised nine counts. Several of the counts sought damages; the\ndiscrimination count did not. As relief for the discrimination\nclaim, the Longs asked to be granted \u201cpossession and title to their\nland.\u201d App. 173. The Longs contend that the damage award therefore\nhad nothing to do with the discrimination claim. As a result, a\ndecision from this Court finding no jurisdiction with respect to\nthat claim\u2014the only claim the Bank appeals\u2014would not change\nanything.We are not persuaded. The jury verdict form\nconsisted of six special interrogatories, covering each claim\nasserted against the Bank, with another one covering the amount of\ndamages to be awarded.Id.,at 190\u2013192. The damages\ninterrogatory specifically allowed the jury to make an award after\nfinding liability as toanyof the individual claims: \u201cIf\nyou answered yes to Numbers 1, 3, 4,or5 what amount of\ndamages should be awarded to the Plaintiffs?\u201dId., at 192\n(emphasis added). The jury found against the Bank on three of the\nspecial interrogatories, including number 4, the discrimination\nclaim. The Bank, the jurors found, \u201cintentionally discriminate[d]\nagainst the Plaintiffs Ronnie and Lila Long.\u201dId., at 191.\nThe jury then entered an award of $750,000.Id., at 192.\nThese facts establish that the jury could have based its damages\naward, in whole or in part, on the finding of discrimination.There is, in addition, the option to purchase.\nThe Longs argue that requiring the Bank to void the sale to\nnonmembers of a 960\u2013acre parcel and sell that parcel to them\ninstead does not constitute injury-in-fact, because the Tribal\nCourt actuallydeniedthe relief the Longs sought for the\nBank\u2019s discrimination. In its supplemental judgment, the Tribal\nCourt refused to permit the Longs (or the Long Company) to purchase\nall the land\u2014as they had requested\u2014instead granting an option to\npurchase only the 960 acres the Longs occupied at the time. See\nSupplemental Judgment in No. R\u2013120\u201399,Long Family Land &\nCattle Co.v.Maciejewski,(Feb. 18, 2003), App. to\nPet. for Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. Even this partial relief, the Longs\ninsist, was crafted as an equitable remedy for their\nbreach-of-contract claim, see Brief for Respondents 32\u201334, and in\nany event the Bank really suffered no harm, because it would gain\nas much income selling to the Longs as it did selling to the\nnonmembers, seeid., at 34\u201335.These arguments do not defeat the Bank\u2019s\nstanding. The Longs requested, as a remedy for the alleged\ndiscrimination, \u201cpossession and title\u201d to the subject land. App.\n173. They received an option to acquire a portion of exactly that.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201369 to A\u201370. The Tribal Court\u2019s silence\nin its supplemental judgment as to which claim, exactly, the option\nto purchase was meant to remedy is immaterial. Seeibid.Of the four claims presented to the jury, only the discrimination\nclaim sought deed to the land as relief. See Amended Complaint\n(Jan. 3, 2000), App. 158, 173. Nor does the fact that the remedial\npurchase option applied only to a portion of the total parcel\neliminate the Bank\u2019s injury. The Bank had no obligation to sell the\nland to the Longs before the Tribal Court\u2019s judgment\u2014indeed, the\nBank had already sold the acreage to third parties. The Tribal\nCourt judgment effectively nullified a portion of that sale. This\njudicially imposed burden certainly qualifies as an injury for\nstanding purposes. As for the Longs\u2019 speculation that the Bank\nwould make as much money selling the land to them as it did selling\nthe parcel to nonmembers, the argument is entirely beside the\npoint. There is more than adequate injury in being compelled to\nundo one deed and enter into another\u2014particularly with individuals\nwho had previously defaulted on loans.Both with respect to damages and the option to\npurchase, the Bank was injured by the Tribal Court\u2019s exercise of\njurisdiction over the discrimination claim. Those injuries can be\nremedied by a ruling in favor of the Bank that the Tribal Court\nlacked jurisdiction and that its judgment on the discrimination\nclaim is null and void. The ultimate collateral consequence of such\na determination, whatever it may be\u2014vacatur of the general damages\naward, vacatur of the option to purchase, a new trial on the other\nclaims\u2014does not alter the fact that the Bank has shown injury\ntraceable to the challenged action and likely to be redressed by a\nfavorable ruling.Allenv.Wright,468 U. S. 737, 751\n(1984). The Bank has Article III standing to pursue this\nchallenge.IIIAFor nearly two centuries now, we\nhave recognized Indian tribes as \u201cdistinct, independent political\ncommunities,\u201dWorcesterv.Georgia, 6 Pet. 515,\n559 (1832), qualified to exercise many of the powers and\nprerogatives of self-government, seeUnited Statesv.Wheeler,435 U. S. 313, 322\u2013323\n(1978). We have frequently noted, however, that the \u201csovereignty\nthat the Indian tribes retain is of a unique and limited\ncharacter.\u201dId., at 323. It centers on the land held by\nthe tribe and on tribal members within the reservation. SeeUnited Statesv.Mazurie,419 U. S. 544, 557\n(1975) (tribes retain authority to govern \u201cboth their members and\ntheir territory,\u201d subject ultimately to Congress); see alsoNevadav.Hicks,533 U. S. 353, 392\n(2001) (\u201c[T]ribes retain sovereign interests in activities that\noccur on land owned and controlled by the tribe\u201d) (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).As part of their residual\nsovereignty, tribes retain power to legislate and to tax activities\non the reservation, including certain activities by nonmembers, seeKerr-McGee Corp. v.Navajo Tribe,471 U. S. 195, 201\n(1985), to determine tribal membership, seeSanta Clara\nPueblov.Martinez,436 U. S. 49, 55 (1978),\nand to regulate domestic relations among members, seeFisherv.District Courtof Sixteenth\nJudicial Dist. of Mont.,424 U. S. 382, 387\u2013389\n(1976)(per curiam). They may also exclude outsiders from\nentering tribal land. SeeDurov.Reina,495 U. S. 676, 696\u2013697\n(1990). But tribes do not, as a general matter, possess authority\nover non-Indians who come within their borders: \u201c[T]he inherent\nsovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities\nof nonmembers of the tribe.\u201dMontana, at 450 U. S., at\n565. As we explained inOliphantv.Suquamish\nTribe,435 U.\nS. 191(1978), the tribes have, by virtue of their\nincorporation into the American republic, lost \u201cthe right of\ngoverning . . . person[s] within their limits except themselves.\u201dId., at 209 (emphasis and internal quotation marks\nomitted).This general rule restricts tribal authority\nover nonmember activities taking place on the reservation, and is\nparticularly strong when the nonmember\u2019s activity occurs on land\nowned in fee simple by non-Indians\u2014what we have called \u201cnon-Indian\nfee land.\u201dStratev.A\u20131 Contractors,520 U. S. 438, 446\n(1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thanks to the Indian\nGeneral Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7331et seq.,there are millions of acres of\nnon-Indian fee land located within the contiguous borders of Indian\ntribes. SeeAtkinson Trading Co.v.Shirley,532 U. S. 645,\n648, 651, n.\u00a01 (2001). The history of the General Allotment\nAct and its successor statutes has been well rehearsed in our\nprecedents. See,e.g., Montana,supra, at\n558\u2013563;County of Yakimav.Confederated Tribes and\nBands of Yakima Nation,502 U. S. 251, 254\u2013255\n(1992). Suffice it to say here that the effect of the Act was to\nconvert millions of acres of formerly tribal land into fee simple\nparcels, \u201cfully alienable,\u201did.,at 264, and \u201cfree of all\ncharge or encumbrance whatsoever,\u201d 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7348 (2000 ed.,\nSupp. V). See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law\n\u00a716.03[2][b], pp. 1041\u20131042 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).Our cases have made clear that once tribal\nland is converted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary\njurisdiction over it. SeeCounty of Yakima,supra, at 267\u2013268 (General Allotment Act permits Yakima\nCounty to impose ad\u00a0valorem tax on fee land located within the\nreservation);Goudyv.Meath,203 U. S. 146, 140\u2013150\n(1906) (by rendering allotted lands alienable, General Allotment\nAct exposed them to state assessment and forced sale for taxes);In re Heff,197 U. S. 488, 502\u2013503\n(1905) (fee land subject to plenary state jurisdiction upon\nissuance of trust patent (superseded by the Burke Act, 34 Stat.\n182, 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7349) (2000 ed.)). Among the powers lost is\nthe authority to prevent the land\u2019s sale, seeCounty of\nYakima,supra, at 263 (General Allotment Act granted\nfee holders power of voluntary sale)\u2014not surprisingly, as \u201cfree\nalienability\u201d by the holder is a core attribute of the fee simple,\nC. Moynihan, Introduction to Law of Real Property \u00a73, p. 32 (2d ed.\n1988). Moreover, when the tribe or tribal members convey a parcel\nof fee land \u201cto non-Indians, [the tribe] loses any former\nright of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed\nlands.\u201dSouth Dakotav.Bourland,508 U. S. 679, 689\n(1993) (emphasis added). This necessarily entails the \u201cthe loss of\nregulatory jurisdiction over the use of the land by others.\u201dIbid.As a general rule, then, \u201cthe tribe has no authority\nitself, by way of tribal ordinance or actions in the tribal courts,\nto regulate the use of fee land.\u201dBrendalev.Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,492 U. S. 408, 430 (1989) (opinion of\nWhite, J.).We have recognized two exceptions to this\nprinciple, circumstances in which tribes may exercise \u201ccivil\njurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on\nnon-Indian fee lands.\u201dMontana, 450 U. S., at 565. First,\n\u201c[a] tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other\nmeans, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual\nrelationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial\ndealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\u201dIbid.\nSecond, a tribe may exercise \u201ccivil authority over the conduct of\nnon-Indians on fee lands within the reservation when that conduct\nthreatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the\neconomic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\u201dId., at 566. These rules have become known as theMontanaexceptions, after the case that elaborated them.\nBy their terms, the exceptions concern regulation of \u201ctheactivitiesof nonmembers\u201d or \u201ctheconductof\nnon-Indians on fee land.\u201dGivenMontana\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018general\nproposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe\ndo not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,\u2019\u00a0\u201dAtkinson, supra, at 651 (quotingMontana,supra, at 565), efforts by a tribe to regulate nonmembers,\nespecially on non-Indian fee land, are \u201cpresumptively invalid,\u201dAtkinson, supra,at 659. The burden rests on the tribe to\nestablish one of the exceptions toMontana\u2019s general rule\nthat would allow an extension of tribal authority to regulate\nnonmembers on non-Indian fee land.Atkinson,532 U. S., at\n654. These exceptions are \u201climited\u201d ones,id., at 647, and\ncannot be construed in a manner that would \u201cswallow the rule,\u201did., at 655, or \u201cseverely shrink\u201d it,Strate, 520\nU. S., at 458. The Bank contends that neither exception authorizes\ntribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019\ndiscrimination claim at issue in this case. We agree.BAccording to our precedents, \u201ca\ntribe\u2019s adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative\njurisdiction.\u201dId., at 453. We reaffirm that principle\ntoday and hold that the Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the\nLongs\u2019 discrimination claim because the Tribe lacks the civil\nauthority to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of its fee land.The Longs\u2019 discrimination claim\nchallenges a non-Indian\u2019s sale of non-Indian fee land. Despite the\nLongs\u2019 attempt to recharacterize their claim as turning on the\nBank\u2019s alleged \u201cfailure to pay to respondents loans promised for\ncattle-raising on tribal trust land,\u201d Brief for Respondents 47, in\nfact the Longs brought their discrimination claim \u201cseeking to have\nthe land sales set aside on the ground that the sale to nonmembers\n\u2018on terms more favorable\u2019 than the bank had extended to the Longs\u201d\nviolated tribal tort law, 491 F.\u00a03d, at 882 (quoting\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint, App. 173). See also Brief for United\nStates asAmicus Curiae7. That discrimination claim thus\nconcerned the sale of a 2,230-acre fee parcel that the Bank had\nacquired from the estate of a non-Indian.The status of the land is relevant \u201cinsofar as\nit bears on the application of . . .Montana\u2019s exceptions\nto [this] case.\u201dHicks, 533 U. S., at 376 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring). The acres at issue here were alienated from the\nCheyenne River Sioux\u2019s tribal trust and converted into fee simple\nparcels as part of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, commonly\ncalled the 1908 Allotment Act. See Brief for Respondents 4,\nn.\u00a02. While the General Allotment Act provided for the\ndivision of tribal land into fee simple parcels owned by individual\ntribal members, that Act also mandated that such allotments would\nbe held in trust for their owners by the United States for a period\nof 25 years\u2014or longer, at the President\u2019s discretion\u2014during which\ntime the parcel owners had no authority to sell or convey the land.\nSee 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7348 (2000 ed., and Supp. V). The 1908 Act\nreleased particular Indian owners from these restrictions ahead of\nschedule, vesting in them full fee ownership. See \u00a71, 35 Stat. 312.\nIn 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat.\n984, 25 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7461et seq.,which \u201cpu[t] an end to\nfurther allotment of reservation land,\u201d but did not \u201creturn\nallotted land to pre-General Allotment status, leaving it fully\nalienable by the allottees, their heirs, and assigns.\u201dCounty\nof Yakima, 502 U. S., at 264.The tribal tort law the Longs are attempting\nto enforce, however, operates as a restraint on alienation. It\n\u201cset[s] limits on how nonmembers may engage in commercial\ntransactions,\u201d 491 F.\u00a03d, at 887\u2014and not just any\ntransactions, but specifically nonmembers\u2019 sale of fee lands they\nown. It regulates the substantive terms on which the Bank is able\nto offer its fee land for sale. Respondents and their principalamicus, the United States, acknowledge that the tribal\ntort at issue here is a form of regulation. See Brief for\nRespondents 52; Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae25\u201326; see alsoRiegelv.Medtronic, Inc., 552 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11). They argue the regulation is\nfully authorized by the firstMontanaexception. They are\nmistaken.Montanadoes not permit Indian tribes\nto regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.Montanaand\nits progeny permit tribal regulation of nonmemberconductinside the reservation that implicates the tribe\u2019s sovereign\ninterests.Montanaexpressly limits its first exception to\nthe \u201cactivities of nonmembers,\u201d 450 U. S., at 565, allowing these\nto be regulated to the extent necessary \u201cto protect tribal\nself-government [and] to control internal relations,\u201did.,\nat 564. SeeBig Horn Cty. Elect. Cooperative, Inc. v.Adams, 219 F.\u00a03d 944, 951 (CA9 2000)\n(\u201cMontanadoes not grant a tribe unlimited regulatory or\nadjudicative authority over a nonmember. Rather,Montanalimits tribal jurisdiction under the first exception to the\nregulation of theactivitiesof nonmembers\u201d (internal\nquotations omitted; emphasis added)).We cited four cases in explanation ofMontana\u2019s first exception. Each involved regulation of\nnon-Indian activities on the reservation that had a discernable\neffect on the tribe or its members. The first concerned a tribal\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction over a contract dispute arising from the sale\nof merchandise by a non-Indian to an Indian on the reservation. SeeWilliamsv.Lee,358 U. S. 217(1959).\nThe other three involved taxes on economic activity by nonmembers.\nSeeWashingtonv.Confederated Tribes of Colville\nReservation,447 U. S. 134, 152\u2013153\n(1980) (in cases where \u201cthe tribe has a significant interest in the\nsubject matter,\u201d tribes retain \u201cauthority to tax the activities or\nproperty of non-Indians taking place or situated on Indian lands\u201d);Morrisv.Hitchcock,194 U. S. 384, 393\n(1904) (upholding tribal taxes on nonmembers grazing cattle on\nIndian-owned fee land within tribal territory);Busterv.Wright, 135 F. 947, 950 (CA8 1905) (Creek Nation possessed\npower to levy a permit tax on nonmembers for the privilege of doing\nbusiness within the reservation).Our cases sinceMontanahave followed\nthe same pattern, permitting regulation of certain forms of\nnonmember conduct on tribal land. We have upheld as within the\ntribe\u2019s sovereign authority the imposition of a severance tax on\nnatural resources removed by nonmembers from tribal land. SeeMerrionv.Jicarilla Apache Tribe,455 U. S. 130(1982). We\nhave approved tribal taxes imposed on leasehold interests held in\ntribal lands, as well as sales taxes imposed on nonmember\nbusinesses within the reservation. SeeKerr-McGee, 471 U.\nS., at 196\u2013197. We have similarly approved licensing requirements\nfor hunting and fishing on tribal land. SeeNew Mexicov.Mescalero Apache Tribe,462 U. S. 324, 337\n(1983).Tellingly, with only \u201cone minor exception, we\nhave never upheld underMontanathe extension of tribal\ncivil authority over nonmemberson non-Indian land.\u201dHicks,supra,at 360 (emphasis added). SeeAtkinson, 532 U. S., at 659 (Tribe may not tax nonmember\nactivity on non-Indian fee land);Strate, 520 U. S., at\n454, 457 (tribal court lacks jurisdiction over tort suit involving\nan accident on non-tribal land);Montana,supra,\nat 566 (Tribe has no authority to regulate nonmember hunting and\nfishing on non-Indian fee land). The exception isBrendalev.Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,492 U. S. 408, and even it fits the\ngeneral rubric noted above: In that case, we permitted a tribe to\nrestrain particularusesof non-Indian fee land through\nzoning regulations. While a six-Justice majority held thatMontanadidnotauthorize the Yakima Nation to\nimpose zoning regulations on non-Indian fee land located in an area\nof the reservation where nearly half the acreage was owned by\nnonmembers, 492 U. S., at 430\u2013431 (opinion of White, J.);id., at 444\u2013447 (opinion of Stevens, J.), five Justices\nconcluded thatMontanadid permit the Tribe to impose\ndifferent zoning restrictions on nonmember fee land isolated in\n\u201cthe heart of [a] closed portion of the reservation,\u201d 492 U. S., at\n440 (opinion of Stevens, J.), though the Court could not agree on a\nrationale, seeid., at 443\u2013444 (same);id.,at\n458\u2013459 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).But again, whether or not we have permitted\nregulation of nonmember activity on non-Indian fee land in a given\ncase, in no case have we found thatMontanaauthorized a\ntribe to regulate the sale of such land. Rather, ourMontanacases have always concerned nonmember conduct on\nthe land. See,e.g., Hicks,533 U. S., at 359\n(MontanaandStrateconcern \u201ctribal authority to\nregulate nonmembers\u2019activitieson [fee] land\u201d (emphasis\nadded));Atkinson, 532 U. S., at 647 (\u201cconduct of\nnonmembers on non-Indian fee land\u201d);id., at 660 (Souter,\nJ., concurring) (\u201cthe activities of nonmembers);Bourland,\n508 U. S., at 689 (\u201cuse of the land\u201d);Brendale,supra, at 430 (\u201cuse of fee land\u201d);Montana,supra, at 565 (first exception covers \u201cactivities of\nnonmembers\u201d).[Footnote 1]The distinction between sale of the land and\nconduct on it is well-established in our precedent, as the\nforegoing cases demonstrate, and entirely logical given the limited\nnature of tribal sovereignty and the liberty interests of\nnonmembers. By virtue of their incorporation into the United\nStates, the tribe\u2019s sovereign interests are now confined to\nmanaging tribal land, seeWorcester, 6 Pet., at 561\n(persons are allowed to enter Indian land only \u201cwith the assent of\nthe [tribal members] themselves\u201d), \u201cprotect[ing] tribal\nself-government,\u201d and \u201ccontrol[ling] internal relations,\u201d seeMontana,supra, at 564. The logic ofMontanais that certain activities on non-Indian fee land\n(say, a business enterprise employing tribal members) or certain\nuses (say, commercial development) may intrude on the internal\nrelations of the tribe or threaten tribal self-rule. To the extent\nthey do, such activities or land uses may be regulated. SeeHicks,supra, at 361 (\u201cTribal assertion of\nregulatory authority over nonmembers must be connected to that\nright of the Indians to make their own laws and be governed by\nthem\u201d). Put another way, certain forms of nonmember behavior, even\non non-Indian fee land, may sufficiently affect the tribe as to\njustify tribal oversight. While tribes generally have no interest\nin regulating the conduct of nonmembers, then, they may regulate\nnonmember behavior that implicates tribal governance and internal\nrelations.The regulations we have approved underMontanaall flow directly from these limited sovereign\ninterests. The tribe\u2019s \u201ctraditional and undisputed power to exclude\npersons\u201d from tribal land,Duro, 495 U. S., at 696, for\nexample, gives it the power to set conditions on entry to that land\nvia licensing requirements and hunting regulations. SeeBourland,supra, at 691, n. 11 (\u201cRegulatory\nauthority goes hand in hand with the power to exclude\u201d). Much\ntaxation can be justified on a similar basis. SeeColville, 447 U. S., at 153 (taxing power \u201cmay be\nexercised over . . . nonmembers, so far as such nonmembers may\naccept privileges of trade, residence, etc., to which taxes may be\nattached asconditions\u201d (quotingPowers of Indian\nTribes, 55 I.\u00a0D. 14, 46 (1934; emphasis added). The power\nto tax certain nonmember activity can also be justified as \u201ca\nnecessary instrument of self-government and territorial\nmanagement,\u201dMerrion, 455 U. S., at 137, insofar as\ntaxation \u201cenables a tribal government to raise revenues for its\nessential services,\u201d to pay its employees, to provide police\nprotection, and in general to carry out the functions that keep\npeace and order,ibid.Justice Ginsburg wonders why these sorts of\nregulations are permissible underMontanabut regulating\nthe sale of fee land is not. Seepost, at 6\u20137. The reason\nis that regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land, unlike the\nabove, cannot be justified by reference to the tribe\u2019s sovereign\ninterests. By definition, fee land owned by nonmembers has already\nbeen removed from the tribe\u2019s immediate control. SeeStrate, 520 U. S., at 456 (tribes lack power to \u201cassert\n[over non-Indian fee land] a landowner\u2019s right to occupy and\nexclude\u201d). It has already been alienated from the tribal trust. The\ntribe cannot justify regulation of such land\u2019s sale by reference to\nits power to superintend tribal land, then, because non-Indian fee\nparcels have ceased tobetribal land.Nor can regulation of fee land sales be\njustified by the tribe\u2019s interests in protecting internal relations\nand self-government. Any direct harm to its political integrity\nthat the tribe sustains as a result of fee land sale is sustained\nat the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian hands. It is\nat that point the tribe and its members lose the ability to use the\nland for their purposes. Once the land has been sold in fee simple\nto non-Indians and passed beyond the tribe\u2019s immediate control, the\nmere resale of that land works no additional intrusion on tribal\nrelations or self-government. Resale, by itself, causes no\nadditional damage.This is not to suggest that the sale of the\nland will have no impact on the tribe. Theusesto which\nthe land is put may very well change from owner to owner, and those\nuses may well affect the tribe and its members. As our cases bear\nout, seesupra, at 14\u201316, the tribe may quite legitimately\nseek to protect its members from noxious uses that threaten tribal\nwelfare or security, or from nonmember conduct on the land that\ndoes the same. But the key point is that any threat to the tribe\u2019s\nsovereign interests flows from changed uses or nonmember\nactivities, rather than from the mere fact of resale. The tribe is\nable fully to vindicate its sovereign interests in protecting its\nmembers and preserving tribal self-government by regulating\nnonmemberactivityon the land, within the limits set\nforth in our cases. The tribe has no independent interest in\nrestraining alienation of the land itself, and thus, no authority\nto do so.Not only is regulation of fee land sale beyond\nthe tribe\u2019s sovereign powers, it runs the risk of subjecting\nnonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without commensurate\nconsent. Tribal sovereignty, it should be remembered, is \u201ca\nsovereignty outside the basic structure of the Constitution.\u201dUnited Statesv.Lara,541 U. S. 193, 212\n(2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The Bill of Rights\ndoes not apply to Indian tribes. SeeTaltonv.Mayes,163\nU. S. 376, 382\u2013385 (1896). Indian courts \u201cdiffer from\ntraditional American courts in a number of significant respects.\u201dHicks, 533 U. S., at 383 (Souter, J., concurring). And\nnonmembers have no part in tribal government\u2014they have no say in\nthe laws and regulations that govern tribal territory.\nConsequently, those laws and regulations may be fairly imposed on\nnonmembers only if the nonmember has consented, either expressly or\nby his actions. Even then, the regulation must stem from the\ntribe\u2019s inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on entry,\npreserve tribal self-government, or control internal relations. SeeMontana, 450 U. S., at 564.In commenting on the policy goals Congress\nadopted with the General Allotment Act, we noted that \u201c[t]here is\nsimply no suggestion\u201d in the history of the Act \u201cthat Congress\nintended that the non-Indians who would settle upon alienated\nallotted lands would be subject to tribal regulatory authority.\u201dId.,at 560, n.\u00a09. In fact, we said it \u201cdefies common\nsense to suppose\u201d that Congress meant to subject non-Indians to\ntribal jurisdiction simply by virtue of the nonmember\u2019s purchase of\nland in fee simple.Ibid. If Congress did not anticipate\ntribal jurisdiction would run with the land, we see no reason why a\nnonmember would think so either.The Longs point out that the Bank in this case\ncould hardly have been surprised by the Tribe\u2019s assertion of\nregulatory power over the parties\u2019 business dealings. The Bank,\nafter all, had \u201clengthy on-reservation commercial relationships\nwith the Long Company.\u201d Brief for Respondents 40. Justice Ginsburg\nechoes this point. Seepost, at 4. But as we have\nemphasized repeatedly in this context, when it comes to tribal\nregulatory authority, it is not \u201cin for a penny, in for a Pound.\u201dAtkinson, 532 U. S., at 656 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Bank may reasonably have anticipated that its various\ncommercial dealings with the Longs could trigger tribal authority\nto regulate those transactions\u2014a question we need not and do not\ndecide. But there is no reason the Bank should have anticipated\nthat its general business dealings with respondents would permit\nthe Tribe to regulate the Bank\u2019s sale of land it owned in fee\nsimple.Even the courts below recognized that the\nLongs\u2019 discrimination claim was a \u201cnovel\u201d one. 491 F.\u00a03d, at\n892. It arose \u201cdirectly from Lakota tradition as embedded in\nCheyenne River Sioux tradition and custom,\u201d including the Lakota\n\u201csense of justice, fair play and decency to others.\u201d 440\nF.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1082 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nupshot was to require the Bank to offer the same terms of sale to a\nprospective buyer who had defaulted in several previous\ntransactions with the Bank as it offered to a different buyer\nwithout such a history of default. This is surely not a typical\nregulation. But whatever the Bank anticipated, whatever \u201cconsensual\nrelationship\u201d may have been established through the Bank\u2019s dealing\nwith the Longs, the jurisdictional consequences of that\nrelationship cannot extend to the Bank\u2019s subsequent sale of its fee\nland.The Longs acknowledge, if obliquely, the\ncritical importance of land status. They emphasize that the Long\nCompany \u201coperated on reservation fee and trust lands,\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 40, and n. 24, 41, and note that \u201cthe fee land at issue\nin the lease-repurchase agreement\u201d had previously belonged to a\ntribal member,id., at 47. These facts, however, do not\nchange the status of the land at the time of the challenged sale.\nRegardless of where the Long Company operated, the fee land whose\nsale the Longs seek to restrain was owned by the Bank at the\nrelevant time. And indeed, before that, it was owned by Kenneth\nLong, a non-Indian. SeeHicks,supra, at 382,\nn.\u00a04 (Souter,\u00a0J., concurring) (\u201cLand status . . . might\nwell have an impact under one (or perhaps both) of theMontanaexceptions\u201d),Atkinson,supra,\nat 659 (Souter,\u00a0J., concurring) (status of territory as\n\u201ctribal or fee land may have much to do (as it does here) with the\nlikelihood (or not) that facts will exist that are relevant under\nthe [Montana] exceptions\u201d).The Longs attempt to salvage their position by\narguing that the discrimination claim is best read to challenge the\nBank\u2019s whole course of commercial dealings with the Longs\nstretching back over a decade\u2014not just the sale of the fee land.\nBrief for Respondents 44. That argument is unavailing. The Longs\nare the first to point out that their breach-of-contract and\nbad-faith claims, whichdoinvolve the Bank\u2019s course of\ndealings, are not before this Court.Ibid. Only the\ndiscrimination claim is before us and that claim is tied\nspecifically to the sale of the fee land.[Footnote 2]Ibid.Count six of the Longs\u2019\namended complaint in the Tribal Court alleges that \u201c[i]n\nselling the Longs\u2019 land, [Plains Commerce Bank] unfairly\ndiscriminated against the Company and the Longs.\u201d App. 172\u2013173\n(emphasis added). As relief, the Longs claimed they \u201cshould get\npossession and title to their land back.\u201dId., at 173. The\nLongs\u2019 discrimination claim, in short, is an attempt to regulate\nthe terms on which the Bank may sell the land it owns.[Footnote 3]Such regulation is outside the scope of a\ntribe\u2019s sovereign authority. Justice Ginsburg asserts that if\n\u201c[t]he Federal Government and every State, county, and municipality\ncan make nondiscrimination the law governing . . . real property\ntransactions,\u201d tribes should be able to do so as well.Post, at 8. This argument completely overlooks the very\nreason cases likeMontanaand this one arise: Tribal\njurisdiction, unlike the jurisdiction of the other governmental\nentities cited by Justice Ginsburg, generally does not extend to\nnonmembers. SeeMontana,supra, at 565. The\nsovereign authority of Indian tribes is limited in ways state and\nfederal authority is not. Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s\nsuggestion, that bedrock principle does not vary depending on the\ndesirability of a particular regulation.Montanaprovides that, in certain\ncircumstances, tribes may exercise authority over the conduct of\nnonmembers, even if that conduct takes place on non-Indian fee\nland. But conduct taking place on the land and the sale of the land\nare two very different things. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe lost\nthe authority to restrain the sale of fee simple parcels inside\ntheir borders when the land was sold as part of the 1908 Allotment\nAct. Nothing inMontanagives it back.CNeither the District Court nor\nthe Court of Appeals relied for its decision on the secondMontanaexception. The Eighth Circuit declined to address\nthe exception\u2019s applicability, see 491 F. 3d, at 888, n.\u00a07,\nwhile the District Court strongly suggested in passing that the\nsecond exception would not apply here, see 440 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1077. The District Court is correct, for the same reasons we\nexplained above. The secondMontanaexception stems from\nthe same sovereign interests that give rise to the first, interests\nthat do not reach to regulating the sale of non-Indian fee\nland.The second exception authorizes\nthe tribe to exercise civil jurisdiction when non-Indians\u2019\n\u201cconduct\u201d menaces the \u201cpolitical integrity, the economic security,\nor the health or welfare of the tribe.\u201dMontana, 450 U.\nS., at 566. The conduct must do more than injure the tribe, it must\n\u201cimperil the subsistence\u201d of the tribal community.Ibid.\nOne commentator has noted that \u201cth[e] elevated threshold for\napplication of the secondMontanaexception suggests that\ntribal power must be necessary to avert catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nCohen \u00a74.02[3][c], at 232, n. 220.The sale of formerly Indian-owned fee land to\na third party is quite possibly disappointing to the tribe, but\ncannot fairly be called \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for tribal self-government.\nSeeStrate, 520 U. S., at 459. The land in question here\nhas been owned by a non-Indian party for at least 50 years, Brief\nfor Respondents 4, during which time the project of tribal\nself-government has proceeded without interruption. The land\u2019s\nresale to another non-Indian hardly \u201cimperil[s] the subsistence or\nwelfare of the tribe.\u201dMontana,supra, at 566.\nAccordingly, we hold the secondMontanaexception\ninapplicable in this case.DFinally, we address the Longs\u2019\nargument that the Bank consented to tribal court jurisdiction over\nthe discrimination claim by seeking the assistance of tribal courts\nin serving a notice to quit. Brief for Respondents 44\u201346. When the\nLongs refused to vacate the land, the Bank initiated eviction\nproceedings in South Dakota state court. The Bank then asked the\nTribal Court to appoint a process server able to reach the Longs.\nSeeking the Tribal Court\u2019s aid in serving process on tribal members\nfor a pending state-court action does not, we think, constitute\nconsent to future litigation in the Tribal Court. Notably, when the\nLongs did file their complaint against the Bank in Tribal Court,\nthe Bank promptly contended in its answer that the court lacked\njurisdiction. Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae7.\nUnder these circumstances, we find that the Bank did not consent by\nits litigation conduct to tribal court jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019\ndiscrimination claim.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed.It is so ordered.Footnote 1Justice Ginsburg questions this distinction\nbetween sales and activities on the ground that \u201c[s]ales of\nland\u2014and related conduct\u2014are surely \u2018activities\u2019 within the\nordinary sense of the word.\u201dPost, at 6. We think the\ndistinction is readily understandable. In any event, the question\nis not whether a sale is, in some generic sense, an action. The\nquestion is whether land ownership and sale are \u201cactivities\u201d within\nthe meaning ofMontanaand the other cited precedents.Footnote 2Justice Ginsburg contends that if the Tribal\nCourt has jurisdiction over the Longs\u2019 other claims, it is hard to\nunderstand why jurisdiction would not also extend to the\ndiscrimination claim.Post, at 8. First, we have not said\nthe Tribal Court has jurisdiction over the other claims: That\nquestion is not before us and we decline to speculate as to its\nanswer. Moreover, the claims on which the Longs prevailed concern\nbreach of a loan agreement, see App. 190, and bad faith in\nconnection with Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guarantees, seeid., at 192. The present claim involves substantive\nregulation of the sale of fee land.Footnote 3We point to the relief requested by the\nLongs\u2014and partially granted by the Tribal Court\u2014to rebut the Longs\u2019\ncontention that their claim did not focus on the sale of the fee\nland. Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s assertion, however, the nature\nof this remedy does not drive our jurisdictional ruling. Seepost, at 11\u201312. The remedy is invalid because there is no\njurisdiction, not the other way around.",
