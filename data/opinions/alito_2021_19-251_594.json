In particular, I agree that the exacting scrutiny standard\ndrawn from our election-law jurisprudence has real teeth. It\nrequires both narrow tailoring and consideration of alternative\nmeans of obtaining the sought-after information. Seeante,at 9\u201311, 14\u201315 (opinion of the Court). For the reasons The Chief\nJustice explains, California\u2019s blunderbuss approach to charitable\ndisclosures fails exacting scrutiny and is facially\nunconstitutional. Seeante,at 12\u201319 (opinion of the Court).\nThe question is not even close. And for the same reasons,\nCalifornia\u2019s approach necessarily fails strict scrutiny.The Chief Justice would hold that the particular\nexacting scrutiny standard in our election-law jurisprudence\napplies categorically \u201cto First Amendment challenges to compelled\ndisclosure.\u201dAnte, at 7 (plurality opinion). Justice Thomas,\nby contrast, would hold that strict scrutiny applies in all such\ncases. Seeante,at 1\u20132 (concurring opinion). I am not\nprepared at this time to hold that a single standard applies to all\ndisclosure requirements. And I do not read our cases to have\nbroadly resolved the question in favor of exacting scrutiny. This\nCourt decided its seminal compelled disclosure cases before it\ndeveloped modern strict scrutiny doctrine. See Fallon, Strict\nJudicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L.\u00a0Rev. 1267, 1284 (2007) (\u201cBefore\n1960, what we would now call strict judicial scrutiny\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. did not exist\u201d);id., at 1282 (contending\nthat modern strict scrutiny\u2019s \u201cfirst unambiguous appearance\u201d in a\nmajority opinion occurred in 1969). Accordingly, nothing in those\ncases can be understood as rejecting strict scrutiny. If anything,\ntheir language and reasoning\u2014requiring a compelling interest and a\nminimally intrusive means of advancing that interest\u2014anticipated\nand is fully in accord with contemporary strict scrutiny doctrine.\nSee,e.g.,Sheltonv.Tucker,364 U.S.\n479, 488 (1960) (the government\u2019s purpose \u201ccannot be pursued by\nmeans that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the\nend can be more narrowly achieved\u201d);NAACPv.Alabama\nex\u00a0rel. Patterson,357 U.S.\n449, 463 (1958) (requiring a \u201ccompelling\u201d interest (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Similarly,Buckleyv.Valeo,424 U.S. 1(1976) (per curiam), and its progeny should not be read to\nhave broadly cabined our earlier decisions merely by relying on\nthem in one particular context.Because the choice between exacting and strict\nscrutiny has no effect on the decision in these cases, I see no\nneed to decide which standard should be applied here or whether the\nsame level of scrutiny should apply in all cases in which the\ncompelled disclosure of associations is challenged under the First\nAmendment.",
