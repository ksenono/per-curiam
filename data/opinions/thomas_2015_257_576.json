I write separately only to point out, in response to\nthe separate opinion of Justice Kennedy, that the accommodations in\nwhich Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in\nwhich his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos Antonio Zamora,\nand Jose Luis Rositas, now rest. And, given that his victims were\nall 31 years of age or under, Ayala will soon have had as much or\nmore time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to\nenjoy this Earth.",
