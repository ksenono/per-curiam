S. ____ (2008)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 06-1413MEADWESTVACO CORPORATION, successor in in- terest\nto the MEAD CORPORATION, PETITIONERv.ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT\nOF REVENUE et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the appellate court of\nillinois, first district[April 15, 2008]Justice Thomas, concurring.Although I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion, I write separately to express my serious doubt that the\nConstitution permits us to adjudicate cases in this area. Despite\nthe Court\u2019s repeated holdings that \u201c[t]he Due Process and Commerce\nClauses forbid the States to tax \u2018extraterritorial values,\u2019\u00a0\u201dante, at 1 (quotingContainer Corp. of Americav.Franchise Tax Bd.,463 U. S. 159, 164\n(1983)), I am not fully convinced of that proposition.To the extent that our decisions addressing\nstate taxation of multistate enterprises rely on the negative\nCommerce Clause, I would overrule them. As I have previously\nexplained, this Court\u2019s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence \u201chas\nno basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in\npractice.\u201dUnited Haulers Assn., Inc.v.Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op.,\nat 1)).The Court\u2019s cases in this area have not,\nhowever, rested solely on the Commerce Clause. The Court has long\nrecognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nmay also limit States\u2019 authority to tax multistate businesses. SeeAdams Express Co.v.Ohio State Auditor,165 U. S. 194, 226\n(1897) (concluding that because \u201c[t]he property taxed has its\nactual situs in the State and is, therefore, subject to the\njurisdiction, and . . . regulation by the state legislature,\u201d the\ntax at issue did not \u201camoun[t] to a taking of property without due\nprocess of law\u201d). I agree that the Due Process Clause requires a\njurisdictional nexus or, as this Court has stated, \u201csome definite\nlink, some minimum connection, between a state and the person,\nproperty or transaction it seeks to tax.\u201dMiller Brothers\nCo.v.Maryland,347 U. S. 340, 344\u2013345\n(1954); seeante, at 7. But apart from that requirement, I\nam concerned that further constraints\u2014particularly those limiting\nthedegreeto which a State may tax a multistate\nenterprise\u2014require us to read into the Due Process Clause yet\nanother unenumerated, substantive right.Cf.Troxelv.Granville,530 U. S. 57, 80 (2000)\n(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (leaving open the question\nwhether \u201cour substantive due process cases were wrongly decided and\n\u2026 the original understanding of the Due Process Clause precludes\njudicial enforcement of unenumerated rights\u201d).Today the Court applies the additional\nrequirement that there exist \u201ca rational relationship between the\ntax and the values connected with the taxing State.\u201dAnte,\nat 7 (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoMoorman Mfg.\nCo.v.Bair,437 U. S. 267, 273\n(1978) (requiring that \u201cthe income attributed to the State for tax\npurposes . . . be rationally related to \u2018values connected with the\ntaxing State\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quotingNorfolk & Western R. Co.v.Missouri Tax Comm\u2019n,390 U. S. 317, 325\n(1968))). In my view, however, it is difficult to characterize this\nrequirement as providing an exclusively procedural safeguard\nagainst the deprivation of property. Scrutinizing the amount of\nmultistate income a State may apportion for tax purposes comes\nperilously close to evaluating the excessiveness of the State\u2019s\ntaxing scheme\u2014a question the Fourteenth Amendment does not grant us\nthe authority to adjudicate. See,e.g.,Stewart Dry\nGoods Co.v.Lewis,294 U. S. 550, 562\n(1935) (\u201cTo condemn a levy on the sole ground that it is excessive\nwould be to usurp a power vested not in the courts but in the\nlegislature, and to exercise the usurped power arbitrarily by\nsubstituting our conceptions of public policy for those of the\nlegislative body\u201d). Indeed, divining from the Fourteenth Amendment\na right against disproportionate taxation bears a striking\nresemblance to our long-rejectedLochner-era precedents.\nSee,e.g.,Lochnerv.New York,198 U. S. 45, 56\u201358\n(1905) (invalidating a state statute as an \u201cunreasonable,\nunnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the\nindividual \u2026 to enter into those contracts \u2026 which may seem to him\nappropriate or necessary\u201d). Moreover, the Court\u2019s involvement in\nthis area is wholly unnecessary given Congress\u2019 undisputed\nauthority to resolve income apportionment issues by virtue of its\npower to regulate commerce \u201camong the several States.\u201d See U. S.\nConst., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a03.Although I believe that the Court should\nreconsider its constitutional authority to adjudicate these kinds\nof cases, neither party has asked us to do so here, and the Court\u2019s\ndecision today faithfully applies our precedents. I therefore\nconcur.",
