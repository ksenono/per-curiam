BANK N.\u00a0A., et\u00a0al.on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit[June 1, 2020]Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch\njoins, concurring.I agree with the Court\u2019s opinion, which\ncorrectly applies our precedents and concludes that petitioners\nlack standing. I also agree that \u201c[c]ourts sometimes make standing\nlaw more complicated than it needs to be.\u201dAnte, at 8. I\nwrite separately to observe that by requiring us to engage with\npetitioners\u2019 analogies to trust law, our precedents unnecessarily\ncomplicate this case.The historical restrictions on standing provide\na simpler framework. Article III vests \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States\u201d in the federal courts and specifies that it shall\nextend to enumerated categories of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a71, 2. \u201cTo understand the limits that standing imposes on \u2018the\njudicial Power,\u2019 .\u00a0.\u00a0. we must \u2018refer directly to the\ntraditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of common-law\ncourts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSpokeo,Inc.v.Robins, 578\nU.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n2) (quotingHonigv.Doe,484\nU.S. 305, 340 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)); see alsoMuskratv.United States,219\nU.S. 346, 356\u2013357 (1911) (observing that the \u201cjudicial power\nwith the right to determine \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018controversies\u2019\u00a0\u201d has\nlong referred to \u201csuit[s] instituted according to the regular\ncourse of judicial procedure\u201d).\u201cCommon-law courts imposed different limitations\non a plaintiff\u00a0\u2019s right to bring suit depending on the type of\nright the plaintiff sought to vindicate.\u201dSpokeo, 578\nU.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nRights were typically divided into private rights and public\nrights. Private rights are those \u201c\u00a0\u2018belonging to individuals,\nconsidered as individuals.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIbid.(quoting 3 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries *2); see also Woolhandler & Nelson,\nDoes History Defeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L.\u00a0Rev. 689,\n693 (2004). Public rights are \u201cowed \u2018to the whole community,\nconsidered as a community, in its social aggregate\ncapacity.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSpokeo,supra, at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 3) (quoting 4 Blackstone,supra,\nat *5); see also Woolhandler & Nelson,supra, at\n693.Petitioners claim violations of private rights\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\n\u201cIn a suit for the violation of a private right, courts\nhistorically presumed that the plaintiff suffered ade\u00a0factoinjury [if] his personal, legal rights [were]\ninvaded.\u201dSpokeo,supra, at ___ (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring) (slip op., at 2). In this case, however, none of the\nrights identified by petitioners belong to them. The fiduciary\nduties created by ERISA are owed to the plan, not petitioners. See\n29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71104(a)(1), 1105(a), 1106(a)(1), 1106(b),\n1109(a). As participants in a defined benefit plan, petitioners\nhave no legal or equitable ownership interest in the plan assets.\nSeeante, at 4. There has been no assignment of the plan\u2019s\nrights by ERISA or any contract. Seeante, at 5. And\npetitioners cannot rely on ERISA \u00a7502(a). Although it establishes\ncertain causes of action, it creates no private right. See\n\u00a71132(a).There is thus no need to analogize petitioners\u2019\ncomplaint to trust law actions, derivative actions,qui\u00a0tamactions, or anything else. We need only\nrecognize that the private rights that were allegedly violated do\nnot belong to petitioners under ERISA or any contract.Our ERISA precedents have especially complicated\nthe question of standing in this case due to their\nmisinterpretations of the statute. I continue to object to this\nCourt\u2019s practice of using the common law of trusts as the \u201cstarting\npoint\u201d for interpreting ERISA.Varity Corp.v.Howe,516 U.S.\n489, 497 (1996). \u201c[I]n \u2018every case involving construction of a\nstatute,\u2019 the \u2018starting point .\u00a0.\u00a0. is the language\nitself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 528 (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n(quotingErnst & Ernstv.Hochfelder,425 U.S.\n185, 197 (1976); ellipsis in original). This is especially true\nfor ERISA because its \u201cstatutory definition of a fiduciary departs\nfrom the common law.\u201dVarity,supra,at 528.The Court correctly appliesVarityhere, but in an\nappropriate case, we should reconsider our reliance on loose\nanalogies in both our standing and ERISA jurisprudence.",
