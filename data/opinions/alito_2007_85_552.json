S. 220, 258\u2013265\n(2005), a district judge is still required to give significant\nweight to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines. TheBookerremedial decision, however, does not permit a court\nof appeals to treat the Guidelines\u2019 policy decisions as binding. I\nwould not draw a distinction between the Guideline at issue here\nand other Guidelines. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of\nthe Court of Appeals and remand for reconsideration.",
