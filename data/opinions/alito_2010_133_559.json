S. ____ (2010)SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNO. 08-6925CURTIS DARNELL JOHNSON, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATESon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit[March 2, 2010]Justice Alito, with whom JUSTICE\nTHOMAS, joins, dissenting.The Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA) defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201cany\ncrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year \u2026\nthat . . . has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened\nuse ofphysical force against the person of another.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added). The classic definition\nof the crime of battery is the \u201cintentional application of unlawful\nforce against the person of another.\u201dAnte,at 5 (citing\n2\u00a0W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a77.15, p.\n301 (1986 and Supp. 2003); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed.\n2009)). Thus, the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I believe that\nACCA was meant to incorporate this traditional definition, I would\naffirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.IThe Court starts out in the right\ndirection by noting that the critical statutory language\u2014\u201cthe use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014may mean either\n(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is\nsufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery. Seeante, at 4\u20135. The Court veers off course, however, by\nconcluding that the statutory language reaches only violent\nforce.The term \u201cforce,\u201d as the Court\ncorrectly notes, had a well-established meaning at common law that\nincluded even the \u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201dAnte,at\n5. See alsoRespublicav.De Longchamps, 1 Dall.\n111, 114 (O. T. Phila. 1784) (\u201c[T]hough no great bodily pain is\nsuffered by a blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the\ncoat, yet these are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of\nAssault and Battery. . .\u201d); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). This\napproach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent touching (for\nexample, unwanted sexual contact) may be even more injurious than\nthe use of force that is sufficient to inflict physical pain or\ninjury (for example, a sharp slap in the face).When Congress selects statutory language with\na well-known common-law meaning, we generally presume that Congress\nintended to adopt that meaning. See,e.g.,United\nStatesv.Turley,352 U. S. 407, 411\n(1957) (\u201cWe recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without otherwise defining\nit, the general practice is to give that term its common-law\nmeaning\u201d);Morissettev.United States,342 U. S. 246, 263\n(1952);United Statesv.Carll,105 U. S. 611, 612\u2013613\n(1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest that Congress meant the\nphrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d in ACCA to depart from that phrase\u2019s\nmeaning at common law.On the contrary, other standard canons of\nstatutory interpretation point to the same conclusion. \u201c[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute\nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.\u00a0\u201dRussellov.United States,464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014the clause immediately following the clause at\nissue in this case\u2014the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as\nincluding any crime that \u201cinvolves conduct that presentsa\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not include a similar\nlimitation in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should presume that it did not\nintend for such a limitation to apply.The language used by Congress in\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) further illustrates this point. This provision\ncriminalizes, among other things, the possession of a firearm by a\nperson who is subject to a court order that \u201cexplicitly prohibits\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\n[an] intimate partner or childthat would reasonably be\nexpected to cause bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although\n\u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until eight years after\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), seeante, at 9, the former provision is\nnevertheless instructive. If Congress had wanted to include in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to those in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nand \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress could have easily done so\nexpressly.IIThe Court provides two reasons\nfor refusing to interpret 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) in\naccordance with the common-law understanding, but neither is\npersuasive.AThe Court first argues that\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read to refer to \u201cviolent\u201d force because\nthat provision defines the term \u201cviolent felony.\u201dAnte, at\n6. But it is apparent that ACCA uses \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a term of\nart with a wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and extortion are\n\u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we have held that\nACCA also reaches the crime of attempted burglary,Jamesv.United States,550 U. S. 192(2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,[Footnote 1] and it is\ntherefore clear that the use of such force is not a requirement\nunder ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies crimes like burglary and\nextortion as violent felonies because they often lead to violence.\nAs we have put it, these crimes create \u201csignificant risks of \u2026\nconfrontation that might result in bodily injury,\u201did., at\n199, and offensive touching creates just such a risk. For example,\nwhen one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely\nconsequence. SeeUnited Statesv.Velazquez-Overa, 100 F.\u00a03d 418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\u201cIf\nburglary, with its tendency to cause alarm and to provoke physical\nconfrontation, is considered a violent crime under 18 U. S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a716(b), then surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion\nthat occurs when a child is sexually molested\u201d);United\nStatesv.Wood, 52 F.\u00a03d 272, 276 (CA9 1995)\n(same).BThe Court\u2019s only other reason for\nrejecting the common-law definition is the fact that battery at\ncommon law was a misdemeanor. The Court reasons that \u201c[i]t is\nunlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining\n\u2018violent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning\nonly in its definition of a misdemeanor.\u201dAnte,at 7\n(citing 4 Blackstone 216\u2013218 (1769), and ALI, Model Penal Code\n\u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court does not spell out why\nCongress\u2019 selection of this term would be unlikely, but I assume\nthat the Court\u2019s point is that Congress is unlikely to have decided\nto treat as a violent felony an offense that was regarded at common\nlaw as a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the significance\nof the misdemeanor label at common law, the subsequent evolution of\nbattery statutes, and the limitation imposed by 18 U.\u2002S.\u2002C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B).At common law, the terms \u201cfelony\u201d\nand \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d did not have the same meaning as they do today.\nAt that time, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, seeApprendiv.New Jersey,530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7\n(2000); most felonies were punishable by death, seeTennesseev.Garner,471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985);\nand many very serious crimes, such as kidnaping and assault with\nthe intent to murder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. SeeUnited Statesv.Watson,423 U. S. 411, 439\u2013440\n(1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm \u201cfelony\u201d has come to mean any offense punishable by a lengthy\nterm of imprisonment (commonly more than one year, seeBurgessv.United States,553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d has been reserved for minor\noffenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors at common law have\nbeen reclassified as felonies. And when the relevant language in\nACCA was enacted, quite a few States had felony battery statutes\nthat retained the common-law definition of \u201cforce.\u201d See Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police officer a\nfelony); Idaho Code \u00a718\u2013915(c) (Lexis 1987) (same); Ill. Crim. Code\n\u00a712\u20134(b)(6) (1988) (same); La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714:33, 14:43.1 (West\n1986) (sexual battery punishable by more than one year\u2019s\nimprisonment); N.\u00a0M. Stat. Ann. \u00a740A\u201322\u201323 (1972) (battery of\na police officer a felony); see also Kansas Stat. Ann. \u00a721\u20133413(b)\n(Supp. 1994) (simple battery of corrections officers a\nfelony).[Footnote 2]ACCA\u2019s mechanism for identifying the battery\nconvictions that merit treatment as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d is\ncontained in 18 U.\u2002S.\u2002C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), which provides that an\noffense committed by an adult is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d unless it\nis \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d\nConsequently, while all convictions under battery statutes that\ntrack the common-law definition of the offense satisfy the\nrequirements of \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014because they have \u201cas an element\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another\u201d\u2014not all battery convictions qualify as\nconvictions for a violent felony because \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) excludes any\nbattery conviction that was not regarded by the jurisdiction of\nconviction as being sufficiently serious to be punishable by\nimprisonment for more than one year. There is nothing extraordinary\nor unlikely about this approach.IIIThe Court\u2019s interpretation will\nhave untoward consequences. Almost half of the States have statutes\nthat reach both the use of violent force and force that is not\nviolent but is unlawful and offensive.[Footnote 3] Many of the States classify these batteries as\nfelonies or make them punishable by imprisonment for more than one\nyear.[Footnote 4] Although the\ngreat majority of convictions under these statutes are, no doubt,\nbased on the use of violent force, the effect of the Court\u2019s\ndecision will be to take all these convictions outside the scope of\nACCA\u2014unless the Government is able to produce documents that may\nproperly be consulted under the modified categorical approach and\nthat conclusively show that the offender\u2019s conduct involved the use\nof violent force, seeante,at 10\u201311. As the Government\nnotes, however, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both the use of\nviolent force and offensive touching, charging documents frequently\nsimply track the language of the statute, and jury instructions\noften do not require juries to draw distinctions based on the type\nof force that the defendant employed. See Brief for United States\n42\u201343.In addition, the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of the term \u201cphysical force\u201d may hobble at least two\nfederal statutes that contain this identical term. Under 18 U.\nS.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence\u201d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and the\nterm \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is defined as\napplying only to crimes that \u201cha[ve], as an element, the use or\nattempted use ofphysical force, or the threatened use of\na deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (emphasis added). As we recently\nexplained, Congress recognized that \u201c\u00a0\u2018many people who engage\nin serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with\nor convicted of felonies,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and Congress therefore enacted\nthis provision to keep firearms out of the hands of such abusers.United Statesv.Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 10). Cases of spousal and child abuse are frequently\nprosecuted under generally applicable assault and battery statutes,ibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of\nalmost half the States apply both to cases involving the use of\nviolent force and cases involving offensive touching. As a result,\nif the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysical force\u201d in ACCA\nis applied to \u00a7922(g)(9), a great many persons convicted for\nserious spousal or child abuse will be allowed to possess\nfirearms.Under 8 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E), an alien\nconvicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is subject to removal,\nand the term \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is defined as an offense\nthat, among other things, has \u201cas an element the use [or] attempted\nuse \u2026 of physical force.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a). Accordingly, if\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysical force\u201d is applied\nto this provision, many convicted spousal and child abusers will\nescape removal, a result that Congress is unlikely to have\nintended.*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*For all these reasons, I believe\nthat the Court\u2019s decision is incorrect, and I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.Footnote 1For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined\nas \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a\nbuilding or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201dTaylorv.United States,495 U. S. 575, 598\n(1990). See alsoJames, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202\u2013203\n(attempted burglary under Florida law requires \u201covert conduct\ndirected toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling,\nwith the intent to commit a felony therein\u201d and that the \u201cdefendant\nfail in the perpetration or be intercepted or prevented in the\nexecution of the underlying offense\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Although we have not defined extortion under ACCA, the\nHobbs Act defines it as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another,\nwith his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened\nforce, violence, orfear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see alsoJames, supra,at 223\u2013224 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n(defining extortion in ACCA as \u201cthe obtaining of something of value\nfrom another, with his consent, induced by the wrongful use or\nthreatened use of force against the personor property of\nanother\u201d (emphasis added)).Footnote 2These state statutes show that Congress, by\nusing a term of art, \u201cforce,\u201d did not adopt a meaning \u201cpeculiar . .\n.
