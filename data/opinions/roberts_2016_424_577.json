Because parts of the river\nare shallow and difficult to navigate, Sturgeon travels by\nhovercraft, an amphibious vehicle capable of gliding over land and\nwater. To reach his preferred hunting grounds, Sturgeon must pilot\nhis hovercraft over a stretch of the Nation River that flows\nthrough the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, a 1.7 million\nacre federal preservation area managed by the National Park\nService. 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7410hh(10).Alaska law permits the use of hovercraft.\nNational Park Service regulations do not. See 36 CFR \u00a72.17(e)\n(2015). After Park Service rangers informed Sturgeon that he was\nprohibited from using his hovercraft within the boundaries of the\npreserve, Sturgeon filed suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief. He argues that the Nation River is owned by the State, and\nthat the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)\nprohibits the Park Service from enforcing its regulations on\nstate-owned land in Alaska. The Park Service disagrees, contending\nthat it has authority to regulate waters flowing through federally\nmanaged preservation areas. The District Court and the Court of\nAppeals ruled in favor of the Park Service. We granted\ncertiorari.IIn 1867, Secretary of State William Seward,\nserving under President Andrew Johnson, negotiated a treaty to\npurchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. Treaty Concerning the\nCession of the Russian Possessions in North America, Mar. 30, 1867,\n15Stat. 539. In a single stroke, the United States gained 365\nmillion acres of land\u2014an area more than twice the size of Texas.\nDespite the bargain price of two cents an acre, however, the\npurchase was mocked by contemporaries as \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d and\nPresident Johnson\u2019s \u201cPolar Bear Garden.\u201d See C. Naske & H.\nSlotnick, Alaska: A History 92\u201394 (2011) (Naske & Slotnick); S.\nRep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1957).The monikers didn\u2019t stick. In 1898, the \u201cThree\nLucky Swedes\u201d\u2014Jafet Lindeberg, Eric Lindblom, and Jon\nBrynteson\u2014struck gold in Nome, Alaska. As word of their discovery\nspread, thousands traveled to Alaska to try their hand at mining.\nOnce the gold rush subsided, settlers turned to other types of\nmining, fishing, and trapping, fueling an emerging export economy.\nSee Naske & Slotnick 128\u2013129, 155, 249\u2013251; D. Wharton, The\nAlaska Gold Rush 186\u2013187 (1972).Despite newfound recognition of Alaska\u2019s\neconomic potential, however, it was not until the 1950\u2019s that\nCongress seriously considered admitting Alaska as a State. By that\ntime, it was clear that Alaska was strategically important both in\nthe Pacific and Arctic, and that the Territory was rich in natural\nresources, including oil. Moreover, the people of Alaska favored\nstatehood. See Naske & Slotnick 201, 224\u2013235. But there was a\nproblem: Out of the 365 million acres of land in Alaska, 98 percent\nwere owned by the Federal Government. As a result, absent a land\ngrant from the Federal Government to the State, there would be\nlittle land available to drive private economic activity and\ncontribute to the state tax base. See S. Rep. No. 1163, at 2, 12\n(\u201cThe expenses of the State of Alaska will be comparatively high,\npartially due to the vast land areas within the State; but the\nState would be able to realize revenues from only 2 percent of this\nvast area unless some provision were made to modify the present\nland-ownership conditions\u201d).A solution was struck. The 1958 Alaska Statehood\nAct permitted Alaska to select 103 million acres of \u201cvacant,\nunappropriated, and unreserved\u201d federal land\u2014just over a quarter of\nall land in Alaska\u2014for state ownership. \u00a7\u00a76(a)\u2013(b), 72Stat. 340.\nThat land grant included \u201cmineral deposits,\u201d which were \u201csubject to\nlease by the State as the State legislature may direct.\u201d \u00a76(i),id., at 342. Upon statehood, Alaska also gained \u201ctitle to\nand ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters\u201d within the\nState, in addition to \u201cthe natural resources within such lands and\nwaters,\u201d including \u201cthe right and power to manage, administer,\nlease, develop, and use the said lands and natural resources.\u201d\n\u00a73(a), 67Stat. 30, 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311(a); \u00a76(m), 72Stat.\n343. With over 100 million acres of land now available to the new\nState, Alaska could begin to fulfill its state policy \u201cto encourage\nthe settlement of its land and the development of its resources by\nmaking them available for maximum use consistent with the public\ninterest.\u201d Alaska Const., Art. VIII, \u00a71 (2014).The Statehood Act did not, however, determine\nthe rights of the Alaska Natives, who asserted aboriginal title to\nmuch of the same land now claimed by the State. Naske &\nSlotnick 287\u2013289. To resolve the dispute, Congress in 1971 passed\nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which extinguished\naboriginal land claims in Alaska. 85Stat. 688, as amended, 43\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71601et\u00a0seq.In exchange, Congress\nprovided for a $960 million settlement and permitted corporations\norganized by groups of Alaska Natives to select 40 million acres of\nfederal land to manage within the State. \u00a7\u00a71605, 1610\u20131615; Naske\n& Slotnick 296\u2013297. Congress sought to implement the settlement\n\u201crapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the real economic and\nsocial needs\u201d of Alaska Natives. \u00a71601(b).In addition to settling the claims of the Alaska\nNatives, ANCSA directed the Secretary of the Interior to select up\nto 80 million acres of unreserved federal land in Alaska for\naddition to the National Park, Forest, Wildlife Refuge, and Wild\nand Scenic Rivers Systems, subject to congressional approval.\n\u00a71616(d)(2). When Congress failed to approve the Secretary\u2019s\nselections, however, President Carter unilaterally designated 56\nmillion acres of federal land in Alaska as national monuments. See\nPresidential Proclamation Nos. 4611\u20134627, 3 CFR 69\u2013104 (1978\nComp.).President Carter\u2019s actions were unpopular among\nmany Alaskans, who were concerned that the new monuments would be\nsubject to restrictive federal regulations. Protesters demonstrated\nin Fairbanks, and more than 2,500 Alaskans participated in the\n\u201cGreat Denali-McKinley Trespass.\u201d The goal of the trespass was to\nbreak over 25 Park Service rules in a two-day period\u2014including by\ncamping, hunting, snowmobiling, setting campfires, shooting guns,\nand unleashing dogs. During the event, a \u201crider on horseback,\nacting the part of Paul Revere, galloped through the crowd yelling,\n\u2018The Feds are coming! The Feds are coming!\u2019\u00a0\u201d N.\u00a0Y.\nTimes, Jan. 15, 1979, p. A8; Anchorage Daily News, Jan. 15, 1979,\npp.\u00a01\u20132.Congress once again stepped in to settle the\ncontroversy, passing the Alaska National Interest Lands\nConservation Act. 94Stat. 2371, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101et\u00a0seq.ANILCA had two stated goals: First, to provide\n\u201csufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic,\nnatural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in\nAlaska.\u201d \u00a73101(d). And second, to provide \u201cadequate opportunity for\nsatisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of\nAlaska and its people.\u201dIbid.ANILCA set aside 104 million acres of land in\nAlaska for preservation purposes, in the process creating ten new\nnational parks, preserves, and monuments\u2014including the\nYukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve\u2014and tripling the number of\nacres set aside in the United States for federal wilderness\npreservation. See \u00a7410hh; Naske & Slotnick 315\u2013316. At the same\ntime, ANILCA specified that the Park Service could not prohibit on\nthose lands certain activities of particular importance to\nAlaskans. See,e.g.,\u00a73170(a) (Secretary must permit\nreasonable use of vehicles \u201cfor travel to and from villages and\nhomesites\u201d); \u00a73201 (Secretary must permit \u201cthe taking of fish and\nwildlife for sport purposes and subsistence uses\u201d within National\nPreserves in Alaska, subject to regulation and certain exceptions).\nPresident Carter\u2019s earlier land designations were rescinded. See\n\u00a73209(a).Under ANILCA, federal preservation lands in\nAlaska were placed into \u201cconservation system units,\u201d which were\ndefined to include \u201cany unit in Alaska of the National Park System,\nNational Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers\nSystems, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation\nSystem, or a National Forest Monument.\u201d \u00a73102(4). Congress drew the\nbound-aries of those units to \u201cfollow hydrographic divides or\nem-brace other topographic or natural features,\u201d however, rather\nthan to map the Federal Government\u2019s landholdings. \u00a73103(b). As a\nconsequence, in addition to federal land, over 18 million acres of\nstate, Native Corporation, and private land ended up inside the\nboundaries of conservation system units. See Brief for Petitioner\n6.This brings us back to Sturgeon and his\nhovercraft.IIAOne fall day in 2007, Sturgeon was piloting\nhis hovercraft on the Nation River, which rises in the Ogilvie\nMountains in Canada and joins the Yukon River within the boundaries\nof the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve conservation system\nunit (Yukon-Charley). Sturgeon was headed to a hunting ground\nupstream from the preserve, just shy of the Canadian border. To\nreach that hunting ground, dubbed \u201cmoose meadows,\u201d Sturgeon had to\ntravel on a portion of the river that flows through the\npreserve.About two miles into his trip on the Nation\nRiver, Sturgeon stopped on a gravel bar to repair the steering\ncable of his hovercraft. As he was performing the repairs, Sturgeon\nwas approached by three Park Service rangers. The rangers informed\nhim that hovercraft were prohibited under Park Service regulations,\nand that he was committing a crime by operating his hovercraft\nwithin the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley. Despite Sturgeon\u2019s\nprotests that Park Service regulations did not apply because the\nriver was owned by the State of Alaska, the rangers ordered\nSturgeon to remove his hovercraft from the preserve. Sturgeon\ncomplied, heading home without a moose.Sturgeon now fears that he will be criminally\nprosecuted if he returns to hunt along the Nation River in his\nhovercraft. To avoid prosecution, Sturgeon sued the Park Service\nand several federal officials in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Alaska. He seeks declaratory and injunctive\nrelief permitting him to operate his hovercraft within the\nboundaries of the Yukon-Charley. Alaska intervened in support of\nSturgeon, and the Park Service opposed the suit.The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe Park Service.Sturgeonv.Masica, 2013 WL 5888230\n(Oct. 30, 2013). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed in pertinent part.Sturgeonv.Masica, 768\nF.\u00a03d 1066 (2014).We granted certiorari. 576 U.\u00a0S. ___\n(2015).BThe Secretary of the Interior has authority to\n\u201cprescribe regulations\u201d concerning \u201cboating and other activities on\nor relating to water located within System units, including water\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 54\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100751(b) (2012 ed., Supp. II). \u201cSystem units\u201d\nare in turn defined as \u201cany area of land and water administered by\nthe Secretary, acting through the Director [of the Park Service],\nfor park, monument, historic, parkway, recreational, or other\npurposes.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7100102, 100501.The Park Service\u2019s hovercraft regulation was\nadopted pursuant to Section 100751(b). The hovercraft ban applies\nnot only within \u201c[t]he boundaries of federally owned lands and\nwaters administered by the National Park Service,\u201d but also to\n\u201c[w]aters subject to the jurisdiction of theUnited States located\nwithin the boundaries of the National Park System, including\nnavigable waters .\u00a0.\u00a0. withoutregard to the ownership of\nsubmerged lands.\u201d 36 CFR \u00a71.2(a). The hovercraft ban is not limited\nto Alaska, but instead has effect in federally managed preservation\nareas across the country.Section 103(c) of ANILCA, in contrast, addresses\nthe scope of the Park Service\u2019s authority over lands within the\nboundaries of conservation system units in Alaska. The first\nsentence of Section 103(c) specifies the property included as a\nportion of those units. It states: \u201cOnly those lands within the\nboundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands\n(as such term is defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be\nincluded as a portion of such unit.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73103(c). ANILCA defines the word \u201cland\u201d to include \u201clands, waters,\nand interests therein,\u201d and the term \u201cpublic lands\u201d to include\n\u201clands the title to which is in the United States after December 2,\n1980,\u201d with certain exceptions. \u00a73102. In sum, only \u201clands, waters,\nand interests therein\u201d to which the United States has \u201ctitle\u201d are\nconsidered \u201cpublic\u201d land \u201cincluded as a portion\u201d of the\nconservation system units in Alaska.The second sentence of Section 103(c) concerns\nthe Park Service\u2019s authority to regulate \u201cnon-public\u201d lands in\nAlaska, which include state, Native Corporation, and private\nproperty. It provides: \u201cNo lands which, before, on, or after\nDecember 2, 1980, are conveyed to the State, to any Native\nCorporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the\nregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.\u201d\n\u00a73103(c).The third sentence of Section 103(c) explains\nhow new lands become part of conservation system units: \u201cIf the\nState, a Native Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any\nsuch lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with\napplicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall\nbecome part of the unit, and be administered accordingly.\u201dIbid.CThe parties dispute whether Section 103(c) of\nANILCA created an Alaska-specific exception to the Park Service\u2019s\ngeneral authority over boating and related activities in federally\nmanaged preservation areas. Sturgeon, the Park Service, and the\nNinth Circuit each adopt a different reading of Section 103(c),\nreaching different conclusions about the scope of the Park\nService\u2019s powers.Sturgeon, joined by the State, understands\nSection 103(c) to stand for a simple proposition: The Park Service\nis prohibited from regulating \u201cnon-public\u201d land in Alaska as if\nthat land were owned by the Federal Government. He contends that\nhis reading is consistent with the history of federal land\nmanagement in Alaska, beginning with the Alaska Statehood Act and\nculminating in ANILCA.Sturgeon\u2019s argument proceeds in two steps.\nFirst, he asserts that the Nation River is not \u201cpublic land\u201d for\npurposes of ANILCA and is therefore not part of the Yukon-Charley.\nAs discussed, ANILCA defines \u201cpublic lands\u201d as lands to which the\nUnited States has \u201ctitle.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102. And Section\n103(c) provides that \u201c[o]nly those lands within the boundaries of\nany conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term\nis defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion\nof such unit.\u201d \u00a73103(c).Sturgeon argues that the Nation River is not\n\u201cpublic land\u201d because it is owned by the State and not by the\nFederal Government. To support his argument, Sturgeon relies on the\nAlaska Statehood Act, which granted ownership of the submerged\nlands beneath the navigable waters in Alaska, and the resources\nwithin those waters, to the State. See \u00a76(m), 72Stat. 343; 43\nU.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311(a). He also cites this Court\u2019s decision inUnited Statesv.California, 436 U.\u00a0S. 32 (1978)\n, which stated that \u201cthe Submerged Lands Act transferred title to\nand ownership of the submerged lands and waters\u201d to the States.Id., at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the\nState and not the Federal Government owns the Nation River,\nSturgeon urges, it is not \u201cpublic\u201d land under ANILCA and is\ntherefore not part of the Yukon-Charley.Second, Sturgeon asserts that because the Nation\nRiver is not part of the Yukon-Charley, the Park Service lacks\nauthority to regulate it. His argument rests on the second sentence\nof Section 103(c), which states that \u201c[n]o lands which, before, on,\nor after December 2, 1980, are conveyed to the State, to any Native\nCorporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the\nregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.\u201d\n16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).Sturgeon argues that the phrase \u201cregulations\napplicable solely to public lands within such units\u201d refers to\nthose regulations that apply \u201csolely\u201d by virtue of the Park\nService\u2019s \u201cauthority to manage national parks.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 18, 26\u201327. The word \u201csolely,\u201d Sturgeon contends, simply\nensures that \u201cnon-public\u201d lands within the boundaries of those\nunits remain subject to laws generally \u201capplicable to both public\nand private lands (such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act).\u201dId., at 19. Because the hovercraft regulation was adopted\npursuant to the Park Service\u2019s authority over federally managed\npreservation areas, and is not a law of general applicability like\nthe Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, Sturgeon concludes that\nSection 103(c) bars enforcement of the regulation.The Park Service, in contrast, reads Section\n103(c) more narrowly. In its brief in this Court, the Park Service,\nwhile defending the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, relies\nprimarily on very different arguments. The agency stresses that it\nhas longstanding authority to regulate waters within federally\nmanaged preservation areas, and that Section 103(c) does not take\nany of that authority away. In reaching its conclusion, the Park\nService disagrees with Sturgeon at each step.First, the Park Service contends that the Nation\nRiver is part of the Yukon-Charley. To support that contention, the\nagency cites ANILCA\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic lands,\u201d which\u2014as\nnoted\u2014includes \u201clands, waters, and interests therein\u201d to which the\nUnited States has \u201ctitle.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102. The Park\nService argues that the United States has \u201ctitle\u201d to an \u201cinterest\u201d\nin the water within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley under the\nreserved water rights doctrine.The reserved water rights doctrine specifies\nthat \u201cwhen the Federal Government withdraws its land from the\npublic domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the\nGovernment, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then\nunappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of\nthe reservation.\u201dCappaertv.United States, 426\nU.\u00a0S. 128, 138 (1976) . By creating the Yukon-Charley, the\nPark Service urges, the Federal Government reserved the water\nwithin the boundaries of the conservation system unit to achieve\nthe Government\u2019s conservation goals. As a result, the Federal\nGovernment has \u201ctitle\u201d to an \u201cinterest\u201d in the Nation River, making\nit \u201cpublic\u201d land subject to Park Service regulations.Second, the Park Service contends that even if\nthe Nation River is not \u201cpublic\u201d land, the agency still has\nauthority to regulate it. According to the Park Service, the second\nsentence of Section 103(c) imposes only a limited restriction on\nthe agency\u2019s power, prohibiting it from enforcing on \u201cnon-public\u201d\nlands only those regulations that explicitly apply \u201csolely to\npublic lands.\u201d The hovercraft regulation applies both within \u201c[t]he\nboundaries of feder-ally owned lands and waters administered by the\nNational Park Service\u201dandto \u201c[w]aters subject to the\njurisdiction of the United States located within the boundaries of\nthe National Park System, including navigable waters\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. without regard to the ownership of submerged\nlands.\u201d 36 CFR \u00a71.2(a). Accordingly, the Park Service asserts, the\nhovercraft regulation does not apply \u201csolely to public lands,\u201d and\nSection 103(c) therefore does not prevent enforcement of the\nregulation. See Brief for Respondents 56\u201358.The Ninth Circuit, for its part, adopted a\nreading of Section 103(c) different from the primary argument\nadvanced by the Park Service in this Court. The Court of Appeals\ndid not reach the question whether the Nation River counts as\n\u201cpublic\u201d land for purposes of ANILCA. Instead, it held that the\nphrase \u201cregulations applicable solely to public lands within such\nunits\u201d distinguishes between Park Service regulations that apply\nsolely to \u201cpublic\u201d landsin Alaska, and Park Service\nregulations that apply to federally managed preservation areas\nacross the country. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, the Park Service\nmay enforce nationally applicable regulations on both \u201cpublic\u201d and\n\u201cnon-public\u201d property within the boundaries of conservation system\nunits in Alaska, because such regulations do not apply \u201csolely to\npublic lands within such units.\u201d The Park Service may not, however,\napply Alaska-specific regulations to \u201cnon-public\u201d lands within the\nboundaries of those units.According to the Ninth Circuit, because the\nhovercraft regulation \u201capplies to all federal-owned lands and\nwaters administered by [the Park Service] nationwide, as well as\nall navigable waters lying within national parks,\u201d the hovercraft\nban does not apply \u201csolely\u201d within conservation system units in\nAlaska. 768 F.\u00a03d, at 1077. The Ninth Circuit concluded that\nthe Park Service therefore has authority to enforce its hovercraft\nregulation on the Nation River.Id., at 1078. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s holding is subject to some interpretation, but Sturgeon,\nthe State, the Alaska Native Corporations, and the Park Service (at\nleast at times) concur in our understanding of the decision below.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 25; Brief for State of Alaska asAmicus\nCuriae23; Brief for Arctic Slope Regional Corporation\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae12\u201313; Brief for Doyon, Ltd.,\net\u00a0al. asAmici Curiae31\u201332; Brief for Respondents 20;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 61; 80 Fed. Reg. 65573 (2015).IIIWe reject the interpretation of Section 103(c)\nadopted by the Ninth Circuit. The court\u2019s reading of the phrase\n\u201cregulations applicable solely to public lands within such units\u201d\nmay be plausible in the abstract, but it is ultimately inconsistent\nwith both the text and context of the statute as a whole. Statutory\nlanguage \u201ccannot be construed in a vacuum. It is a fundamental\ncanon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be\nread in their context and with a view to their place in the overall\nstatutory scheme.\u201dRobertsv.Sea-Land Services,\nInc., 566 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).Under the reading of the statute adopted below,\nthe Park Service may apply nationally applicable regulations to\n\u201cnon-public\u201d lands within the boundaries of conservation system\nunits in Alaska, but it may not apply Alaska-specific regulations\nto those lands. That is a surprising conclusion. ANILCA repeatedly\nrecognizes that Alaska is different\u2014from its \u201cunrivaled scenic and\ngeological values,\u201d to the \u201cunique\u201d situation of its \u201crural\nresidents dependent on subsistence uses,\u201d to \u201cthe need for\ndevelopment and use of Arctic resources with appropriate\nrecognition and consideration given to the unique nature of the\nArctic environment.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73101(b), 3111(2),\n3147(b)(5).ANILCA itself accordingly carves out numerous\nAlaska-specific exceptions to the Park Service\u2019s general authority\nover federally managed preservation areas. For example, ANILCA\nrequires the Secretary of the Interior to permit \u201cthe exercise of\nvalid commercial fishing rights or privi-leges\u201d within the National\nWildlife Refuge System in Alaska, including the use of \u201ccampsites,\ncabins, motorized vehicles, and aircraft landings directly incident\nto the exercise of such rights or privileges,\u201d with certain\nexceptions. 94Stat. 2393. ANILCA also requires the Secretary to\n\u201cpermit on the public lands appropriate use for subsistence\npurposes of snowmobiles, motorboats, and other means of surface\ntransportation traditionally employed for such purposes by local\nresidents, subject to reasonable regulation.\u201d 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\n\u00a73121(b). And it provides that National Preserves \u201cin Alaska shall\nbe administered and managed as a unit of the National Park System\nin the same manner as a national parkexceptas otherwise\nprovided in this Act andexceptthat the taking of fish and\nwildlife for sport purposes and subsistence uses, and trapping\nshall be allowed\u201d pursuant to applicable law. \u00a73201 (emphasis\nadded).Many similar examples are woven throughout\nANILCA. See,e.g.,94Stat. 2393 (Secretary must administer\nwildlife refuge \u201cso as to not impede the passage of navigation and\naccess by boat on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers,\u201d subject to\nreasonable regulation);id., at 2388 (Secretary must allow\nreindeer grazing uses in certain areas, including construction of\nnecessary facilities); 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73203(a)\n(Alaska-specific rules for wilderness management apply \u201cin\nrecognition of the unique conditions in Alaska\u201d); \u00a73170(a)\n(Secretary must permit reasonable use of snowmachines, motorboats,\nand airplanes within conserva-tion system units \u201cfor travel to and\nfrom villages and homesites\u201d).All those Alaska-specific provisions reflect the\nsimple truth that Alaska is often the exception, not the rule. Yet\nthe reading below would prevent the Park Service from recognizing\nAlaska\u2019s unique conditions. Under that reading, the Park Service\ncould regulate \u201cnon-public\u201d lands in Alaska only through rules\napplicableoutsideAlaska as well. Thus, for example, if the\nPark Service elected to allow hovercraft during hunting season in\nAlaska\u2014in a departure from its nationwide rule\u2014the more relaxed\nregulation would apply only to the \u201cpublic\u201d land within the\nboundaries of the unit. Hovercraft would still be banned from the\n\u201cnon-public\u201d land, even during hunting season. Whatever the reach\nof the Park Service\u2019s authority under ANILCA, we cannot conclude\nthat Section 103(c) adopted such a topsy-turvy approach.Moreover, it is clear that Section 103(c) draws\na distinction between \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cnon-public\u201d lands within the\nboundaries of conservation system units in Alaska. See \u00a73103(c)\n(\u201cOnly those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system\nunit which are public lands .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be deemed to be\nincluded as a portion of such unit\u201d);ibid.(No lands\n\u201cconveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any\nprivate party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely\nto public lands within such units\u201d). And yet, according to the\ncourt below, if the Park Service wanted to differentiate between\nthat \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cnon-public\u201d land in an Alaska-specific way, it\nwould have to regulate the \u201cnon-public\u201d land pursuant to rules\napplicable outside Alaska, and the \u201cpublic\u201d land pursuant to\nAlaska-specific provisions. Assuming the Park Service has authority\nover \u201cnon-public\u201d land in Alaska (an issue we do not decide), that\nstrikes us as an implausible reading of the statute.Looking at ANILCA both as a whole and with\nrespect to Section 103(c), the Act contemplates the possibility\nthat all the land within the boundaries of conservation system\nunits in Alaska may be treated differently from federally managed\npreservation areas across the country, and that \u201cnon-public\u201d lands\nwithin the boundaries of those units may be treated differently\nfrom \u201cpublic\u201d lands within the unit. Under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nreading of Section 103(c), however, the former is not an option,\nand the latter would require contorted and counterintuitive\nmeasures.We therefore reject the interpretation of\nSection 103(c) adopted by the court below. That reading of the\nstatute was the sole basis for the disposition of this case by the\nCourt of Appeals. We accordingly vacate the judgment of that court\nand remand for further proceedings.We do not reach the remainder of the parties\u2019\narguments. In particular, we do not decide whether the Nation River\nqualifies as \u201cpublic land\u201d for purposes of ANILCA. Sturgeon claims\nthat it does not; the Park Service that it does. The parties\u2019\narguments in this respect touch on vital issues of state\nsovereignty, on the one hand, and federal authority, on the other.\nWe find that in this case those issues should be addressed by the\nlower courts in the first instance.Given this determination, we also do not decide\nwhether the Park Service has authority under Section 100751(b) to\nregulate Sturgeon\u2019s activities on the Nation River, even if the\nriver is not \u201cpublic\u201d land, or whether\u2014as Sturgeon argues\u2014any such\nauthority is limited by ANILCA. Fin-ally, we do not consider the\nPark Service\u2019s alternative ar-gument that it has authority under\nANILCA over both \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cnon-public\u201d lands within the\nboundaries of conservation system units in Alaska, to the extent a\nregulation is written to apply specifically to both types of land.\nWe leave those arguments to the lower courts for consideration as\nnecessary.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.It is so ordered.",
