ROTHGERY, PETITIONERv.GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXASon writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit[June 23, 2008]Justice Thomas, dissenting.The Court holds today\u2014for the\nfirst time after plenary consideration of the question\u2014that a\ncriminal prosecution begins, and that the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel therefore attaches, when an individual who has been placed\nunder arrest makes an initial appearance before a magistrate for a\nprobable-cause determination and the setting of bail. Because the\nCourt\u2019s holding is not supported by the original meaning of the\nSixth Amendment or any reasonable interpretation of our precedents,\nI respectfully dissent.IThe Sixth Amendment provides that\n\u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right\n\u2026 to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The text of\nthe Sixth Amendment thus makes clear that the right to counsel\narises only upon initiation of a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n].\u201d For that\nreason, the Court has repeatedly stressed that the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel \u201cdoes not attach until a prosecution is\ncommenced.\u201dMcNeilv.Wisconsin,501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991); see alsoUnited Statesv.Gouveia,467 U. S. 180, 188\n(1984) (\u201c[T]he literal language of the Amendment \u2026 requires the\nexistence of both a \u2018criminal prosecutio[n]\u2019 and an\n\u2018accused\u2019\u00a0\u201d). Echoing this refrain, the Court today reiterates\nthat \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right of the \u2018accused\u2019 to assistance of\ncounsel in \u2018all criminal prosecutions\u2019 is limited by its terms.\u201dAnte, at 5 (footnote omitted).Given the Court\u2019s repeated\ninsistence that the right to counsel is textually limited to\n\u201ccriminal prosecutions,\u201d one would expect the Court\u2019s jurisprudence\nin this area to be grounded in an understanding of what those words\nmeant when the Sixth Amendment was adopted. Inexplicably, however,\nneither today\u2019s decision nor any of the other numerous decisions in\nwhich the Court has construed the right to counsel has attempted to\ndiscern the original meaning of \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n].\u201d I think\nit appropriate to examine what a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d would\nhave been understood to entail by those who adopted the Sixth\nAmendment.AThere is no better place to begin\nthan with Blackstone, \u201cwhose works constituted the preeminent\nauthority on English law for the founding generation.\u201dAldenv.Maine,527 U. S. 706, 715\n(1999). Blackstone devoted more than 100 pages of his Commentaries\non the Laws of England to a discussion of the \u201cregular and ordinary\nmethod of proceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries *289 (hereinafter Blackstone).At the outset of his discussion,\nBlackstone organized the various stages of a criminal proceeding\n\u201cunder twelve general heads, following each other in a progressive\norder.\u201dIbid.The first six relate to pretrial events: \u201c1.\nArrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3.Prosecution;4.\nProcess; 5. Arraignment, and it\u2019s incidents; 6. Plea, and issue.\u201dIbid.(emphasis added). Thus, the first significant fact\nis that Blackstone did not describe the entire criminal process as\na \u201cprosecution,\u201d but rather listed prosecution as the third step in\na list of successive stages. For a more complete understanding of\nwhat Blackstone meant by \u201cprosecution,\u201d however, we must turn to\nchapter 23, entitled \u201cOf the Several Modes of Prosecution.\u201dId., at *301. There, Blackstone explained that\u2014after\narrest and examination by a justice of the peace to determine\nwhether a suspect should be discharged, committed to prison, or\nadmitted to bail,id., at *296\u2014the \u201cnext step towards the\npunishment of offenders is theirprosecution,or the\nmanner of their formal accusation,\u201did., at *301\n(emphasis added).Blackstone thus provides a definition of\n\u201cprosecution\u201d: the manner of an offender\u2019s \u201cformal accusation.\u201d The\nmodifier \u201cformal\u201d is significant because it distinguishes\n\u201cprosecution\u201d from earlier stages of the process involving a\ndifferent kind of accusation: the allegation of criminal conduct\nnecessary to justify arrest and detention.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBlackstone\u2019s discussion of arrest, commitment, and bail makes clear\nthat a person could not be arrested and detained without a \u201ccharge\u201d\nor \u201caccusation,\u201di.e., an allegation, supported by\nprobable cause, that the person had committed a crime. Seeid., at *289\u2013*300. But the accusation justifying arrest\nand detention was clearly preliminary to the \u201cformal accusation\u201d\nthat Blackstone identified with \u201cprosecution.\u201d Seeid., at\n*290, *318.By \u201cformal accusation,\u201d Blackstone meant, in\nmost cases, \u201cindictment, the most usual and effectual means of\nprosecution.\u201dId., at *302. Blackstone defined an\n\u201cindictment\u201d as \u201ca written accusation of one or more persons of a\ncrime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon oath by, a\ngrand jury.\u201dIbid. (emphasis deleted). If the grand jury\nwas \u201csatisfied of the truth of the accusation,\u201d it endorsed the\nindictment,id., at *305\u2013*306, which was then \u201cpublicly\ndelivered into court,\u201did., at *306, \u201cafterwards to be\ntried and determined,\u201did., at *303, \u201cbefore an officer\nhaving power to punish the [charged] offence,\u201d 2 T. Cunningham, A\nNew and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).In addition to indictment, Blackstone\nidentified two other \u201cmethods of prosecution at the suit of the\nking.\u201d 4 Blackstone *312. The first was presentment, which, like an\nindictment, was a grand jury\u2019s formal accusation \u201cof an offence,\ninquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.\u201d 5 G. Jacob, The\nLaw-Dictionary 278\u2013279 (1811). The principal difference was that\nthe accusation arose from \u201cthe notice taken by a grand jury of any\noffence from their own knowledge or observation\u201d rather than from a\n\u201cbill of indictment laid before them.\u201d 4 Blackstone *301. The\nsecond was information, \u201cthe only species of proceeding at the suit\nof the king, without a previous indictment or presentment by a\ngrand jury.\u201dId., at *308. After an information was filed,\nit was \u201ctried,\u201did., at *309, in the same way as an\nindictment: \u201cThe same notice was given, the same process was\nissued, the same pleas were allowed, the same trial by jury was\nhad, the same judgment was given by the same judges, as if the\nprosecution had originally been by indictment,\u201did., at\n*310.From the foregoing, the basic elements of a\ncriminal \u201cprosecution\u201d emerge with reasonable clarity.\n\u201cProsecution,\u201d as Blackstone used the term, referred to\n\u201cinstituting a criminal suit,\u201did., at *309, by filing a\nformal charging document\u2014an indictment, presentment, or\ninformation\u2014upon which the defendant was to be tried in a court\nwith power to punish the alleged offense. And, significantly,\nBlackstone\u2019s usage appears to have accorded with the ordinary\nmeaning of the term. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of\nthe English Language (1828) (defining \u201cprosecution\u201d as \u201c[t]he\ninstitution or commencement and continuance of a criminal suit; the\nprocess of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a\nlegal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,\u201d and noting\nthat \u201c[p]rosecutionsmay be by presentment, information or\nindictment\u201d).BWith Blackstone as our guide, it\nis significant that the Framers used the words \u201ccriminal\nprosecutions\u201d in the Sixth Amendment rather than some other\nformulation such as \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d or \u201ccriminal cases.\u201d\nIndeed, elsewhere in the Bill of Rights we find just such an\nalternative formulation: In contrast to the Sixth Amendment, the\nFifth Amendment refers to \u201ccriminal case[s].\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5\n(\u201cNo person \u2026 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\nwitness against himself\u201d).InCounselmanv.Hitchcock,142 U. S. 547(1892),\nthe Court indicated that the difference in phraseology was not\naccidental. There the Court held that the Fifth Amendment right not\nto be compelled to be a witness against oneself \u201cin any criminal\ncase\u201d could be invoked by a witness testifying before a grand jury.\nThe Court rejected the argument that there could be no \u201ccriminal\ncase\u201d prior to indictment, reasoning that a \u201ccriminal case\u201d under\nthe Fifth Amendment is much broader than a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d\nunder the Sixth Amendment.Id., at 563.The following Term, the Court construed the\nphrase \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d in a statutory context, and this time\nthe Court squarely held that a \u201cprosecution\u201d does not encompass\npreindictment stages of the criminal process. InVirginiav.Paul,148 U. S. 107(1893),\nthe Court considered Revised Statute \u00a7643, which authorized removal\nto federal court of any \u201c\u00a0\u2018criminal prosecution\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018commenced in any court of a State\u2019\u00a0\u201d against a federal\nofficer.Id., at 115. The respondent, a deputy marshal,\nhad been arrested by Virginia authorities on a warrant for murder\nand was held in county jail awaiting his appearance before a\njustice of the peace \u201cwith a view to a commitment to await the\naction of the grand jury.\u201dId., at 118. He filed a\npetition for removal of \u201c\u00a0\u2018said cause\u2019\u00a0\u201d to federal\ncourt.Ibid. The question before the Court was whether a\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018criminal prosecution\u2019\u00a0\u201d had \u201c\u00a0\u2018commenced\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the statute at the time the respondent filed\nhis removal petition.The Court held that a criminal prosecution had\nnot commenced, and that removal was therefore not authorized by the\nterms of the statute. The Court noted that under Virginia law\nmurder could be prosecuted only \u201cby indictment found in the county\ncourt,\u201d and that \u201ca justice of the peace, upon a previous\ncomplaint, [could] do no more than to examine whether there [was]\ngood cause for believing that the accused [was] guilty, and to\ncommit him for trial before the court having jurisdiction of the\noffence.\u201dIbid. Accordingly, where \u201cno indictment was\nfound, or other action taken, in the county court,\u201d there was as\nyet no \u201c\u00a0\u2018criminal prosecution.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 119.\nThe appearance before the justice of the peace did not qualify as a\n\u201cprosecution\u201d:\u201cProceedings before a magistrate to commit a person\nto jail, or to hold him to bail, in order to secure his appearance\nto answer for a crime or offence which the magistrate has no\njurisdiction himself to try, before the court in which he may be\nprosecuted and tried, are but preliminary to the prosecution, and\nare no more a commencement of the prosecution, than is an arrest by\nan officer without a warrant for a felony committed in his\npresence.\u201dIbid.CThe foregoing historical summary\nis strong evidence that the term \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d in the\nSixth Amendment refers to the commencement of a criminal suit by\nfiling formal charges in a court with jurisdiction to try and\npunish the defendant. And on this understanding of the Sixth\nAmendment, it is clear that petitioner\u2019s initial appearance before\nthe magistrate did not commence a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n].\u201d No\nformal charges had been filed. The only document submitted to the\nmagistrate was the arresting officer\u2019s affidavit of probable cause.\nThe officer stated that he \u201cha[d] good reason to believe\u201d that\npetitioner was a felon and had been \u201cwalking around [an] RV park\nwith a gun belt on, carrying a pistol, handcuffs, mace spray, extra\nbullets and a knife.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. The officer\ntherefore \u201ccharge[d]\u201d that petitioner had \u201ccommit[ted] the offense\nof unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon\u20143rd degree felony.\u201dIbid. The magistrate certified that he had examined the\naffidavit and \u201cdetermined that probable cause existed for the\narrest of the individual accused therein.\u201dId., at 34a.\nLater that day, petitioner was released on bail, and did not hear\nfrom the State again until he was indicted six months later.The affidavit of probable cause\nclearly was not the type of formal accusation Blackstone identified\nwith the commencement of a criminal \u201cprosecution.\u201d Rather, it was\nthe preliminary accusation necessary to justify arrest and\ndetention\u2014stages of the criminal process that Blackstone placed\nbefore prosecution. The affidavit was not a pleading that\ninstituted a criminal prosecution, such as an indictment,\npresentment, or information; and the magistrate to whom it was\npresented had no jurisdiction to try and convict petitioner for the\nfelony offense charged therein. SeeTealv.State, 230 S.\u00a0W. 3d 172, 174 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)\n(\u201cThe Texas Constitution requires that, unless waived by the\ndefendant, the State must obtain a grand jury indictment in a\nfelony case\u201d); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Arts. 4.05, 4.11(a)\n(West 2005). That is most assuredly why the magistrate informed\npetitioner that charges \u201cwill befiled\u201d in district court.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 35a (emphasis added).The original meaning of the Sixth Amendment,\nthen, cuts decisively against the Court\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioner\u2019s right to counsel attached at his initial appearance\nbefore the magistrate. But we are not writing on a blank slate:\nThis Court has a substantial body of more recent precedent\nconstruing the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.IIAs the Court notes, our cases\nhave \u201cpegged commencement\u201d of a criminal prosecution,ante, at 5, to \u201cthe initiation of adversary judicial\ncriminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary\nhearing, indictment, information, or arraignment,\u201dKirbyv.Illinois,406 U. S. 682, 689\n(1972) (plurality opinion). The Court has repeated this formulation\nin virtually every right-to-counsel case decided sinceKirby. BecauseKirby\u2019s formulation of the\nattachment test has been accorded such precedential significance,\nit is important to determine precisely whatKirbysaid:\u201cIn a line of constitutional\ncases in this Court stemming back to the Court\u2019s landmark opinion\ninPowellv.Alabama,287 U. S. 45[(1932)], it has been\nfirmly established that a person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment\nright to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary\njudicial proceedings have been initiated against him. SeePowellv.Alabama,supra; Johnsonv.Zerbst,304 U. S. 458[(1938)];Hamiltonv.Alabama,368 U.\nS. 52[(1961)];Gideonv.Wainwright,372 U. S. 335[(1963)];Whitev.Maryland,373 U.\nS. 59[(1963)(per curiam)];Massiahv.United States,377 U. S. 201[(1964)];United\nStatesv.Wade,388 U. S. 218[(1967)];Gilbertv.California,388 U. S. 263[(1967)];Colemanv.Alabama,399 U. S. 1[(1970)].\u201cThis is not to say that a defendant in a\ncriminal case has a constitutional right to counsel only at the\ntrial itself. ThePowellcase makes clear that the right\nattaches at the time of arraignment, and the Court has recently\nheld that it exists also at the time of a preliminary hearing.Colemanv.Alabama,supra. But the point\nis that, while members of the Court have differed as to existence\nof the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases,allof those cases have involved points of time at or\nafter the initiation of adversary judicial criminal\nproceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing,\nindictment, information, or arraignment.\u201dId., at 688\u2013689\n(footnote omitted).It is noteworthy thatKirbydid not purport to announce anything new; rather, it\nsimply catalogued what the Court had previously held. And the point\nof the plurality\u2019s discussion was that the criminal process\ncontains stagesprior tocommencement of a criminal\nprosecution. The holding of the case was that the right to counsel\ndid not apply at a station house lineup that took place\n\u201cbeforethe defendant had been indicted or otherwise\nformally charged with any criminal offense.\u201dId., at\n684.Kirbygave five examples of events\nthat initiate \u201cadversary judicial criminal proceedings\u201d: formal\ncharge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, and\narraignment. None of these supports the result the Court reaches\ntoday. I will apply themseriatim. No indictment or\ninformation had been filed when petitioner appeared before the\nmagistrate. Nor was there any other formal charge. Although the\nplurality inKirbydid not define \u201cformal charge,\u201d there\nis no reason to believe it would have included an affidavit of\nprobable cause in that category. None of the cases on which it\nrelied stood for that proposition. Indeed, all of them\u2014with the\nexception ofWhitev.Maryland,373 U.\nS. 59(1963)(per curiam), andColemanv.Alabama,399 U. S. 1(1970)\u2014involved\npostindictment proceedings. SeePowellv.Alabama,287 U. S. 45, 49 (1932) (postindictment\narraignment);Johnsonv.Zerbst,304 U. S. 458, 460 (1938) (trial);Hamiltonv.Alabama,368 U.\nS. 52, 53, n.\u00a03 (1961) (postindictment arraignment);Gideonv.Wainwright,372 U. S. 335, 337 (1963) (trial);Massiahv.United States,377 U. S. 201(1964) (postindictment\ninterrogation);United Statesv.Wade,388 U. S. 218, 219\u2013220 (1967)\n(postindictment lineup);Gilbertv.California,388 U. S. 263, 269 (1967)\n(postindictment lineup).Nor was petitioner\u2019s initial appearance a\npreliminary hearing. The comparable proceeding in Texas is called\nan \u201cexamining trial.\u201d Seeante, at 9, n.\u00a012. More\nimportantly, petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was unlike the\npreliminary hearings that were held to constitute \u201ccritical stages\u201d\ninWhiteandColeman, because it did not involve\nentry of a plea, cf.White,supra, at 60, and was\nnonadversarial, cf.Coleman,supra, at 9. There\nwas no prosecutor present, there were no witnesses to\ncross-examine, there was no case to discover, and the result of the\nproceeding was not to bind petitioner over to the grand jury or the\ntrial court.Finally, petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was\nnot whatKirbydescribed as an \u201carraignment.\u201d An\narraignment, in its traditional and usual sense, is a\npostindictment proceeding at which the defendant enters a plea.\nSee,e.g., W.\u00a0LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King,\nCriminal Procedure \u00a71.3(n), p. 19 (4th ed. 2004); 4 Blackstone\n*322. Although the word \u201carraignment\u201d is sometimes used to describe\nan initial appearance before a magistrate, see LaFave,supra, \u00a71.3(j), at 16, that is not whatKirbymeant when it said that the right to counsel attaches at an\n\u201carraignment.\u201d Rather, it meant the traditional, postindictment\narraignment where the defendant enters a plea. This would be the\nmost reasonable assumption even if there were nothing else to go\non, since that is the primary meaning of the word, especially when\nused unmodified.But there is no need to assume.Kirbypurported to describe only what the Court had already held, and\nnone of the casesKirbycited involved an initial\nappearance. Only two of the cases involved arraignments, and both\nwere postindictment arraignments at which the defendant entered a\nplea.Hamilton,supra, at 53, n.\u00a03;Powell, 287 U. S., at 49. And the considerations that\ndrove the Court\u2019s analysis in those cases are not present here. Seeid.,at 57 (emphasizing that \u201cfrom the time of their\narraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation,\nthoroughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally important,\nthe defendants did not have the aid of counsel\u201d);Hamilton,supra, at 53\u201355 (emphasizing that the\ndefendant entered a plea and was required to raise or waive certain\ndefenses).Kirby\u2019s inclusion of \u201carraignment\u201d in the list\nof adversary judicial proceedings that trigger the right to counsel\nthus provides no support for the view that the right to counsel\nattaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate.IIIIt is clear that whenKirbywas decided in 1972 there was no precedent in this\nCourt for the conclusion that a criminal prosecution begins, and\nthe right to counsel therefore attaches, at an initial appearance\nbefore a magistrate. The Court concludes, however, that two\nsubsequent decisions\u2014Brewerv.Williams,430 U. S. 387(1977),\nandMichiganv.Jackson,475 U. S. 625(1986)\u2014stand for that proposition. Those decisions, which relied\nalmost exclusively onKirby, cannot bear the weight the\nCourt puts on them.[Footnote\n1]InBrewer, the defendant\nchallenged his conviction for murdering a 10-year-old girl on the\nground that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated\nwhen detectives elicited incriminating statements from him while\ntransporting him from Davenport, Iowa, where he had been arrested\non a warrant for abduction and \u201carraigned before a judge \u2026 on the\noutstanding arrest warrant,\u201d to Des Moines, where he was to be\ntried. 430 U. S., at 390\u2013391. The principal issue was whether the\ndefendant had waived his right to have counsel present during\npolice questioning when he voluntarily engaged one of the\ndetectives in a \u201cwide-ranging conversation.\u201dId.,at 392.\nHe subsequently agreed to lead the detectives to the girl\u2019s body in\nresponse to the so-called \u201c\u00a0\u2018Christian burial speech,\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nin which one of the detectives told the defendant that \u201c\u00a0\u2018the\nparents of this little girl should be entitled to a Christian\nburial for the little girl who was snatched away from them on\nChristmas [E]ve and murdered.\u2019\u00a0\u201dId., at 392\u2013393. Not\nsurprisingly, the parties vigorously disputed the waiver issue, and\nit sharply divided the Court.In contrast, the question whether the\ndefendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached was neither raised in the\ncourts below nor disputed before this Court. Nonetheless, the\nCourt, after quotingKirby\u2019s formulation of the test,\noffered its conclusory observations:\u201cThere can be no doubt in the\npresent case that judicial proceedings had been initiated against\nWilliams before the start of the automobile ride from Davenport to\nDes Moines. A warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been\narraigned on that warrant before a judge in a Davenport courtroom,\nand he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail. The\nState does not contend otherwise.\u201d 430 U. S., at 399.Brewer\u2019s cursory\ntreatment of the attachment issue demonstrates precisely why, when\n\u201can issue [is] not addressed by the parties,\u201d it is \u201cimprudent of\nus to address it \u2026 with any pretense of settling it for all time.\u201dMetropolitan Stevedore Co.v.Rambo,521 U. S. 121, 136\n(1997). As an initial matter, the Court\u2019s discussion of the facts\nreveals little about what happened at the proceeding. There is no\nindication, for example, whether it was adversarial or whether the\ndefendant was required to enter a plea or raise or waive any\ndefenses\u2014facts that earlier cases such asHamilton,White, andColemanhad found significant.Even assuming, however, that the arraignment\ninBrewerwas functionally identical to the initial\nappearance here,Breweroffered no reasoning for its\nconclusion that the right to counsel attached at such a proceeding.\nOne is left with the distinct impression that the Court simply saw\nthe word \u201carraignment\u201d inKirby\u2019s attachment test and\nconcluded that the right must have attached because the defendant\nhad been \u201carraigned.\u201d There is no indication thatBrewerconsidered the difference between an arraignment on a warrant and\nan arraignment at which the defendant pleads to the indictment.The Court finds it significant thatBrewerexpressed \u201c\u00a0\u2018no doubt\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the right\nhad attached.Ante, at 19 (quoting 430 U. S., at 399).\nThere was no need for a \u201clengthy disquisitio[n],\u201d the Court says,\nbecauseBrewerpurportedly \u201cfound the attachment issue an\neasy one.\u201dAnte, at 18\u201319. What the Court neglects to\nmention is thatBrewer\u2019s attachment holding is\nindisputably no longer good law. That is because we have\nsubsequently held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is\n\u201coffense specific,\u201d meaning that it attaches only to those offenses\nfor which the defendant has been formally charged, and not to\n\u201cother offenses \u2018closely related factually\u2019 to the charged\noffense.\u201dTexasv.Cobb,532 U. S. 162, 164\n(2001). Because the defendant inBrewerhad been arraigned\nonly on the abduction warrant, there is no doubt that, underCobb, his right to counsel had not yet attached with\nrespect to the murder charges that were subsequently brought. See\n532 U. S., at 184 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that under the\nmajority\u2019s rule, \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] murder conviction should have\nremained undisturbed\u201d). But the Court inCobbdid not\nconsider itself bound byBrewer\u2019s implicit holding on the\nattachment question. See 532 U. S., at 169 (\u201cConstitutional rights\nare not defined by inferences from opinions which did not address\nthe question at issue\u201d). And here, as inCobb,Brewerdid not address the fact that the arraignment on\nthe warrant was not the same type of arraignment at which the right\nto counsel had previously been held to attach, and the parties did\nnot argue the question.Breweris thus entitled to no more\nprecedential weight here than it was inCobb.Nor doesJacksoncontrol. InJackson, as inBrewer, the attachment issue was\nsecondary. The question presented was \u201cnot whether respondents had\na right to counsel at their postarraignment, custodial\ninterrogations,\u201d 475 U. S., at 629, but \u201cwhether respondents\nvalidly waived their right to counsel,\u201did., at 630. And,\nas inBrewer, the Court\u2019s waiver holding was vigorously\ndisputed. See 475 U. S., at 637\u2013642 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting);\nsee alsoCobb, supra, at 174\u2013177 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(questioningJackson\u2019s vitality). Unlike inBrewer, however, the attachment question was at least\ncontested inJackson\u2014but barely. With respect to\nrespondent Jackson, the State conceded the issue.Jackson,supra, at 629, n.\u00a03. And with respect to respondent\nBladel, the State had conceded the issue below, seePeoplev.Bladel, 421 Mich. 39, 77, 365 N.\u00a0W. 2d 56, 74\n(1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting), and raised it for the first time\nbefore this Court, devoting only three pages of its brief to the\nquestion, see Brief for Petitioner inMichiganv.Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84\u20131539, pp. 24\u201326.The Court disposed of the issue in a footnote.\nSeeJackson,supra, at 629\u2013630, n.\u00a03. As inBrewer, the Court did not describe the nature of the\nproceeding. It stated only that the respondents were \u201carraigned.\u201d\n475 U. S., at 627\u2013628. The Court phrased the question presented in\nterms of \u201carraignment,\u201did., at 626 (\u201cThe question\npresented by these two cases is whether the same rule applies to a\ndefendant who has been formally charged with a crime and who has\nrequested appointment of counsel at his arraignment\u201d), and repeated\nthe words \u201carraignment\u201d or \u201cpostarraignment\u201d no fewer than 35 times\nin the course of its opinion.There is no way to know from the Court\u2019s\nopinion inJacksonwhether the arraignment at issue there\nwas the same type of arraignment at which the right to counsel had\nbeen held to attach inPowellandHamilton. Only\nupon examination of the parties\u2019 briefs does it become clear that\nthe proceeding was in fact an initial appearance. ButJacksondid not even acknowledge, much less \u201cflatly\nrejec[t] the distinction between initial arraignment and\narraignment on the indictment.\u201dAnte, at 9. Instead, it\noffered one sentence of analysis\u2014\u201cIn view of the clear language in\nour decisions about the significance of arraignment, the State\u2019s\nargument is untenable\u201d\u2014followed by a string citation to four cases,\neach of which quotedKirby. 475 U. S., at 629\u2013630,\nn.\u00a03. For emphasis, the Court italicized the words \u201cor\narraignment\u201d inKirby\u2019s attachment test. 475 U. S., at\n629, n.\u00a03 (internal quotation marks omitted).The only rule that can be derived from the\nface of the opinion inJacksonis that if a proceeding is\ncalled an \u201carraignment,\u201d the right to counsel attaches.[Footnote 2] That rule would not govern\nthis case because petitioner\u2019s initial appearance was not called an\n\u201carraignment\u201d (the parties refer to it as a \u201cmagistration\u201d). And\nthat would, in any case, be a silly rule. The Sixth Amendment\nconsequences of a proceeding should turn on the substance of what\nhappens there, not on what the State chooses to call it. But the\nCourt inJacksondid not focus on the substantive\ndistinction between an initial arraignment and an arraignment on\nthe indictment. Instead, the Court simply citedKirbyand\nleft it at that. In these circumstances, I would recognizeJacksonfor what it was\u2014a cursory treatment of an issue\nthat was not the primary focus of the Court\u2019s opinion. SurelyJackson\u2019s footnote must yield to our reasoned\nprecedents.And our reasoned precedents provide no support\nfor the conclusion that the right to counsel attaches at an initial\nappearance before a magistrate.Kirbyexplained why the\nright attaches \u201cafter the initiation of adversary judicial criminal\nproceedings\u201d:\u201cThe initiation of judicial\ncriminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the\nstarting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice.\nFor it is only then that the government has committed itself to\nprosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government\nand defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds\nhimself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society,\nand immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural\ncriminal law. It is this point, therefore, that marks the\ncommencement of the \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the\nexplicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\u201d 406 U.\nS., at 689\u2013690 (plurality opinion).None of these defining\ncharacteristics of a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d applies to petitioner\u2019s\ninitial appearance before the magistrate. The initial appearance\nwas not an \u201cadversary\u201d proceeding, and petitioner was not \u201cfaced\nwith the prosecutorial forces of organized society.\u201d Instead, he\nstood in front of a \u201clittle glass window,\u201d filled out various\nforms, and was read hisMirandarights. Brief for\nRespondent 5. The State had not committed itself to prosecute\u2014only\na prosecutor may file felony charges in Texas, see Tex. Code Ann.,\nCrim. Proc. Arts. 2.01, 2.02 (West 2005), and there is no evidence\nthat any prosecutor was even aware of petitioner\u2019s arrest or\nappearance. The adverse positions of government and defendant had\nnot yet solidified\u2014the State\u2019s prosecutorial officers had not yet\ndecided whether to press charges and, if so, which charges to\npress. And petitioner was not immersed in the intricacies of\nsubstantive and procedural criminal law\u2014shortly after the\nproceeding he was free on bail, and no further proceedings occurred\nuntil six months later when he was indicted.Moreover, the Court\u2019s holding that the right\nto counsel attaches at an initial appearance is untethered from any\ninterest that we have heretofore associated with the right to\ncounsel. The Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[t]he purpose of\nthe constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an\naccused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his\nlegal and constitutional rights.\u201dJohnson, 304 U. S., at\n465. The \u201ccore purpose\u201d of the right, the Court has said, is to\n\u201cassure \u2018Assistance\u2019 at trial, when the accused [is] confronted\nwith both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public\nprosecutor.\u201dUnited Statesv.Ash,413 U. S. 300, 309\n(1973). The Court has extended the right to counsel to pretrial\nevents only when the absence of counsel would derogate from the\ndefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. See,e.g.,Wade, 388 U. S., at 227.Neither petitioner nor the Court identifies\nany way in which petitioner\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial was\nundermined by the absence of counsel during the period between his\ninitial appearance and his indictment. Nothing during that period\nexposed petitioner to the risk that he would be convicted as the\nresult of ignorance of his rights. Instead, the gravamen of\npetitioner\u2019s complaint is that if counsel had been appointed\nearlier, he would have been able to stave off indictment by\nconvincing the prosecutor that petitioner was not guilty of the\ncrime alleged. But the Sixth Amendment protects against the risk of\nerroneousconviction, not the risk of unwarrantedprosecution. SeeGouveia, 467 U. S., at 191\n(rejecting the notion that the \u201cpurpose of the right to counsel is\nto provide a defendant with a preindictment private\ninvestigator\u201d).Petitioner argues that the right to counsel is\nimplicated here because restrictions were imposed on his liberty\nwhen he was required to post bail. But we have never suggested that\nthe accused\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel \u201cfor his defence\u201d\nentails a right to use counsel as a sword to contest pretrial\ndetention. To the contrary, we have flatly rejected that notion,\nreasoning that a defendant\u2019s liberty interests are protected by\nother constitutional guarantees. Seeid., at 190 (\u201cWhile\nthe right to counsel exists to protect the accused during\ntrial-type confrontations with the prosecutor, the speedy trial\nright exists primarily to protect an individual\u2019s liberty\ninterest,\u201d including the interest in reducing the\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released\non bail\u2019\u00a0\u201d).IVIn sum, neither the original\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel nor our precedents\ninterpreting the scope of that right supports the Court\u2019s holding\nthat the right attaches at an initial appearance before a\nmagistrate. Because I would affirm the judgment below,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.Footnote 1The Court also relies onMcNeilv.Wisconsin,501 U. S. 171(1991), to support its\nassertion that the right to counsel attaches upon an initial\nappearance before a magistrate.Ante, at 10\u201311. But inMcNeil, the Court expressed no view whatsoever on the\nattachment issue. Rather, it noted that the issue was \u201cundisputed,\u201d\nand \u201caccept[ed] for purposes of the present case, that \u2026 [the\ndefendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right had attached.\u201d 501 U. S., at\n175. We do not ordinarily give weight to assumptions made in prior\ncases about matters that were not in dispute.Footnote 2The Court asserts thatJackson\u2019s\n\u201cconclusion was driven by the same considerations the Court had\nendorsed inBrewer,\u201d namely, that \u201cby the time a defendant\nis brought before a judicial officer, is informed of a formally\nlodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his liberty in\naid of the prosecution, the State\u2019s relationship with the defendant\nhas become solidly adversarial.\u201dAnte, at 9. ButJacksonsaid nothing of the sort.Moreover, even looking behind the opinion,Jacksondoes not support the result the Court reaches\ntoday. Respondent Bladel entered a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea at his\narraignment, see Brief for Petitioner inMichiganv.Bladel, O. T. 1985, No. 84\u20131539, p.\u00a04, and bothHamiltonv.Alabama,368 U.\nS. 52(1961), andWhitev.Maryland,373 U.\nS. 59(1963)(per curiam), had already held that a\ndefendant has a right to counsel when he enters a plea. The Court\nsuggests that this fact is irrelevant because the magistrate in\nBladel\u2019s case \u201chad no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a\nfelony charge.\u201dAnte, at 10, n.\u00a013. But that\ndistinction does not appear in eitherHamiltonorWhite. SeeHamilton,supra, at 55 (\u201cOnly\nthe presence of counsel could have enabled this accused to know all\nthe defenses available to him and to plead intelligently\u201d);White,supra, at 60 (\u201c[P]etitioner entered a plea\nbefore the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had\nno counsel\u201d). Thus, the most thatJacksoncan possibly be\nmade to stand for is that the right to counsel attaches at an\ninitial appearance where the defendant enters a plea. And that rule\nwould not govern this case because petitioner did not enter a plea\nat his initial appearance.",
